Goodfellow, Jean Pouget-Abadie\u0003, Mehdi Mirza, Bing Xu, David Warde-Farley,\nSherjil Ozairy, Aaron Courville, Yoshua Bengioz\nD´epartement d’informatique et de recherche op ´erationnelle\nUniversit ´e de Montr ´eal\nMontr ´eal, QC H3C 3J7\nAbstract\nWe propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversar-\nial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G\nthat captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model Dthat estimates\nthe probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The train-\ning procedure for Gis to maximize the probability of Dmaking a mistake. This\nframework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary\nfunctionsGandD, a unique solution exists, with Grecovering the training data\ndistribution and Dequal to1\n2everywhere. In the case where GandDare deﬁned\nby multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation.\nThere is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference net-\nworks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate\nthe potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of\nthe generated samples.\n1 Introduction\nThe promise of deep learning is to discover rich, hierarchical models [2] that represent probability\ndistributions over the kinds of data encountered in artiﬁcial intelligence applications, such as natural\nimages, audio waveforms containing speech, and symbols in natural language corpora. So far, the\nmost striking successes in deep learning have involved discriminative models, usually those that\nmap a high-dimensional, rich sensory input to a class label [14, 22]. These striking successes have\nprimarily been based on the backpropagation and dropout algorithms, using piecewise linear units\n[19, 9, 10] which have a particularly well-behaved gradient . Deep generative models have had less\nof an impact, due to the difﬁculty of approximating many intractable probabilistic computations that\narise in maximum likelihood estimation and related strategies, and due to difﬁculty of leveraging\nthe beneﬁts of piecewise linear units in the generative context. We propose a new generative model\nestimation procedure that sidesteps these difﬁculties.1\nIn the proposed adversarial nets framework, the generative model is pitted against an adversary: a\ndiscriminative model that learns to determine whether a sample is from the model distribution or the\ndata distribution. The generative model can be thought of as analogous to a team of counterfeiters,\ntrying to produce fake currency and use it without detection, while the discriminative model is\nanalogous to the police, trying to detect the counterfeit currency. Competition in this game drives\nboth teams to improve their methods until the counterfeits are indistiguishable from the genuine\narticles.\n\u0003Jean Pouget-Abadie is visiting Universit ´e de Montr ´eal from Ecole Polytechnique.\nySherjil Ozair is visiting Universit ´e de Montr ´eal from Indian Institute of Technology Delhi\nzYoshua Bengio is a CIFAR Senior Fellow.\n1All code and hyperparameters available at http://www.github.com/goodfeli/adversarial\n1arXiv:1406.2661v1  [stat.ML]  10 Jun 2014\nThis framework can yield speciﬁc training algorithms for many kinds of model and optimization\nalgorithm. In this article, we explore the special case when the generative model generates samples\nby passing random noise through a multilayer perceptron, and the discriminative model is also a\nmultilayer perceptron. We refer to this special case as adversarial nets . In this case, we can train\nboth models using only the highly successful backpropagation and dropout algorithms [17] and\nsample from the generative model using only forward propagation. No approximate inference or\nMarkov chains are necessary.\n2 Related work\nAn alternative to directed graphical models with latent variables are undirected graphical models\nwith latent variables, such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) [27, 16], deep Boltzmann\nmachines (DBMs) [26] and their numerous variants. The interactions within such models are\nrepresented as the product of unnormalized potential functions, normalized by a global summa-\ntion/integration over all states of the random variables. This quantity (the partition function ) and\nits gradient are intractable for all but the most trivial instances, although they can be estimated by\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Mixing poses a signiﬁcant problem for learning\nalgorithms that rely on MCMC [3, 5].\nDeep belief networks (DBNs) [16] are hybrid models containing a single undirected layer and sev-\neral directed layers. While a fast approximate layer-wise training criterion exists, DBNs incur the\ncomputational difﬁculties associated with both undirected and directed models.\nAlternative criteria that do not approximate or bound the log-likelihood have also been proposed,\nsuch as score matching [18] and noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) [13]. Both of these require the\nlearned probability density to be analytically speciﬁed up to a normalization constant. Note that\nin many interesting generative models with several layers of latent variables (such as DBNs and\nDBMs), it is not even possible to derive a tractable unnormalized probability density. Some models\nsuch as denoising auto-encoders [30] and contractive autoencoders have learning rules very similar\nto score matching applied to RBMs. In NCE, as in this work, a discriminative training criterion is\nemployed to ﬁt a generative model. However, rather than ﬁtting a separate discriminative model, the\ngenerative model itself is used to discriminate generated data from samples a ﬁxed noise distribution.\nBecause NCE uses a ﬁxed noise distribution, learning slows dramatically after the model has learned\neven an approximately correct distribution over a small subset of the observed variables.\nFinally, some techniques do not involve deﬁning a probability distribution explicitly, but rather train\na generative machine to draw samples from the desired distribution. This approach has the advantage\nthat such machines can be designed to be trained by back-propagation. Prominent recent work in this\narea includes the generative stochastic network (GSN) framework [5], which extends generalized\ndenoising auto-encoders [4]: both can be seen as deﬁning a parameterized Markov chain, i.e., one\nlearns the parameters of a machine that performs one step of a generative Markov chain. Compared\nto GSNs, the adversarial nets framework does not require a Markov chain for sampling. Because\nadversarial nets do not require feedback loops during generation, they are better able to leverage\npiecewise linear units [19, 9, 10], which improve the performance of backpropagation but have\nproblems with unbounded activation when used ina feedback loop. More recent examples of training\na generative machine by back-propagating into it include recent work on auto-encoding variational\nBayes [20] and stochastic backpropagation [24].\n3 Adversarial nets\nThe adversarial modeling framework is most straightforward to apply when the models are both\nmultilayer perceptrons. To learn the generator’s distribution pgover data x, we deﬁne a prior on\ninput noise variables pz(z), then represent a mapping to data space as G(z;\u0012g), whereGis a\ndifferentiable function represented by a multilayer perceptron with parameters \u0012g. We also deﬁne a\nsecond multilayer perceptron D(x;\u0012d)that outputs a single scalar. D(x)represents the probability\nthatxcame from the data rather than pg. We trainDto maximize the probability of assigning the\ncorrect label to both training examples and samples from G. We simultaneously train Gto minimize\nlog(1\u0000D(G(z))):\n2\nIn other words, DandGplay the following two-player minimax game with value function V(G;D ):\nmin\nGmax\nDV(D;G ) =Ex\u0018pdata(x)[logD(x)] +Ez\u0018pz(z)[log(1\u0000D(G(z)))]: (1)\nIn the next section, we present a theoretical analysis of adversarial nets, essentially showing that\nthe training criterion allows one to recover the data generating distribution as GandDare given\nenough capacity, i.e., in the non-parametric limit. See Figure 1 for a less formal, more pedagogical\nexplanation of the approach. In practice, we must implement the game using an iterative, numerical\napproach. Optimizing Dto completion in the inner loop of training is computationally prohibitive,\nand on ﬁnite datasets would result in overﬁtting. Instead, we alternate between ksteps of optimizing\nDand one step of optimizing G. This results in Dbeing maintained near its optimal solution, so\nlong asGchanges slowly enough. This strategy is analogous to the way that SML/PCD [31, 29]\ntraining maintains samples from a Markov chain from one learning step to the next in order to avoid\nburning in a Markov chain as part of the inner loop of learning. The procedure is formally presented\nin Algorithm 1.\nIn practice, equation 1 may not provide sufﬁcient gradient for Gto learn well. Early in learning,\nwhenGis poor,Dcan reject samples with high conﬁdence because they are clearly different from\nthe training data. In this case, log(1\u0000D(G(z)))saturates. Rather than training Gto minimize\nlog(1\u0000D(G(z)))we can train Gto maximize logD(G(z)). This objective function results in the\nsame ﬁxed point of the dynamics of GandDbut provides much stronger gradients early in learning.\nx\nz\nX\nZ\nX\nZ\n. . .\nX\nZ\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\nFigure 1: Generative adversarial nets are trained by simultaneously updating the discriminative distribution\n(D, blue, dashed line) so that it discriminates between samples from the data generating distribution (black,\ndotted line)pxfrom those of the generative distribution pg(G) (green, solid line).

(d) After several steps of training, if GandDhave enough capacity, they will reach a\npoint at which both cannot improve because pg=pdata.

Therefore, we would like Algorithm 1 to converge to a good estimator\nofpdata, if given enough capacity and training time. The results of this section are done in a non-\nparametric setting, e.g. we represent a model with inﬁnite capacity by studying convergence in the\nspace of probability density functions.\nWe will show in section 4.1 that this minimax game has a global optimum for pg=pdata. We will\nthen show in section 4.2 that Algorithm 1 optimizes Eq 1, thus obtaining the desired result.\n3\nAlgorithm 1 Minibatch stochastic gradient descent training of generative adversarial nets.

ForGﬁxed, the optimal discriminator Dis\nD\u0003\nG(x) =pdata(x)\npdata(x) +pg(x)(2)\nProof. The training criterion for the discriminator D, given any generator G, is to maximize the\nquantityV(G;D )\nV(G;D ) =Z\nxpdata(x) log(D(x))dx+Z\nzpz(z) log(1\u0000D(g(z)))dz\n=Z\nxpdata(x) log(D(x)) +pg(x) log(1\u0000D(x))dx (3)\nFor any (a;b)2R2nf0;0g, the function y!alog(y) +blog(1\u0000y)achieves its maximum in\n[0;1]ata\na+b. The discriminator does not need to be deﬁned outside of Supp (pdata)[Supp (pg),\nconcluding the proof.\nNote that the training objective for Dcan be interpreted as maximizing the log-likelihood for es-\ntimating the conditional probability P(Y=yjx), whereYindicates whether xcomes from pdata\n(withy= 1) or frompg(withy= 0). The minimax game in Eq. 1 can now be reformulated as:\nC(G) = max\nDV(G;D )\n=Ex\u0018pdata[logD\u0003\nG(x)] +Ez\u0018pz[log(1\u0000D\u0003\nG(G(z)))] (4)\n=Ex\u0018pdata[logD\u0003\nG(x)] +Ex\u0018pg[log(1\u0000D\u0003\nG(x))]\n=Ex\u0018pdata\u0014\nlogpdata(x)\nPdata(x) +pg(x)\u0015\n+Ex\u0018pg\u0014\nlogpg(x)\npdata(x) +pg(x)\u0015\n4\nTheorem 1. The global minimum of the virtual training criterion C(G)is achieved if and only if\npg=pdata. At that point, C(G)achieves the value \u0000log 4 .\nProof. Forpg=pdata,D\u0003\nG(x) =1\n2, (consider Eq. 2). Hence, by inspecting Eq. 4 at D\u0003\nG(x) =1\n2, we\nﬁndC(G) = log1\n2+ log1\n2=\u0000log 4 . To see that this is the best possible value of C(G), reached\nonly forpg=pdata, observe that\nEx\u0018pdata[\u0000log 2] + Ex\u0018pg[\u0000log 2] =\u0000log 4\nand that by subtracting this expression from C(G) =V(D\u0003\nG;G), we obtain:\nC(G) =\u0000log(4) +KL\u0012\npdata\r\r\r\rpdata+pg\n2\u0013\n+KL\u0012\npg\r\r\r\rpdata+pg\n2\u0013\n(5)\nwhere KL is the Kullback–Leibler divergence. We recognize in the previous expression the Jensen–\nShannon divergence between the model’s distribution and the data generating process:\nC(G) =\u0000log(4) + 2\u0001JSD (pdatakpg) (6)\nSince the Jensen–Shannon divergence between two distributions is always non-negative and zero\nonly when they are equal, we have shown that C\u0003=\u0000log(4) is the global minimum of C(G)and\nthat the only solution is pg=pdata, i.e., the generative model perfectly replicating the data generating\nprocess.\n4.2 Convergence of Algorithm 1\nProposition 2. IfGandDhave enough capacity, and at each step of Algorithm 1, the discriminator\nis allowed to reach its optimum given G, andpgis updated so as to improve the criterion\nEx\u0018pdata[logD\u0003\nG(x)] +Ex\u0018pg[log(1\u0000D\u0003\nG(x))]\nthenpgconverges to pdata\nProof. ConsiderV(G;D ) =U(pg;D)as a function of pgas done in the above criterion. Note\nthatU(pg;D)is convex in pg. The subderivatives of a supremum of convex functions include the\nderivative of the function at the point where the maximum is attained. In other words, if f(x) =\nsup\u000b2Af\u000b(x)andf\u000b(x)is convex in xfor every\u000b, then@f\f(x)2@fif\f= arg sup\u000b2Af\u000b(x).\nThis is equivalent to computing a gradient descent update for pgat the optimal Dgiven the cor-\nrespondingG.supDU(pg;D)is convex in pgwith a unique global optima as proven in Thm 1,\ntherefore with sufﬁciently small updates of pg,pgconverges to px, concluding the proof.\nIn practice, adversarial nets represent a limited family of pgdistributions via the function G(z;\u0012g),\nand we optimize \u0012grather thanpgitself. Using a multilayer perceptron to deﬁne Gintroduces\nmultiple critical points in parameter space. However, the excellent performance of multilayer per-\nceptrons in practice suggests that they are a reasonable model to use despite their lack of theoretical\nguarantees.\n5 Experiments\nWe trained adversarial nets an a range of datasets including MNIST[23], the Toronto Face Database\n(TFD) [28], and CIFAR-10 [21]. The generator nets used a mixture of rectiﬁer linear activations [19,\n9] and sigmoid activations, while the discriminator net used maxout [10] activations. Dropout [17]\nwas applied in training the discriminator net. While our theoretical framework permits the use of\ndropout and other noise at intermediate layers of the generator, we used noise as the input to only\nthe bottommost layer of the generator network.\nWe estimate probability of the test set data under pgby ﬁtting a Gaussian Parzen window to the\nsamples generated with Gand reporting the log-likelihood under this distribution.

The reported numbers on MNIST are the mean log-\nlikelihood of samples on test set, with the standard error of the mean computed across examples. On TFD, we\ncomputed the standard error across folds of the dataset, with a different \u001bchosen using the validation set of\neach fold. On TFD, \u001bwas cross validated on each fold and mean log-likelihood on each fold were computed.\nFor MNIST we compare against other models of the real-valued (rather than binary) version of dataset.\nof the Gaussians was obtained by cross validation on the validation set. This procedure was intro-\nduced in Breuleux et al. [8] and used for various generative models for which the exact likelihood\nis not tractable [25, 3, 5]. Results are reported in Table 1. This method of estimating the likelihood\nhas somewhat high variance and does not perform well in high dimensional spaces but it is the best\nmethod available to our knowledge. Advances in generative models that can sample but not estimate\nlikelihood directly motivate further research into how to evaluate such models.\nIn Figures 2 and 3 we show samples drawn from the generator net after training. While we make no\nclaim that these samples are better than samples generated by existing methods, we believe that these\nsamples are at least competitive with the better generative models in the literature and highlight the\npotential of the adversarial framework.\na) b)\nc) d)\nFigure 2: Visualization of samples from the model.

The disadvantages are primarily that there is no explicit representation of pg(x), and thatD\nmust be synchronized well with Gduring training (in particular, Gmust not be trained too much\nwithout updating D, in order to avoid “the Helvetica scenario” in which Gcollapses too many values\nofzto the same value of xto have enough diversity to model pdata), much as the negative chains of a\nBoltzmann machine must be kept up to date between learning steps. The advantages are that Markov\nchains are never needed, only backprop is used to obtain gradients, no inference is needed during\nlearning, and a wide variety of functions can be incorporated into the model. Table 2 summarizes\nthe comparison of generative adversarial nets with other generative modeling approaches.\nThe aforementioned advantages are primarily computational. Adversarial models may also gain\nsome statistical advantage from the generator network not being updated directly with data exam-\nples, but only with gradients ﬂowing through the discriminator. This means that components of the\ninput are not copied directly into the generator’s parameters. Another advantage of adversarial net-\nworks is that they can represent very sharp, even degenerate distributions, while methods based on\nMarkov chains require that the distribution be somewhat blurry in order for the chains to be able to\nmix between modes.\n7 Conclusions and future work\nThis framework admits many straightforward extensions:\n1. A conditional generative modelp(xjc)can be obtained by adding cas input to both GandD.\n2.Learned approximate inference can be performed by training an auxiliary network to predict z\ngiven x. This is similar to the inference net trained by the wake-sleep algorithm [15] but with\nthe advantage that the inference net may be trained for a ﬁxed generator net after the generator\nnet has ﬁnished training.\n7\n3. One can approximately model all conditionals p(xSjx6S)whereSis a subset of the indices\nofxby training a family of conditional models that share parameters. Essentially, one can use\nadversarial nets to implement a stochastic extension of the deterministic MP-DBM [11].\n4.Semi-supervised learning : features from the discriminator or inference net could improve perfor-\nmance of classiﬁers when limited labeled data is available.\n5.Efﬁciency improvements: training could be accelerated greatly by divising better methods for\ncoordinating GandDor determining better distributions to sample zfrom during training.\nThis paper has demonstrated the viability of the adversarial modeling framework, suggesting that\nthese research directions could prove useful.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to acknowledge Patrice Marcotte, Olivier Delalleau, Kyunghyun Cho, Guillaume\nAlain and Jason Yosinski for helpful discussions.

  "normalized_text": "generative adversarial nets ian j. goodfellow, jean pouget-abadie\u0003, mehdi mirza, bing xu, david warde-farley, sherjil ozairy, aaron courville, yoshua bengioz d ́epartement d’informatique et de recherche op ́erationnelle universit ́e de montr ́eal montr ́eal, qc h3c 3j7 abstract we propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model g that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model dthat estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than g. the training procedure for gis to maximize the probability of dmaking a mistake. this framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. in the space of arbitrary functionsgandd, a unique solution exists, with grecovering the training data distribution and dequal to1 2everywhere. in the case where ganddare defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. there is no need for any markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples. 1 introduction the promise of deep learning is to discover rich, hierarchical models [2] that represent probability distributions over the kinds of data encountered in artificial intelligence applications, such as natural images, audio waveforms containing speech, and symbols in natural language corpora. so far, the most striking successes in deep learning have involved discriminative models, usually those that map a high-dimensional, rich sensory input to a class label [14, 22]. these striking successes have primarily been based on the backpropagation and dropout algorithms, using piecewise linear units [19, 9, 10] which have a particularly well-behaved gradient . deep generative models have had less of an impact, due to the difficulty of approximating many intractable probabilistic computations that arise in maximum likelihood estimation and related strategies, and due to difficulty of leveraging the benefits of piecewise linear units in the generative context. we propose a new generative model estimation procedure that sidesteps these difficulties.1 in the proposed adversarial nets framework, the generative model is pitted against an adversary: a discriminative model that learns to determine whether a sample is from the model distribution or the data distribution. the generative model can be thought of as analogous to a team of counterfeiters, trying to produce fake currency and use it without detection, while the discriminative model is analogous to the police, trying to detect the counterfeit currency. competition in this game drives both teams to improve their methods until the counterfeits are indistiguishable from the genuine articles. \u0003jean pouget-abadie is visiting

and hyperparameters available at http://www.github.com/goodfeli/adversarial 1arxiv:1406.2661v1 [stat.ml] 10 jun 2014 this framework can yield specific training algorithms for many kinds of model and optimization algorithm. in this article, we explore the special case when the generative model generates samples by passing random noise through a multilayer perceptron, and the discriminative model is also a multilayer perceptron. we refer to this special case as adversarial nets . in this case, we can train both models using only the highly successful backpropagation and dropout algorithms [17] and sample from the generative model using only forward propagation. no approximate inference or markov chains are necessary. 2 related work an alternative to directed graphical models with latent variables are undirected graphical models with latent variables, such as restricted boltzmann machines (rbms) [27, 16], deep boltzmann machines (dbms) [26] and their numerous variants. the interactions within such models are represented as the product of unnormalized potential functions, normalized by a global summation/integration over all states of the random variables. this quantity (the partition function ) and its gradient are intractable for all but the most trivial instances, although they can be estimated by markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) methods. mixing poses a significant problem for learning algorithms that rely on mcmc [3, 5]. deep belief networks (dbns) [16] are hybrid models containing a single undirected layer and several directed layers. while a fast approximate layer-wise training criterion exists, dbns incur the computational difficulties associated with both undirected and directed models. alternative criteria that do not approximate or bound the log-likelihood have also been proposed, such as score matching [18] and noise-contrastive estimation (nce) [13]. both of these require the learned probability density to be analytically specified up to a normalization constant. note that in many interesting generative models with several layers of latent variables (such as dbns and dbms), it is not even possible to derive a tractable unnormalized probability density. some models such as denoising auto-encoders [30] and contractive autoencoders have learning rules very similar to score matching applied to rbms. in nce, as in this work, a discriminative training criterion is employed to fit a generative model. however, rather than fitting a separate discriminative model, the generative model itself is used to discriminate generated data from samples a fixed noise distribution. because nce uses a fixed noise distribution, learning slows dramatically after the model has learned even an approximately correct distribution over a small subset of the observed variables. finally, some techniques do not involve defining a probability distribution explicitly, but rather train a generative machine to draw samples from the desired distribution. this approach has the advantage that such machines can be designed to be trained by back-propagation. prominent recent work in this area includes the generative stochastic network (gsn) framework [5], which extends generalized denoising auto-encoders [4]: both can be seen as defining a parameterized markov chain, i.e., one learns the parameters of a machine that performs one step of a generative markov chain. compared to gsns, the adversarial nets framework does not require a markov chain for sampling. because adversarial nets do not require feedback loops during generation, they are better able to leverage piecewise linear units [19, 9, 10], which improve the performance of backpropagation but have problems with unbounded activation when used ina feedback loop. more recent examples of training a generative machine by back-propagating into it include recent work on auto-encoding variational bayes [20] and stochastic backpropagation [24]. 3 adversarial nets the adversarial modeling framework is most straightforward to apply when the models are both multilayer perceptrons. to learn the generator’s distribution pgover data x, we define a prior on input noise variables pz(z), then represent a mapping to data space as g(z;\u0012g), wheregis a differentiable function represented by a multilayer perceptron with parameters \u0012g. we also define a second multilayer perceptron d(x;\u0012d)that outputs a single scalar. d(x)represents the probability thatxcame from the data rather than pg. we traindto maximize the probability of assigning the correct label to both training examples and samples from g. we simultaneously train gto minimize log(1\u0000d(g(z))): 2 in other words, dandgplay the following two-player minimax game with value function v(g;d ): min gmax dv(d;g ) =ex\u0018pdata(x)[logd(x)] +ez\u0018pz(z)[log(1\u0000d(g(z)))]: (1) in the next section, we present a theoretical analysis of adversarial nets, essentially showing that the training criterion allows one to recover the data generating distribution as ganddare given enough capacity, i.e., in the non-parametric limit. see figure 1 for a less formal, more pedagogical explanation of the approach. in practice, we must implement the game using an iterative, numerical approach. optimizing dto completion in the inner loop of training is computationally prohibitive, and on finite datasets would result in overfitting. instead, we alternate between ksteps of optimizing dand one step of optimizing g. this results in dbeing maintained near its optimal solution, so long asgchanges slowly enough. this strategy is analogous to the way that sml/pcd [31, 29] training maintains samples from a markov chain from one learning step to the next in order to avoid burning in a markov chain as part of the inner loop of learning. the procedure is formally presented in algorithm 1. in practice, equation 1 may not provide sufficient gradient for gto learn well. early in learning, whengis poor,dcan reject samples with high confidence because they are clearly different from the training data. in this case, log(1\u0000d(g(z)))saturates. rather than training gto minimize log(1\u0000d(g(z)))we can train gto maximize logd(g(z)). this objective function results in the same fixed point of the dynamics of ganddbut provides much stronger gradients early in learning. x z x z

(d) after several steps of training, if ganddhave enough capacity, they will reach a point at which both cannot improve because pg=pdata. the discriminator is unable to differentiate between the two distributions, i.e. d(x) =1 2. 4 theoretical results the generator gimplicitly defines a probability distribution pgas the distribution of the samples g(z)obtained when z\u0018pz. therefore, we would like algorithm 1 to converge to a good estimator ofpdata, if given enough capacity and training time. the results of this section are done in a nonparametric setting, e.g. we represent a model with infinite capacity by studying convergence in the space of probability density functions. we will show in section 4.1 that this minimax game has a global optimum for pg=pdata. we will then show in section 4.2 that algorithm 1 optimizes eq 1, thus obtaining the desired result. 3 algorithm 1 minibatch stochastic gradient descent training of generative adversarial nets. the number of steps to

gradient-based learning rule. we used momentum in our experiments. 4.1 global optimality of pg=pdata we first consider the optimal discriminator dfor any given generator g. proposition 1. forgfixed, the optimal discriminator dis d\u0003 g(x) =pdata(x) pdata(x) +pg(x)(2) proof. the training criterion for the discriminator d, given any generator g, is to maximize the quantityv(g;d ) v(g;d ) =z xpdata(x) log(d(x))dx+z zpz(z) log(1\u0000d(g(z)))dz =z xpdata(x) log(d(x)) +pg(x) log(1\u0000d(x))dx (3) for any (a;b)2r2nf0;0g, the function y!alog(y) +blog(1\u0000y)achieves its maximum in [0;1]ata a+b. the discriminator does not need to be defined outside of supp (pdata)[supp (pg), concluding the proof. note that the training objective for dcan be interpreted as maximizing the log-likelihood for estimating the conditional probability p(y=yjx), whereyindicates whether xcomes from pdata (withy= 1) or frompg(withy= 0). the minimax game in eq. 1 can now be reformulated as: c(g) = max dv(g;d ) =ex\u0018pdata[logd\u0003 g(x)] +ez\u0018pz[log(1\u0000d\u0003 g(g(z)))] (4) =ex\u0018pdata[logd\u0003 g(x)] +ex\u0018pg[log(1\u0000d\u0003 g(x))] =ex\u0018pdata\u0014 logpdata(x) pdata(x) +pg(x)\u0015 +ex\u0018pg\u0014 logpg(x) pdata(x) +pg(x)\u0015 4 theorem 1. the global minimum of the virtual training criterion c(g)is achieved if and only if pg=pdata. at that point, c(g)achieves the value \u0000log 4 . proof. forpg=pdata,d\u0003 g(x) =1 2, (consider eq. 2). hence, by inspecting eq. 4 at d\u0003 g(x) =1 2, we findc(g) = log1 2+ log1 2=\u0000log 4 . to see that this is the best possible value of c(g), reached only forpg=pdata, observe that ex\u0018pdata[\u0000log 2] + ex\u0018pg[\u0000log 2] =\u0000log 4 and that by subtracting this expression from c(g) =v(d\u0003 g;g), we obtain: c(g) =\u0000log(4) +kl\u0012 pdata pdata+pg 2\u0013 +kl\u0012 pg pdata+pg 2\u0013 (5) where kl is the kullback–leibler divergence. we recognize in the previous expression the jensen– shannon divergence between the model’s distribution and the data generating process: c(g) =\u0000log(4) + 2\u0001jsd (pdatakpg) (6) since the jensen–shannon divergence between two distributions is always non-negative and zero only when they are equal, we have shown that c\u0003=\u0000log(4) is the global minimum of c(g)and that the only solution is pg=pdata, i.e., the generative model perfectly replicating the data generating process. 4.2 convergence of algorithm 1 proposition 2. ifganddhave enough capacity, and at each step of algorithm 1, the discriminator is allowed to reach its optimum given g, andpgis updated so as to improve the criterion ex\u0018pdata[logd\u0003 g(x)] +ex\u0018pg[log(1\u0000d\u0003 g(x))] thenpgconverges to pdata proof. considerv(g;d ) =u(pg;d)as a function of pgas done in the above criterion. note thatu(pg;d)is convex in pg. the subderivatives of a supremum of convex functions include the derivative of the function at the point where the maximum is attained. in other words, if f(x) = sup 2af (x)andf (x)is convex in xfor every , then@f (x)2@fif = arg sup 2af (x). this is equivalent to computing a gradient descent update for pgat the optimal dgiven the correspondingg.supdu(pg;d)is convex in pgwith a unique global optima as proven in thm 1, therefore with sufficiently small updates of pg,pgconverges to px, concluding the proof. in practice, adversarial nets represent a limited family of pgdistributions via the function g(z;\u0012g), and we optimize \u0012grather thanpgitself. using a multilayer perceptron to define gintroduces multiple critical points in parameter space. however, the excellent performance of multilayer perceptrons in practice suggests that they are a reasonable model to use despite their lack of theoretical guarantees. 5 experiments we trained adversarial nets an a range of datasets including mnist[23], the toronto face database (tfd) [28], and cifar-10 [21]. the generator nets used a mixture of rectifier linear activations [19, 9] and sigmoid activations, while the discriminator net used maxout [10] activations. dropout [17] was applied in training the discriminator net. while our theoretical framework permits the use of dropout and other noise at intermediate layers of the generator, we used noise as the input to only the bottommost layer of the generator network. we estimate probability of the test set data under pgby fitting a gaussian parzen window to the samples generated with gand reporting the log-likelihood under this distribution. the \u001bparameter 5 model mnist

estimates. the reported numbers on mnist are the mean loglikelihood of samples on test set, with the standard error of the mean computed across examples. on tfd, we computed the standard error across folds of the dataset, with a different \u001bchosen using the validation set of each fold. on tfd, \u001bwas cross validated on each fold and mean log-likelihood on each fold were computed. for mnist we compare against other models of the real-valued (rather than binary) version of dataset. of the gaussians was obtained by cross validation on the validation set. this procedure was introduced in breuleux et al. [8] and used for various generative models for which the exact likelihood is not tractable [25, 3, 5]. results are reported in table 1. this method of estimating the likelihood has somewhat high variance and does not perform well in high dimensional spaces but it is the best method available to our knowledge. advances in generative models that can sample but not estimate likelihood directly motivate further research into how to evaluate such models. in figures 2 and 3 we show samples drawn from the generator net after training. while we make no claim that these samples are better than samples generated by existing methods, we believe that these samples are at least competitive with the better generative models in the literature and highlight the potential of the adversarial framework. a) b) c) d) figure 2: visualization of samples from the model. rightmost column shows the nearest training example of the neighboring sample, in order to demonstrate that the model has not

operations involving a model. 6 advantages and disadvantages this new framework comes with advantages and disadvantages relative to previous modeling frameworks. the disadvantages are primarily that there is no explicit representation of pg(x), and thatd must be synchronized well with gduring training (in particular, gmust not be trained too much without updating d, in order to avoid “the helvetica scenario” in which gcollapses too many values ofzto the same value of xto have enough diversity to model pdata), much as the negative chains of a boltzmann machine must be kept up to date between learning steps. the advantages are that markov chains are never needed, only backprop is used to obtain gradients, no inference is needed during learning, and a wide variety of functions can be incorporated into the model. table 2 summarizes the comparison of generative adversarial nets with other generative modeling approaches. the aforementioned advantages are primarily computational. adversarial models may also gain some statistical advantage from the generator network not being updated directly with data examples, but only with gradients flowing through the discriminator. this means that components of the input are not copied directly into the generator’s parameters. another advantage of adversarial networks is that they can represent very sharp, even degenerate distributions, while methods based on markov chains require that the distribution be somewhat blurry in order for the chains to be able to mix between modes. 7 conclusions and future work this framework admits many straightforward extensions: 1. a conditional generative modelp(xjc)can be obtained by adding cas input to both gandd. 2.learned approximate inference can be performed by training an auxiliary network to predict z given x. this is similar to the inference net trained by the wake-sleep algorithm [15] but with the advantage that the inference net may be trained for a fixed generator net after the generator net has finished training. 7 3. one can approximately model all conditionals p(xsjx6s)wheresis a subset of the indices ofxby training a family of conditional models that share parameters. essentially, one can use adversarial nets to implement a stochastic extension of the deterministic mp-dbm [11]. 4.semi-supervised learning : features from the discriminator or inference net could improve performance of classifiers when limited labeled data is available. 5.efficiency improvements: training could be accelerated greatly by divising better methods for coordinating ganddor determining better distributions to sample zfrom during training. this paper has demonstrated the viability of the adversarial modeling framework, suggesting that these research directions could prove useful. acknowledgments we would like to acknowledge patrice marcotte, olivier delalleau, kyunghyun cho, guillaume alain and jason yosinski for helpful discussions. yann dauphin
