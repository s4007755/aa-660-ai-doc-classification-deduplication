  "raw_text": "arXiv:1607.03591v2  [math.PR]  7 Sep 2016Analysis and Probability on Inﬁnite-Dimensional Spaces\nNathaniel Eldredge\nSeptember 8, 2016\nPreface\nI wrote these lecture notes for a graduate topics course I tau ght at Cornell University in Fall 2011\n(Math 7770). The ostensible primary goal of the course was fo r the students to learn some of\nthe fundamental results and techniques in the study of proba bility on inﬁnite-dimensional spaces,\nparticularly Gaussian measures on Banach spaces (also know n as abstract Wiener spaces). As\nothers who have taught such courses will understand, a nontr ivial secondary goal of the course was\nfor the instructor (i.e., me) to do the same. These notes only scratch the very surface of the subject,\nbut I tried to use them to work through some of the basics and se e how they ﬁt together into a\nbigger picture. In addition to theorems and proofs, I’ve lef t in some more informal discussions that\nattempt to develop intuition.\nMost of the material here comes from the books [14, 16, 2], and the lecture notes prepared by\nBruce Driver for the 2010 Cornell Probability Summer School [4, 5]. If you are looking to learn\nmore, these are great places to look.1\nAny text marked Question N is something that I found myself wondering while writing thi s,\nbutdidn’tever resolve. I’mnot proposingthem as openprobl ems; theanswerscould bewell-known,\njust not by me. If you know the answer to any of them, I’d be happ y to hear about it! There are\nalso still a few places where proofs are rough or have some gap s that I never got around to ﬁlling\nin.\nOn the other hand, something marked Exercise N is really meant as an exercise.\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank the graduate st udents who attended the course.\nThese notes were much improved by their questions and contri butions. I’d also like to thank several\ncolleagues who sat in on the course or otherwise contributed to these notes, particularly Clinton\nConley, Bruce Driver, Leonard Gross, Ambar Sengupta, and Be njamin Steinhurst. Obviously, the\nmany deﬁciencies in these notes are my responsibility and no t theirs.\nQuestions and comments on these notes are most welcome. I am n ow at the University of\nNorthern Colorado, and you can email me at neldredge@unco.edu .\n1In reading these notes in conjunction with [16], you should i dentify Nualart’s abstract probability space (Ω ,F,P)\nwith our Banach space ( W,B,µ). His “Gaussian process” h/mapsto→W(h) should be viewed as corresponding to our map\nTdeﬁned in Section 4.3; his indexing Hilbert space Hmay be identiﬁed with the Cameron–Martin space, and his\nW(h) is the random variable, deﬁned on the Banach space, that we h ave denoted by Thor/angbracketlefth,·/angbracketright. There’s a general\nprinciple in this area that all the “action” takes place on th e Cameron–Martin space, so one doesn’t really lose much\nby dropping the Banach space structure on the space Wand replacing it with an generic Ω (and moreover generality\nis gained). Nonetheless, I found it helpful in building intu ition to work on a concrete space W; this also gives one\nthe opportunity to explore how the topologies of WandHinteract.\n1\n1 Introduction\n1.1 Why analysis and probability on Rnis nice\nClassically, real analysis is usually based on the study of r eal-valued functions on ﬁnite-dimensional\nEuclidean space Rn, and operations on those functions involving limits, diﬀere ntiation, and inte-\ngration. Why is Rnsuch a nice space for this theory?\n•Rnis a nice topological space, so limits behave well. Speciﬁca lly, it is a complete separable\nmetric space, and it’s locally compact.\n•Rnhas a nice algebraic structure: it’s a vector space, so trans lation and scaling make sense.\nThis is where diﬀerentiation comes in: the derivative of a fun ction just measures how it\nchanges under inﬁnitesimal translation.\n•Rnhas a natural measure space structure; namely, Lebesgue mea suremon the Borel σ-\nalgebra. The most important property of Lebesgue measure is that it is invariant under\ntranslation. This leads to nice interactions between diﬀere ntiation and integration, such as\nintegration by parts, and it gives nice functional-analyti c properties to diﬀerentiation opera-\ntors: for instance, the Laplacian ∆ is a self-adjoint operat or on the Hilbert space L2(Rn,m).\nOf course, a lot of analysis only involves local properties, and so it can be done on spaces that\nare locally like Rn: e.g. manifolds. Let’s set this idea aside for now.\n1.2 Why inﬁnite-dimensional spaces might be less nice\nThe fundamental idea in this course will be: how can we do anal ysis when we replace Rnby an\ninﬁnite dimensional space? First we should ask: what sort of space should we use? Separable\nBanach spaces seem to be nice. They have a nice topology (comp lete separable metric spaces) and\nare vector spaces. But what’s missing is Lebesgue measure. S peciﬁcally:\nTheorem 1.1. “There is no inﬁnite-dimensional Lebesgue measure.” Let Wbe an inﬁnite-\ndimensional separable Banach space. There does not exist a tr anslation-invariant Borel measure\nonWwhich assigns positive ﬁnite measure to open balls. In fact, a ny translation-invariant Borel\nmeasuremonWis either the zero measure or assigns inﬁnite measure to ever y open set.\nProof.Essentially, the problem is that inside any ball B(x,r), one can ﬁnd inﬁnitely many disjoint\nballsB(xi,s) of some ﬁxed smaller radius s. By translation invariance, all the B(xi,s) have the\nsame measure. If that measure is positive, then m(B(x,r)) =∞. If that measure is zero, then we\nobserve that Wcan be covered by countably many balls of radius s(by separability) and so mis\nthe zero measure.\nThe ﬁrst sentence is essentially Riesz’s lemma: given any pr oper closed subspace E, one can\nﬁnd a point xwith||x|| ≤1 andd(x,E)>1/2. (Start by picking any y /∈E, so thatd(y,E)>0;\nthen by deﬁnition there is an z∈Ewithd(y,z)<2d(y,E). Now look at y−zand rescale as\nneeded.) Now let’s look at B(0,2) for concreteness. Construct x1,x2,...inductively by letting\nEn= span{x1,...,x n}(which is closed) and choosing xn+1as in Riesz’s lemma with ||xn+1|| ≤1\nandd(xn+1,En)>1/2. In particular, d(xn+1,xi)>1/2 fori≤n. Since our space is inﬁnite\ndimensional, the ﬁnite-dimensional subspaces Enare always proper and the induction can continue,\nproducing a sequence {xi}withd(xi,xj)>1/2 fori/\\e}atio\\slash=j, and thus the balls B(xi,1/4) are pairwise\ndisjoint.\n2\nExercise 1.2. Prove the above theorem for Wan inﬁnite-dimensional Hausdorﬀ topological vector\nspace. (Do we need separability?)\nA more intuitive idea why inﬁnite-dimensional Lebesgue mea sure can’t exist comes from con-\nsidering the eﬀect of scaling. In Rn, the measure of B(0,2) is 2ntimes larger than B(0,1). When\nn=∞this suggests that one cannot get sensible numbers for the me asures of balls.\nThere are nontrivial translation-invariant Borel measure s on inﬁnite-dimensional spaces: for\ninstance, counting measure. But these measures are useless for analysis since they cannot say\nanything helpful about open sets.\nSo we are going to have to give up on translation invariance, a t least for now. Later, as it turns\nout, we will study some measures that recover a little bit of t his: they are quasi-invariant under\nsometranslations. This will be explained in due course.\n1.3 Probability measures in inﬁnite dimensions\nIf we just wanted to think about Borel measures on inﬁnite-di mensional topological vector spaces,\nwe actually have lots of examples from probability, that we d eal with every day.\nExample 1.3. Let (Ω,F,P) be a probability space and X1,X2,...a sequence of random variables.\nConsider the inﬁnite product space R∞, thought of as the space of all sequences {x(i)}∞\ni=1of real\nnumbers. This is a topological vector space whenequippedwi th its producttopology. We can equip\nR∞with its Borel σ-algebra, which is the same as the product Borel σ-algebra (verify). Then the\nmap from Ω to R∞which sends ωto the sequence x(i) =Xi(ω) is measurable. The pushforward\nofPunder this map gives a Borel probability measure µonR∞.\nThe Kolmogorov extension theorem guarantees lots of choice s for the joint distribution of the\nXi, and hence lots of probability measures µ. Perhaps the simplest interesting case is when the Xi\nare iid with distribution ν, in which case µis the inﬁnite product measure µ=/producttext∞\ni=1ν. Note that\nin general one can only take the inﬁnite product of probability measures (essentially because the\nonly number awith 0</producttext∞\ni=1a<∞isa= 1).\nExample 1.4. Let (Ω,F,P) bea probability space, and {Xt: 0≤t≤1}beany stochastic process.\nWe could play the same game as before, getting a probability m easure on R[0,1](with its product\nσ-algebra). This case is not as pleasant because nothing is co untable. In particular, the Borel\nσ-algebra generated by the product topology is not the same as the product σ-algebra (exercise:\nverify this, perhaps by showing that the latter does not cont ain singleton sets.) Also, the product\ntopology on R[0,1]is rather nasty; for example it is not ﬁrst countable. (In con trast,R∞with its\nproduct topology is actually a Polish space.) So we will avoi d examples like this one.\nExample 1.5. As before, but now assume {Xt: 0≤t≤1}is acontinuous stochastic process. We\ncan then map Ω into the Banach space C([0,1]) in the natural way, by sending ωto the continuous\nfunctionX·(ω). One can check that this map is measurable when C([0,1]) is equipped with its\nBorelσ-algebra. (Hint: ||x|| ≤1 if and only if |x(t)| ≤1 for alltin a countable dense subset of\n[0,1].) So by pushing forward Pwe get a Borel probability measure on C([0,1]). For example, if\nXtis Brownian motion, this is the classical Wiener measure.\nSo probability measures seem more promising. We are going to concentrate on Gaussian prob-\nability measures. Let’s start by looking at them in ﬁnite dim ensions.\n3\n1.4 Gaussian measures in ﬁnite dimensions\nIn one dimension everyone knows what Gaussian means. We are g oing to require our measures /\nrandom variables to be centered (mean zero) to have fewer let ters ﬂoating around. However we are\ngoing to include the degenerate case of zero variance.\nDeﬁnition 1.6. A Borel probability measure µonRisGaussian with variance σ2iﬀ\nµ(B) =/integraldisplay\nB1√\n2πσe−x2/2σ2dx\nfor all Borel sets B⊂R. We also want to allow the case σ= 0, which corresponds to µ=δ0being\na Dirac mass at 0.\nWe could also specify µin terms of its Fourier transform (or characteristic functi on). The above\ncondition is equivalent to having /integraldisplay\nReiλxµ(dx) =e−σ2λ2/2\nfor allλ∈R. (Noteσ= 0 is naturally included in this formulation.)\nA random variable Xon some probability space (Ω ,F,P) is Gaussian with variance σ2if its\ndistribution measure is Gaussian, i.e.\nP(X∈B) =/integraldisplay\nB1√\n2πσe−x2/2σ2dx.\nfor all Borel sets B. Forσ= 0 we have the constant random variable X= 0. Equivalently\nE[eiλX] =e−σ2λ2/2\nfor allλ∈R.\nLet’s make a trivial observation: µis not translation invariant. However, translation doesn’ t\nmess it up completely.\nNotation 1.7. Letµbeameasureon avector space W. Fory∈W, wedenoteby µythetranslated\nmeasure deﬁned by µy(A) =µ(A−y). In other words,/integraltext\nWf(x)µy(dx) =/integraltext\nWf(x+y).\nExercise 1.8. Check that I didn’t screw up the signs in the previous paragra ph.\nDeﬁnition 1.9. A measureµon a vector space Wis said to be quasi-invariant under translation\nbyy∈Wif the measures µ,µyare mutually absolutely continuous (or equivalent ); that is, if\nµ(A) = 0⇔µy(A) = 0 for measurable sets A⊂W.\nIntuitively, quasi-invariance means that translation can change the measure of a set, but it\ndoesn’t change whether or not the measure is zero.\nOne way I like to think about equivalent measures is with the f ollowing baby example. Suppose\nI have two dice which look identical on the surface, but one of them is fair, and the other produces\nnumbers according to the distribution (0 .1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.5) (i.e. it comes up 6 half the time).\n(Note that they induceequivalent measures on {1,2,3,4,5,6}: in both cases theonly set of measure\nzero is the empty set.) I pick one of the dice and ask you to dete rmine which one it is. If you roll\na lot of 6s, you will have a strong suspicion that it’s the unfa ir die, but you can’t absolutely rule\nout the possibility that it’s the fair die and you are just unl ucky.\n4\nOn the other hand, suppose one of my dice always comes up even, and the other always comes\nup odd. In this case the induced measures are mutually singul ar: there is a set (namely {1,3,5})\nto which one gives measure 0 and the other gives measure 1. If I give you one of these dice, then all\nyou have to do is roll it once and see whether the number is even or odd, and you can be (almost)\nsure which die you have.\nFor Gaussian measures on R, note that if σ/\\e}atio\\slash= 0, thenµis quasi-invariant under translation by\nanyy∈R. This is a trivial fact: both µandµyhave positive densities with respect to Lebesgue\nmeasurem, soµ(A) = 0 iﬀµy(A) = 0 iﬀm(A) = 0. We’ll also note that, as absolutely continuous\nmeasures, they have a Radon-Nikodym derivative, which we ca n compute just by dividing the\ndensities:\ndµy\ndµ(x) =1√\n2πσe−(x−y)2/2σ\n1√\n2πσe−x2/2σ2\n=e−y2\n2σ2+xy\nσ2.\nJust pay attention to the form of this expression, as we will s ee it again later.\nOn theother hand, in the degenerate case σ= 0, thenµ=δ0andµy=δyare mutually singular.\nNow let’s look at the n-dimensional case.\nDeﬁnition 1.10. Ann-dimensional random vector X= (X1,...,X n) isGaussian if and only if\nλ·X:=/summationtextλiXiis a Gaussian random variable for all λ= (λ1,...,λ n)∈Rn.\nOr in terms of measures:\nDeﬁnition 1.11. Letµbe a Borel probability measure on Rn. For each λ∈Rn, we can think\nof the map Rn∋x/ma√sto→λ·x∈Ras a random variable on the probability space ( Rn,BRn,µ).µis\nGaussian if and only if this random variable is Gaussian for each λ.\nOf course, we know that the distribution of Xis uniquely determined by its n×ncovariance\nmatrix Σ, where Σ ij= Cov(Xi,Xj). Note that Σ is clearly symmetric and positive semideﬁnite .\nFurthermore, any symmetric, positive semideﬁnite matrix Σ can arise as a covariance matrix: let\nZ= (Z1,...,Z n) whereZiare iid Gaussian with variance 1, and set X= Σ1/2Z.\nA consequence of this is that if ( X1,...,X n) has a joint Gaussian distribution, then the Xiare\nindependent if and only if they are uncorrelated (i.e. Cov( Xi,Xj) = 0 fori/\\e}atio\\slash=j, i.e. Σ is diagonal).\nNote that this failsif all we know is that each Xihas a Gaussian distribution.\nProposition 1.12. X is Gaussian if and only if it has characteristic function\nE[eiλ·X] =e−1\n2λ·Σλ\nwhereΣis the covariance matrix of X.\nOr, in terms of measures:\nProposition 1.13. A probability measure µonRnis Gaussian if and only if\n/integraldisplay\nRneiλ·xµ(dx) =e−1\n2λ·Σλ\nfor somen×nmatrixΣ, which is necessarily positive semideﬁnite and can be chose n symmetric.\n5\nWe would like to work more abstractly and basis-free, in prep aration for the move to inﬁnite\ndimensions. The map x/ma√sto→λ·xis really just a linear functional on Rn. So let’s write:\nDeﬁnition 1.14. Letµbe a Borel probability measure on a ﬁnite-dimensional topol ogical vector\nspaceW. Then each f∈W∗can be seen as a random variable on the probability space ( W,BW,µ).\nµisGaussian if and only if, for each f∈W∗, this random variable is Gaussian.\nEquivalently, µis Gaussian iﬀ the pushforward µ◦f−1is a Gaussian measure on Rfor each\nf∈W∗.\nOf course we have not done anything here because a ﬁnite-dime nsional topological vector space\nWisjustsome Rnwithitsusualtopology. Everylinearfunctional f∈W∗isoftheform f(x) =λ·x,\nand all such linear functionals are continuous, hence measu rable.\nIff,g∈W∗are thought of as Gaussian random variables on ( W,µ), thenq(f,g) = Cov(f,g) is\na symmetric, positive semideﬁnite, bilinear form on W∗. We’ll also write q(f) =q(f,f) = Var(f).\nqis the basis-free analogue of the covariance matrix; we coul d call it the covariance form. As we\nargued above, in this ﬁnite-dimensional case, any such bili near form can arise as a covariance form.\nAnother way to think about this is that since each f∈W∗is Gaussian, it is certainly square-\nintegrable, i.e./integraltext\nW|f(x)|2µ(dx) =E|f|2= Var(f)<∞. SoV∗can be thought of as a subspace of\nL2(V,µ). Thenqis nothing but the restriction of the L2inner product to the subspace W∗.\n(Technically, qmay be degenerate, in which case it is actually the quotient o fW∗by the kernel\nofqthat we identify as a subspace of L2(W,µ).)\nExercise 1.15. The support of the measure µis given by\nsuppµ=/intersectiondisplay\nq(f,f)=0kerf.\nOne could write supp µ= (kerq)⊥. In particular, if qis positive deﬁnite, then µhas full support.\n(Recall that the support of a measure µis deﬁned as the smallest closed set with full measure.)\nExercise 1.16. The restriction of µto its support is a nondegenerate Gaussian measure (i.e. the\ncovariance form is positive deﬁnite).\nExercise 1.17. µis quasi-invariant under translation by yif and only if y∈suppµ. Ify /∈suppµ,\nthenµandµyare mutually singular. (We’ll see that in inﬁnite dimension s, the situation is more\ncomplex.)\nIn terms of characteristic functions, then, we have\nProposition 1.18. A Borel probability measure µon a ﬁnite-dimensional topological vector space\nWis Gaussian if and only if, for each f∈W∗, we have\n/integraldisplay\nWeif(x)µ(dx) =e−1\n2q(f,f)\nwhereqis some positive semideﬁnite symmetric bilinear form on W∗.\n6\n2 Inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian measures\nDeﬁnition 1.14 will generalize pretty immediately to inﬁni te-dimensional topological vector spaces.\nThere is just one problem. An arbitrary linear functional on a topological vector space can be\nnasty; in particular, it need not be Borel measurable, in whi ch case it doesn’t represent a random\nvariable. But continuous linear functionals are much nicer , and are Borel measurable for sure, so\nwe’ll restrict our attention to them.2\nAs usual,W∗will denote the continuous dual of W.\nDeﬁnition 2.1. LetWbe a topological vector space, and µa Borel probability measure on W.\nµisGaussian iﬀ, for each continuous linear functional f∈W∗, the pushforward µ◦f−1is a\nGaussian measure on R, i.e.fis a Gaussian random variable on ( W,BW,µ).\nAs before, we get a covariance form qonW∗whereq(f,g) = Cov(f,g). Again,W∗can be\nidentiﬁed as a subspace of L2(W,µ), andqis the restriction of the L2inner product.\nProposition 2.2. A Borel probability measure µon a topological vector space Wis Gaussian if\nand only if, for each f∈W∗, we have\n/integraldisplay\nWeif(x)µ(dx) =e−1\n2q(f,f)\nwhereqis some positive semideﬁnite symmetric bilinear form on W∗.\nExercise 2.3. Iff1,...,fninW∗, then (f1,...,fn) has a joint Gaussian distribution.\nExercise 2.4. Anyq-orthogonal subset of W∗is an independent set of random variables on ( W,µ).\nFor the most part, we will concentrate on the case that Wis a separable Banach space. But\nas motivation, we ﬁrst want to look at a single case where it is n’t. If you want more detail on the\ngeneral theory for topological vector spaces, see Bogachev [2].\n3 Motivating example: R∞with product Gaussian measure\nAs in Example 1.3, let’s take W=R∞with its product topology. Let’s record some basic facts\nabout this topological vector space.\nExercise 3.1. Wis a Fr´ echet space (its topology is generated by a countable family of seminorms).\nExercise 3.2. Wis a Polish space. (So we are justiﬁed in doing all our topolog ical arguments\nwith sequences.)\nExercise 3.3. The topology of Wdoes not come from any norm.\nExercise 3.4. The Borelσ-algebra of Wis the same as the product σ-algebra.\n2In the case of separable Banach spaces, or more generally Pol ish topological vector spaces, this suﬃcient condition\nis also necessary: a linear functional is Borel measurable i f and only if it is continuous. Even the weaker assumption\nof so-called Baire measurability is suﬃcient, in fact. See 9 .C of [13]. So we are not giving up anything by requiring\ncontinuity. Thanks to Clinton Conley for explaining this to me and providing a reference. This sort of goes to show\nthat a linear functional on a separable Banach space is eithe r continuous or really really nasty.\n7\nExercise 3.5. Every continuous linear functional f∈W∗is of the form\nf(x) =n/summationdisplay\ni=1aix(i)\nfor somea1,...,a n∈R. ThusW∗can be identiﬁed with c00, the set of all real sequences which\nare eventually zero.\nLet’s write eifor the element of Wwithei(j) =δij, andπifor the projection onto the i’th\ncoordinate πi(x) =x(i). (Noteπi∈W∗; indeed they form a basis.)\nAs in Example 1.3, we choose µto be an inﬁnite product of Gaussian measures with variance\n1. Equivalently, µis the distribution of an iid sequence of standard Gaussian r andom variables. So\nthe random variables πiare iid standard Gaussian.\nExercise 3.6. µis a Gaussian measure. The covariance form of µis given by\nq(f,g) =∞/summationdisplay\ni=1f(ei)g(ei).\n(Note that the sum is actually ﬁnite.)\nExercise 3.7. µhas full support.\nqis actually positive deﬁnite: the only f∈W∗withq(f,f) = 0 isf= 0. SoW∗is an honest\nsubspace of L2(W,µ). It is not a closed subspace, though; that is, W∗is not complete in the q\ninner product. Let Kdenote the L2(W,µ)-closure of W∗.\nExercise 3.8. Show thatKconsists of all functions f:W→Rof the form\nf(x) =∞/summationdisplay\ni=1aix(i) (3.1)\nwhere/summationtext∞\ni=1|ai|2<∞. This formula requires some explanation. For an arbitrary x∈W, the sum\nin (3.1) may not converge. However, show that it does converg e forµ-a.e.x∈W. (Hint: Sums of\nindependent random variables converge a.s. as soon as they c onverge inL2; see Theorem 2.5.3 of\nDurrett [7].) Note well that the measure-1 set on which (3.1) converges depends on f, and there\nwill not be a single measure-1 set where convergence holds fo r everyf. Moreover, show each f∈K\nis a Gaussian random variable.\n(Kis isomorphic to ℓ2; this should make sense, since it is the completion of W∗=c00in theq\ninner product, which is really the ℓ2inner product.)\nNow let’s think about how µbehaves under translation. A ﬁrst guess, by analogy with the case\nof product Gaussian measure on Rn, is that it is quasi-invariant under all translations. But l et’s\nlook closer at the ﬁnite-dimensional case. If νis standard Gaussian measure on Rn, i.e.\ndν=1\n(2π)n/2e−|x|2/2dx\nthen a simple calculation shows\ndνy\ndν(x) =e−1\n2|y|2+x·y. (3.2)\n8\nNote that the Euclidean norm of yappears. Sending n→ ∞, the Euclidean norm becomes the ℓ2\nnorm. This suggests that ℓ2should play a special role. In particular, translation by yis not going\nto produce a reasonable positive Radon-Nikodym derivative if/ba∇dbly/ba∇dblℓ2=∞.\nLet’s denote ℓ2, considered as a subset of W, byH.Hhas a Hilbert space structure coming\nfrom theℓ2norm, which we’ll denote by /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblH. We note that, as shown in Exercise 3.8, that for\nﬁxedh∈H, (h,x)Hmakes sense not only for x∈Hbut forµ-a.e.x∈W, and (h,·)His a Gaussian\nrandom variable on ( W,µ) with variance /ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2\nH.\nTheorem 3.9 (Special case of the Cameron-Martin theorem) .Ifh∈H, thenµis quasi-invariant\nunder translation by h, and\ndµh\ndµ(x) =e−1\n2/bardblh/bardbl2\nH+(h,x)H. (3.3)\nConversely, if y /∈H, thenµ,µyare mutually singular.\nProof.We are trying to show that\nµh(B) =/integraldisplay\nBe−1\n2/bardblh/bardbl2\nH+(h,x)Hµ(dx) (3.4)\nfor all Borel sets B⊂W. It is suﬃcient to consider the case where Bis a “cylinder set” of the form\nB=B1×···×Bn×R×..., since the collection of all cylinder sets is a π-system which generates\nthe Borelσ-algebra. But this eﬀectively takes us back to the n-dimensional setting, and unwinding\nnotation will show that in this case (3.3) is the same as (3.2) .\nThis is a bit messy to write out; here is an attempt. If you don’ t like it I encourage you to try\nto just work it out yourself.\nSinceWis a product space, let us decompose it as W=Rn×R∞, writingx∈Was (xn,x∞)\nwithxn= (x(1),...,x(n)) andx∞= (x(n+ 1),...). Thenµfactors asµn×µ∞, whereµnis\nstandard Gaussian measure on Rnandµ∞is again product Gaussian measure on R∞.µhfactors\nasµn\nhn×µ∞\nh∞. Also, the integrand in (3.4) factors as\ne−1\n2|hn|2+hn·xne−1\n2||h∞||2\nℓ∞+(h∞,x∞)ℓ2.\nSo by Tonelli’s theorem the right side of (3.4) equals\n/integraldisplay\nB1×···×Bne−1\n2|hn|2+hn·xnµn(dxn)/integraldisplay\nR∞e−1\n2||h∞||2\nℓ∞+(h∞,x∞)ℓ2µ∞(dx∞).\nThe ﬁrst factor is equal to µn\nhn(B1× ··· ×Bn) as shown in (3.2). Since ( h∞,·)ℓ2is a Gaussian\nrandom variable on ( R∞,µ∞) with variance ||h∞||2\nℓ2, the second factor is of the form E[eX−σ2/2]\nforX∼N(0,σ2), which is easily computed to be 1. Since µ∞\nh∞(R∞) = 1 also (it is a probability\nmeasure), we are done with the forward direction.\nFor the converse direction, suppose h /∈H. Then, by the contrapositive of Lemma A.1, there\nexistsg∈ℓ2such that/summationtexth(i)g(i) diverges. Let A={x∈W:/summationtextx(i)g(i) converges }; this\nset is clearly Borel, and we know µ(A) = 1 by Exercise 3.8. But if/summationtextx(i)g(i) converges, then/summationtext(x−h)(i)g(i) diverges, so A−his disjoint from Aandµh(A) =µ(A−h) = 0.\nWe callHtheCameron–Martin space associated to ( W,µ).\n9\nExercise 3.10. His dense in W, and the inclusion map H ֒→Wis continuous (with respect to\ntheℓ2topology on Hand the product topology on W).\nAlthoughHis dense, there are several senses in which it is small.\nProposition 3.11. µ(H) = 0.\nProof.Forx∈W,x∈Hiﬀ/summationtext\ni|πi(x)|2<∞. Note that the πiare iidN(0,1) random variables\non (W,µ). So by the strong law of large numbers, for µ-a.e.x∈Wwe have1\nn/summationtextn\ni=1|πi(x)|2→1;\nin particular/summationtext\ni|πi(x)|2=∞.\nExercise 3.12. Any bounded subset of His precompact and nowhere dense in W. In particular,\nHis meager in W.\nSoµis quasi-invariant only under translation by elements of th e small subset H.\n4 Abstract Wiener space\nMuch of this section comes from Bruce Driver’s notes [5] and f rom Kuo’s book [14].\nDeﬁnition 4.1. Anabstract Wiener space is a pair (W,µ) consisting of a separable Banach\nspaceWand a Gaussian measure µonW.\nLater we will write an abstract Wiener space as ( W,H,µ) whereHis the Cameron–Martin\nspace. Technically this is redundant because Hwill be completely determined by Wandµ. Len\nGross’s original development [9, 10] went the other way, sta rting withHand choosing a ( W,µ) to\nmatch it, and this choice is not unique. We’ll discuss this mo re later.\nDeﬁnition 4.2. (W,µ) isnon-degenerate if the covariance form qonW∗is positive deﬁnite.\nExercise 4.3. Ifµhas full support (i.e. µ(U)>0 for every nonempty open U) then (W,µ) is\nnon-degenerate. (For the converse, see Exercise 4.25 below .)\nFrom now on, we will assume( W,µ) is non-degenerate unless otherwisespeciﬁed. (This assum p-\ntion is really harmless, as will be justiﬁed in Remark 4.26 be low.) SoW∗is honestly (injectively)\nembedded into L2(µ), andqis the restriction to W∗of theL2(µ) inner product. As before, we let\nKdenote the closure of W∗inL2(µ).\nNote that we now have two diﬀerent topologies on W∗: the operator norm topology (under\nwhich it is complete), and the topology induced by the qorL2inner product (under which, as we\nshall see, it is not complete). The interplay between them wi ll be a big part of what we do here.\n4.1 Measure-theoretic technicalities\nThe main point of this subsection is that the continuous line ar functionals f∈W∗, and other\nfunctions you can easily build from them, are the only functi ons onWthat you really have to care\nabout.\nLetBdenote the Borel σ-algebra on W.\nLemma 4.4. Letσ(W∗)be theσ-ﬁeld onWgenerated by W∗, i.e. the smallest σ-ﬁeld that makes\neveryf∈W∗measurable. Then σ(W∗) =B.\n10\nNote that the topology generated by W∗is not the same as the original topology on W; instead\nit’s the weak topology.\nProof.Since eachf∈B∗is Borel measurable, σ(W∗)⊂ Bis automatic.\nLetBbe the closed unit ball of W; we will show B∈σ(W∗). Let{xn}be a countable dense\nsubset ofW. By the Hahn-Banach theorem, for each xnthere exists fn∈W∗with||fn||W∗= 1\nandfn(xn) =||xn||. I claim that\nB=∞/intersectiondisplay\nn=1{x:|fn(x)| ≤1}. (4.1)\nThe⊂directionisclearbecausefor x∈B,|fn(x)| ≤ ||fn||·||x||=||x|| ≤1. Forthereversedirection,\nsuppose |fn(x)| ≤1 for alln. Choose a sequence xnk→x; in particular fnk(xnk) =||xnk|| → ||x||.\nBut since ||fnk||= 1, we have ||fnk(xnk)−fnk(x)|| ≤ ||xnk−x|| →0, so||x||= limfnk(xnk) =\nlimfnk(x)≤1. We have thus shown B∈σ(W∗), since the right side of (4.1) is a countable\nintersection of sets from W∗.\nIf you want to show B(y,r)∈σ(W∗), we have\nB(y,r) =∞/intersectiondisplay\nn=1{x:|fn(x)−fn(y))|<r}.\nNow note that any open subset UofWis acountable union of closed balls (by separability) so\nU∈σ(W∗) also. Thus B ⊂σ(W∗) and we are done.\nNote that we used the separability of W, but we did not assume that W∗is separable.\nExercise 4.5. IfWis not separable, Lemma 4.4 may be false. For a counterexampl e, consider\nW=ℓ2(E) for some uncountable set E. One can show that σ(W∗) consists only of sets that\ndepend on countably many coordinates. More precisely, for A⊂EletπA:ℓ2(E)→ℓ2(A) be\nthe restriction map. Show that σ(W∗) is exactly the set of all π−1\nA(B), whereAis countable and\nB⊂ℓ2(A) is Borel. In particular, σ(W∗) doesn’t contain any singletons (in fact, every nonempty\nsubset ofσ(W∗) is non-separable).\nQuestion 1. Is Lemma 4.4 alwaysfalse for non-separable W?\nFunctionals f∈W∗are good for approximation in several senses. We are just goi ng to quote\nthe following results. The proofs can be found in [5], and are mostly along the same lines that you\nprove approximation theorems in basic measure theory. For t his subsection, assume µis a Borel\nprobability measure on W(not necessarily Gaussian).\nNotation 4.6. LetFC∞\nc(W) denote the “smooth cylinder functions” on W: those functions\nF:W→Rof the form F(x) =ϕ(f1(x),...,fn(x)) for some f1,...,fn∈W∗andϕ∈C∞\nc(R).\n(Note despite the notation that Fis not compactly supported; in fact there are no nontrivial\ncontinuous functions on Wwith compact support.)\nNotation 4.7. LetTbe the “trigonometric polynomials” on W: those functions F:W→Rof\nthe formF(x) =a1eif1(x)+···+aneifn(x)fora1,...,a n∈R,f1,...,fn∈W∗.\nTheorem 4.8. FC∞\ncandTare each dense in Lp(W,µ)for any1≤p<∞.\n11\nA nice way to prove this is via Dynkin’s multiplicative syste m theorem (a functional version of\ntheπ-λtheorem).\nTheorem 4.9 (Uniqueness of the Fourier transform) .Letµ,νbe two Borel probability measures\nonW. If/integraltext\neif(x)µ(dx) =/integraltext\neif(x)ν(dx)for allf∈W∗, thenµ=ν.\nWe could think of the Fourier transform of µas the map ˆ µ:W∗→Rdeﬁned by ˆ µ(f) =/integraltext\neif(x)µ(dx). The previous theorem says that ˆ µcompletely determines µ.\n4.2 Fernique’s theorem\nTheﬁrstresultwe want to prove is Fernique’s theorem [8], wh ich in some sensesays that a Gaussian\nmeasure has Gaussian tails: the probability of a randomly sa mpled point being at least a distance t\nfrom the origin decays like e−t2. In one dimension this is easy to prove: if µis a Gaussian measure\nonRwith, say, variance 1, we have\nµ({x:|x|>t}) = 2/integraldisplay∞\nt1√\n2πe−x2/2dx\n≤2√\n2π/integraldisplay∞\ntx\nte−x2/2dx\n=2\nt√\n2πe−t2/2(4.2)\nwhere the second line uses the fact thatx\nt≥1 forx≥t, and the third line computes the integral\ndirectly.\nThis is sort of like a heat kernel estimate.\nTheorem 4.10 (Fernique [8]) .Let(W,µ)be an abstract Wiener space. There exist ǫ>0,C >0\nsuch that for all t,\nµ({x:||x||W≥t})≤Ce−ǫt2.\nThe proof is surprisingly elementary and quite ingenious.\nLet’s prove Fernique’s theorem. We follow Driver’s proof [5 , Section 43.1]. Some of the details\nwill be sketched; refer to Driver to see them ﬁlled in.\nThe key idea is that products of Gaussian measures are “rotat ion-invariant.”\nLemma 4.11. Let(W,µ)be an abstract Wiener space. Then the product measure µ2=µ×µis a\nGaussian measure on W2.\nIf you’re worried about technicalities, you can check the fo llowing:W2is a Banach space under\nthe norm ||(x,y)||W2:=||x||W+||y||W; the norm topology is the same as the product topology;\nthe Borelσ-ﬁeld onW2is the same as the product of the Borel σ-ﬁelds onW.\nProof.LetF∈(W2)∗. If we set f(x) =F(x,0),g(y) =F(0,y), we see that f,g∈W∗and\nF(x,y) =f(x)+g(y). Now when we compute the Fourier transform of F, we ﬁnd\n/integraldisplay\nW2eiλF(x,y)µ2(dx,dy) =/integraldisplay\nWeiλf(x)µ(dx)/integraldisplay\nWeiλg(y)µ(dy)\n=e−1\n2λ2(q(f,f)+q(g,g)).\n12\nProposition 4.12. Forθ∈R, deﬁne the “rotation” RθonW2by\nRθ(x,y) = (xcosθ−ysinθ,xsinθ+ycosθ).\n(We are actually only going to use Rπ/4(x,y) =1√\n2(x−y,x+y).) Ifµis Gaussian, µ2is invariant\nunderRθ.\nInvariance of µ2underRπ/4is the only hypothesis we need in order to prove Fernique’s th eorem.\nYou might think this is a very weak hypothesis, and henceFern ique’s theorem shouldapply to many\nother classes of measures. However, it can actually be shown that any measure µsatisfying this\ncondition must in fact be Gaussian, so no generality is reall y gained.\nProof.Letν=µ2◦R−1\nθ; we must show that ν=µ2. It is enough to compare their Fourier\ntransforms. Let F∈(W2)∗, soW(x,y) =f(x)+g(y), and then\n/integraldisplay\nW2ei(f(x)+g(y))ν(dx,dy) =/integraldisplay\nW2ei(f(Tx)+g(Ty))µ2(dx,dy)\n=/integraldisplay\nW2ei(cosθf(x)−sinθf(y)+sinθg(x)+cosθg(y))µ2(dx,dy)\n=/integraldisplay\nWei(cosθf(x)+sinθg(x))µ(dx)/integraldisplay\nWei(−sinθf(y)+cosθg(y))µ(dy)\n=e−1\n2(✭✭✭✭✭✭(sin2θ+cos2θ)q(f,f)+✭✭✭✭✭✭(sin2θ+cos2θ)q(g,g))\n=/integraldisplay\nW2ei(f(x)+g(y))µ2(dx,dy).\nWe can now really prove Fernique’s theorem.\nProof.In this proof we shall write µ(/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≤t) as shorthand for µ({x:/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≤t}), etc.\nLet 0≤s≤t, and consider\nµ(/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≤s)µ(/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≥t) =µ2({(x,y) :/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≤s,/ba∇dbly/ba∇dbl ≥t})\n=µ2/parenleftbigg/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble1√\n2(x−y)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble≤s,/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble1√\n2(x+y)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble≥t/parenrightbigg\nbyRπ/4invariance of µ2. Now some gymnastics with the triangle inequality shows tha t if we have/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble1√\n2(x−y)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble≤sand/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble1√\n2(x+y)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble≥t, then/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl,/ba∇dbly/ba∇dbl ≥t−s√\n2. So we have\nµ(/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≤s)µ(/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≥t)≤µ2/parenleftbigg\n/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≥t−s√\n2,/ba∇dbly/ba∇dbl ≥t−s√\n2/parenrightbigg\n=/parenleftbigg\nµ/parenleftbigg\n/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≥t−s√\n2/parenrightbigg/parenrightbigg2\n.\nIf we rearrange and let a(t) =µ(/bardblx/bardbl≥t)\nµ(/bardblx/bardbl≤s), this gives\na(t)≤a/parenleftbiggt−s√\n2/parenrightbigg2\n. (4.3)\n13\nOnce and for all, ﬁx an slarge enough that µ(/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≥s)<µ(/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≤s) (so thata(s)<1). Now we’ll\niterate (4.3). Set t0=s,tn+1=√\n2(tn+s), so that (4.3) reads a(tn+1)≤a(tn)2, which by iteration\nimpliesa(tn)≤a(s)2n.\nSincetn↑ ∞, for anyr≥swe havetn≤r≤tn+1for somen. Note that\ntn+1=sn+1/summationdisplay\nk=02k/2≤C2n/2\nsince the largest term dominates. ais decreasing so we have\na(r)≤a(tn)≤a(s)2n≤a(s)r2/C2\nso thata(r)≤e−ǫr2, takingǫ=−log(a(s))/C2. Sincea(r) =µ(/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≤s)µ(/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≥r) we are\ndone.\nCorollary 4.13. Ifǫis as provided by Fernique’s theorem, for ǫ′<ǫwe have/integraltext\nWeǫ′||x||2µ(dx)<∞.\nProof.Standard trick: for a nonnegative random variable X,EX=/integraltext∞\n0P(X >t)dt.

For anyp>0,/integraltext\nW||x||p\nWµ(dx)<∞.\nProof.tpgrows more slowly than eǫt2.\nCorollary 4.15. The inclusion W∗֒→L2(µ)is bounded. In particular, the L2norm onW∗is\nweaker than the operator norm.\nProof.Forf∈W∗,||f||2\nL2=/integraltext\nW|f(x)|2µ(dx)≤ ||f||2\nW∗/integraltext\nW||x||2µ(dx)≤C||f||2\nW∗by the previous\ncorollary.\n(This would be a good time to look at Exercises C.1–C.6 to get s ome practice working with\ndiﬀerent topologies on a set.)\nActually we can say more than the previous corollary. Recall that an operator T:X→Yon\nnormed spaces is said to be compact if it maps bounded sets to precompact sets, or equivalently\nif for every bounded sequence {xn} ⊂X, the sequence {Txn} ⊂Yhas a convergent subsequence.\nProposition 4.16. The inclusion W∗֒→L2(µ)is compact.\n14\nProof.Suppose {fn}is a bounded sequence in W∗; say/ba∇dblfn/ba∇dblW∗≤1 for alln. By Alaoglu’s theorem\nthere is a weak-* convergent subsequence fnk, which is to say that fnkconverges pointwise to some\nf∈W∗. Note also that |fnk(x)| ≤ /ba∇dblx/ba∇dblWfor allk, and/integraltext\nW/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl2\nWµ(dx)<∞as we showed. So by\ndominated convergence, fnk→finL2(W,µ), and we found an L2-convergent subsequence.\nThis fact is rather signiﬁcant: since compact maps on inﬁnit e-dimensional spaces can’t have\ncontinuous inverses, this shows that the W∗andL2topologies on W∗must be quite diﬀerent. In\nparticular:\nCorollary 4.17. W∗is not complete in the qinner product (i.e. in the L2(µ)inner product),\nexcept in the trivial case that Wis ﬁnite dimensional.\nProof.We’ve shownthe identity map ( W∗,/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblW∗)→(W∗,q) is continuous and bijective. If ( W∗,q)\nis complete, then by the open mapping theorem, this identity map is a homeomorphism, i.e. the\nW∗andqnorms are equivalent. But the identity map is also compact, w hich means that bounded\nsets, such as the unit ball, are precompact (under either top ology). This means that W∗is locally\ncompact and hence ﬁnite dimensional.\nSo the closure KofW∗inL2(W,µ) is apropersuperset of W∗.\n4.3 The Cameron–Martin space\nOur goal is to ﬁnd a Hilbert space H⊂Wwhich will play the same role that ℓ2played for R∞.\nThe key is that, for h∈H, the mapW∗∋f/ma√sto→f(h) should be continuous with respect to the q\ninner product on W∗.\nAs before, let Kbe the closure of W∗inL2(W,µ). We’ll continue to denote the covariance form\nonK(and onW∗) byq. We’ll also use mto denote the inclusion map m:W∗→K. Recall that\nwe previously argued that mis compact.\nLemma 4.18. Everyk∈Kis a Gaussian random variable on (W,µ).\nProof.SinceW∗is dense in K, there is a sequence fn∈W∗converging to kinL2(W,µ). In\nparticular, they converge in distribution. By Lemma A.3, kis Gaussian.\nDeﬁnition 4.19. TheCameron–Martin space Hof (W,µ) consists of those h∈Wsuch that\nthe evaluation functional f/ma√sto→f(h) onW∗is continuous with respect to the qinner product.\nHis obviously a vector space.\nForh∈H, the mapW∗∋f/ma√sto→f(h) extends by continuity to a continuous linear functional on\nK. SinceKis a Hilbert space this may be identiﬁed with an element of Kitself. Thus we have a\nmappingT:H→Ksuch that for f∈W∗,\nq(Th,f) =f(h).\nA natural norm on His deﬁned by\n/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblH= sup/braceleftBigg\n|f(h)|/radicalbig\nq(f,f):f∈W∗,f/\\e}atio\\slash= 0/bracerightBigg\n.\nThis makes Tinto an isometry, so /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblHis in fact induced by an inner product /a\\}b∇acketle{t·,·/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htHonH.\n15\nNext, we note that His continuously embedded into W. We have previously shown (using\nFernique) that the embedding of W∗intoKis continuous, i.e. q(f,f)≤C2/ba∇dblf/ba∇dbl2\nW∗. So forh∈H\nandf∈W∗, we have\n|f(h)|\n/ba∇dblf/ba∇dblW∗≤C|f(h)|/radicalbig\nq(f,f).\nWhen we take the supremum over all nonzero f∈W∗, the left side becomes /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblW(by Hahn–\nBanach) and the right side becomes C/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblH. So we have /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblW≤C/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblHand the inclusion\ni:H ֒→Wis continuous.\n(Redundant given the next paragraph.) Next, we check that ( H,/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblH) is complete. Suppose hn\nis Cauchy in H-norm. In particular, it is bounded in Hnorm, so say /ba∇dblhn/ba∇dblH≤Mfor alln. Since\nthe inclusion of HintoWis bounded, hnis also Cauchy in W-norm, hence converges in W-norm\nto somex∈W. Now ﬁxǫ>0, and choose nso large that ||hn−hm||H<ǫfor allm≥n. Given a\nnonzerof∈W∗, we can choose m≥nso large that |f(hm−x)| ≤ǫ/radicalbig\nq(f,f). Then\nf(hn−x)/radicalbig\nq(f,f)≤|f(hn−hm)/radicalbig\nq(f,f)+|f(hm−x)|/radicalbig\nq(f,f)</ba∇dblhn−hm/ba∇dblH+ǫ<2ǫ.\nWe can then take the supremum over fto ﬁnd that /ba∇dblhn−x/ba∇dblH<2ǫ, sohn→xinH-norm.\nNext, we claim the inverse of Tis given by\nJk=/integraldisplay\nWxk(x)µ(dx)\nwhere the integral is in the sense of Bochner. (To see that the integral exists, note that by Fernique\n/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dbl ∈L2(W,µ).) Forf∈W∗,k∈K, we have\n|f(Jk)|=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplay\nWf(x)k(x)µ(dx)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=|q(f,k)| ≤/radicalbig\nq(f,f)q(k,k)\nwhence/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/integraltext\nWxk(x)µ(dx)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble\nH≤/radicalbig\nq(k,k). SoJis a continuous operator from KtoH. Next, for\nf∈W∗we have\nq(TJk,f) =f(Jk) =q(k,f)\nas we just argued. Since W∗is dense in K, we haveTJk=k. In particular, Tis surjective, and\nhence unitary.\nQuestion 2. Could we have done this without the Bochner integral?\nWe previously showed that the inclusion map i:H→Wis continuous, and it’s clearly 1-1. It\nhas an adjoint operator i∗:W∗→H. We note that for f∈W∗andh∈H, we have\nq(f,Th) =f(h) =/a\\}b∇acketle{ti∗f,h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH=q(Ti∗f,Th).\nSinceTis surjective we have q(f,k) =q(Ti∗f,k) for allk∈K; thusTi∗is precisely the inclusion\nmapm:W∗→K. Sincemis compact and 1-1 and Tis unitary, it follows that i∗is compact and\n1-1.\nSincei∗is 1-1, it follows that His dense in W: iff∈W∗vanishes on H, it means that for all\nh∈H, 0 =f(h) =/a\\}b∇acketle{ti∗f,h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH, soi∗f= 0 andf= 0. The Hahn–Banach theorem then implies His\ndense inW. Moreover, Schauder’s theorem from functional analysis (s ee for example [3, Theorem\nVI.3.4]) states that an operator between Banach spaces is co mpact iﬀ its adjoint is compact, so i\nis compact as well. In particular, His not equal to W, and is not complete in the Wnorm.\nWe can sum up all these results with a diagram.\n16\nTheorem 4.20. The following diagram commutes.\nW∗\ni∗\n/d126/d126m/d47/d47K\nJ\n/d116/d116Hi/d47/d47T/d52/d52\nW(4.4)\nAll spaces are complete in their own norms. All dotted arrows are compact, 1-1, and have dense\nimage. All solid arrows are unitary.\nSometimes it’s convenient to work things out with a basis.\nProposition 4.21. There exists a sequence {ek}∞\nk=1⊂W∗which is an orthonormal basis for K.\nekare iidN(0,1)random variables under µ. Forh∈H, we have /ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2\nH=/summationtext∞\nk=1|ek(h)|2, and the\nsum is inﬁnite for h∈W\\H.\nProof.The existence of {ek}is proved in Lemma A.2.

We know that/summationtext\nkakekconverges in L2(W,µ), and is a sum of independent random variables (under µ), hence\nit converges µ-a.s. Thus µ(A) = 1. However, if y∈A, then/summationtextakek(y−x) diverges, so A−xis\ndisjoint from A, and thusµx(A) =µ(A−x) = 0.\nExercise 4.25. µhasfullsupport,i.e. foranynonemptyopenset U,µ(U)>0.

(Question: Can we prove this without needing t he\nCameron–Martin hammer? I think yes, look for references.)\nRemark 4.26.There really isn’t any generality lost by assuming that ( W,µ) is non-degenerate. If\nyou want to study the degenerate case, let F={f∈W∗:q(f,f) = 0}be the kernel of q, and\nconsider the closed subspace\nW0:=/intersectiondisplay\nf∈Fkerf⊂W.\nWe claim that µ(W0) = 1. For each f∈F, the condition q(f,f) =/integraltext\nf2dµ= 0 implies that\nf= 0µ-almost everywhere, so µ(kerf) = 1, but as written, W0is an uncountable intersection of\nsuch sets. To ﬁx that, note that since Wis separable, the unit ball B∗ofW∗is weak-* compact\nmetrizable, hence weak-* separable metrizable, hence so is its subsetF∩B∗. So we can choose a\ncountable weak-* sequence {fn} ⊂F∩B∗. Then I claim\nW0=/intersectiondisplay\nnkerfn.\nThe⊂inclusion is obvious. To see the other direction, suppose x∈/intersectiontext\nnkerfnandf∈F; we will\nshowf(x) = 0. By rescaling, we can assume without loss of generality t hatf∈B∗. Now choose a\nsubsequence fnkconverging weak-* to f; sincefnk(x) = 0 by assumption, we have f(x) = 0 also.\nNowW0is written as a countable intersection of measure-1 subsets, so µ(W0) = 1.\n18\nWe can now work on the abstract Wiener space ( W0,µ|W0). Note that the covariance form q0\ndeﬁned onW∗\n0byq0(f0,f0) =/integraltext\nW0f2\n0dµagrees with q, since given any extension f∈W∗off0will\nsatisfy\nq(f,f) =/integraldisplay\nWf2dµ=/integraldisplay\nW0f2dµ=/integraldisplay\nW0f2\n0dµ=q0(f0,f0).\nThis makes it easy to see that that q0is positive deﬁnite on W∗\n0. Supposeq0(f0,f0) = 0 and\nuse Hahn–Banach to choose an extension f∈W∗off0. Thenq(f,f) = 0, so by deﬁnition of W0,\nwe haveW0⊂kerf; that is,fvanishes on W0, so the restriction f0=f|W0is the zero functional.\nIt now follows, from the previous exercise, that the support ofµis precisely W0. So (W0,µ|W0)\nis a non-degenerate abstract Wiener space, and we can do all o ur work on this smaller space.\nI’d like to thank Philipp Wacker for suggesting this remark a nd sorting out some of the details.\n4.4 Example: Gaussian processes\nRecall that a one-dimensional stochastic process Xt,0≤t≤1 is said to be Gaussian if, for any\nt1,...,tn≥0, the random vector ( Xt1,...,X tn) has a joint Gaussian distribution. If the process\nis continuous, its distribution gives a probability measur eµonW=C([0,1]). If there is any good\nin the world, this ought to be an example of a Gaussian measure .\nBy the Riesz representation theorem, we know exactly what W∗is: it’s the set of all ﬁnite\nsigned Borel measures νon [0,1]. We don’t yet know that all of these measures represent Gau ssian\nrandom variables, but we know that some of them do. Let δtdenote the measure putting unit mass\natt, soδt(ω) =/integraltext1\n0ω(t)dδt=ω(t). We know that {δt}t∈[0,1]are jointly Gaussian. If we let E⊂W∗\nbe their linear span, i.e. the set of all ﬁnitely supported si gned measures, i.e. the set of measures\nν=/summationtextn\ni=1aiδti, then all measures in Eare Gaussian random variables.\nLemma 4.27. Eis weak-* dense in W∗, and dense in K.\nProof.Supposeν∈W∗. Given a partition P={0 =t0<···< tn= 1}of [0,1], setνP=/summationtextn\nj=1/integraltext\n1(tj−1,tj]dνδtj. Then for each ω∈C([0,1]),/integraltext\nωdνP=/integraltext\nωPdν, where\nωP=n/summationdisplay\nj=1ω(tj)1(tj−1,tj].\nBut by uniform continuity, as the mesh size of Pgoes to 0, we have ωP→ωuniformly, and so/integraltext\nωPdν→/integraltext\nωdν. ThusνP→νweakly-*.\nCorollary 4.28. µis a Gaussian measure.\nProof.Everyν∈W∗is a pointwise limit of a sequence of Gaussian random variabl es, hence\nGaussian.\nLemma 4.29. Eis dense in K.\nProof.{νP}is bounded in total variation (in fact /ba∇dblνP/ba∇dbl ≤ /ba∇dblν/ba∇dbl). So by Fernique’s theorem and\ndominated convergence, νP→νinL2(X,µ). ThusEisL2-dense inW∗. SinceW∗isL2-dense in\nK,Eis dense in K.\n19\nNote that in order to get µto be non-degenerate, it may be necessary to replace Wby a smaller\nspace. For example, if Xtis Brownian motion started at 0, the linear functional ω/ma√sto→ω(0) is a.s.\nzero. So we should take W={ω∈C([0,1]) :ω(0) = 0}. One might write this as C0((0,1]).\nRecall that a Gaussian process is determined by its covarian ce function a(s,t) =E[XsXt] =\nq(δs,δt). Some examples:\n1. Standard Brownian motion Xt=Btstarted at 0: a(s,t) =sfors<t. Markov, martingale,\nindependent increments, stationary increments.\n2. Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process deﬁned by dXt=−Xtdt+σdBt:a(s,t) =σ2\n2(e−(t−s)−e−(t+s)),\ns<t. Markov, not a martingale.\n3. Fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H∈(0,1):a(s,t) =1\n2(t2H+s2H−(t−\ns)2H),s<t. Not Markov.\n4. Brownian bridge Xt=Bt−tB1:a(s,t) =s(1−t),s < t. (HereWshould be taken as\n{ω∈C([0,1]) :ω(0) =ω(1) = 0}=C0((0,1)), the so-called pinned loop space.)\nLemma 4.30. The covariance form qfor a Gaussian process is deﬁned by\nq(ν1,ν2) =/integraldisplay1\n0/integraldisplay1\n0a(s,t)ν1(ds)ν2(dt)\nforν1,ν2∈W∗.\nProof.Fubini’s theorem, justiﬁed with the help of Fernique.\nLemma 4.31. J:K→His deﬁned by Jk(t) =q(k,δt). Fork=ν∈W∗this givesJν(t) =\ni∗ν(t) =/integraltext1\n0a(s,t)ν(ds). In particular Jδs(t) =a(s,t).\nProof.Jk(t) =δt(Jk) =q(k,δt).\nObserve that aplays the role of a reproducing kernel in H: we have\n/a\\}b∇acketle{th,a(s,·)/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH=/a\\}b∇acketle{th,Jδs/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht=δs(h) =h(s).\nThis is why His sometimes called the “reproducing kernel Hilbert space” or “RKHS” for W.\n4.5 Classical Wiener space\nLetµbe Wiener measure on classical Wiener space W, soa(s,t) =s∧t.\nTheorem 4.32. The Cameron–Martin space H⊂Wis given by the set of all h∈Wwhich are\nabsolutely continuous and have ˙h∈L2([0,1],m). The Cameron-Martin inner product is given by\n/a\\}b∇acketle{th1,h2/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH=/integraltext1\n0˙h1(t)˙h2(t)dt.\nProof.Let˜Hbe the candidate space with the candidate norm /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dbl˜H. It’s easy to see that ˜His a\nHilbert space.\nNote thatJδs(t) =s∧t∈˜H, so by linearity JmapsEinto˜H. Note ˙Jδs= 1[0,s]. Moreover,\n/a\\}b∇acketle{tJδs,Jδr/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht˜H=/integraldisplay1\n01[0,s]1[0,r]dm=s∧r=q(δs,δr)\nsoJis an isometry from ( E,q) to˜H. Hence it extends to an isometry of Kto˜H. SinceJis already\nan isometry from KtoHwe haveH=˜Hisometrically.\n20\nNow what can we say about T? It’s a map that takes a continuous function from Hand returns\na random variable. Working informally, we would say that\nTh(ω) =/a\\}b∇acketle{th,ω/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH=/integraldisplay1\n0˙h(t)˙ω(t)dt. (4.5)\nThis formula is absurd because ˙ ωis nonexistent for µ-a.e.ω(Brownian motion sample paths are\nnowhere diﬀerentiable). However, it is actually the right an swer if interpreted correctly.\nLet’s suppose that his piecewise linear: then its derivative is a step function ˙h=/summationtextn\ni=1bi1[ci,di].\nNote that the reproducing kernel a(s,·) has as its derivative the step function 1 [0,s]. So by inte-\ngrating, we see that we can write\nh(t) =n/summationdisplay\ni=1bi(a(di,t)−a(ci,t)).\nNow we know that T[a(s,·)] =δs, i.e. the random variable Bs. So we have\nTh=n/summationdisplay\ni=1bi(Bdi−Bci).\nWe can recognize this as the stochastic integral of the step f unction˙h=/summationtextn\ni=1bi1[ci,di]:\nTh=/integraldisplay1\n0˙h(t)dBt. (4.6)\nMoreover, by the Itˆ o isometry we know that\n/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/integraldisplay1\n0˙h(t)dBt/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble2\nL2(W,µ)=/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble˙h/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble2\nL2([0,1])=/ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2\nH.\nThus both sides of (4.6) are isometries on H, and they are equal for all piecewise linear H. Since\nthe step functions are dense in L2([0,1]), the piecewise linear functions are dense in H(take\nderivatives), so in fact (4.6) holds for all h∈H. We have rediscovered the stochastic integral, at\nleast for deterministic integrands. This is sometimes call ed the Wiener integral. Of course, the\nItˆ o integral also works for stochastic integrands, as long as they are adapted to the ﬁltration of\nthe Brownian motion. Later we shall use our machinery to prod uce the Skorohod integral, which\nwill generalize the Itˆ o integral to integrands which need n ot be adapted, giving us an “anticipating\nstochastic calculus.”\nExercise 4.33. For the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, show that His again the set of absolutely\ncontinuous functions hwith˙h∈L2([0,1]), and the Cameron–Martin inner product is given by\n/a\\}b∇acketle{th1,h2/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH=1\nσ2/integraldisplay1\n0˙h1(t)˙h2(t)+h1(t)h2(t)dt.\nExercise 4.34. For the Brownian bridge, show that His again the set of absolutely continuous\nfunctionshwith˙h∈L2([0,1]), and the Cameron–Martin inner product is given by /a\\}b∇acketle{th1,h2/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH=/integraltext1\n0ˆh1(t)ˆh2(t)dt, where\nˆh(t) =˙h(t)+h(t)\n1−t.\n21\nPerhaps later when we look at some stochastic diﬀerential equ ations, we will see where these\nformulas come from.\nNote that in this case the Cameron–Martin theorem is a specia l case of Girsanov’s theorem:\nit says that a Brownian motion with a “smooth” drift becomes a Brownian motion without drift\nunder an equivalent measure. Indeed, suppose h∈H. If we write Bt(ω) =ω(t), so that {Bt}is\na Brownian motion on ( W,µ), thenBt+h(t) is certainly a Brownian motion (without drift!) on\n(W,µh). The Cameron-Martin theorem says that µhis an equivalent measure to µ. Anything that\nBtcan’t do,Bt+h(t) can’t do either (since the µ-null andµh-null sets are the same). This fact has\nmany useful applications. For example, in mathematical ﬁna nce, one might model the price of an\nasset by a geometric Brownian motion with a drift indicating its average rate of return (as in the\nBlack–Scholes model). The Cameron–Martin/Girsanov theor em provides an equivalent measure\nunder which this process is a martingale, which makes it poss ible to compute the arbitrage-free\nprice for options involving the asset. The equivalence of th e measures is important because it\nguarantees that changing the measure didn’t allow arbitrag e opportunities to creep in.\n4.6 Construction of (W,µ)fromH\nThis section originates in [10] via Bruce Driver’s notes [5] .\nWhenW=Rnis ﬁnite-dimensional and µis non-degenerate, the Cameron–Martin space His\nall ofW(sinceHis known to be dense in W), and one can check that the Cameron–Martin norm\nis\n/a\\}b∇acketle{tx,y/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH=x·Σ−1y (4.7)\nwhere Σ is the covariance matrix. We also know that µhas a density with respect to Lebesgue\nmeasuredx, which we can write as\nµ(dx) =1\nZe−1\n2/bardblx/bardbl2\nHdx (4.8)\nwhereZ=/integraltext\nRne−1\n2/bardblx/bardbl2\nHdxis a normalizing constant chosen to make µa probability measure.\nInformally, we can think of µas being given by a similar formula in inﬁnite dimensions:\nµ(dx)“ = ”1\nZe−1\n2/bardblx/bardbl2\nHDx (4.9)\nwhereZis an appropriate normalizing constant, and Dxis inﬁnite-dimensional Lebesgue measure.\nOf course this is nonsense in at least three diﬀerent ways, but that doesn’t stop physicists, for\ninstance.\nFor classical Wiener measure this reads\nµ(dx)“ = ”1\nZe−1\n2/integraltext1\n0|˙ω(t)|2dtDω. (4.10)\nSince the only meaningful object appearing on the right side of (4.9) is /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblH, it is reasonable to\nask if we can start with a Hilbert space Hand produce an abstract Wiener space ( W,µ) for which\nHis the Cameron–Martin space.\n22\n4.6.1 Cylinder sets\nLet (H,/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblH) be a separable Hilbert space.\nDeﬁnition 4.35. Acylinder set is a subset C⊂Hof the form\nC={h∈H: (/a\\}b∇acketle{th,k1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH,...,/a\\}b∇acketle{th,kn/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH)∈A} (4.11)\nfor somen≥1, orthonormal k1,...,kn, andA⊂RnBorel.\nExercise 4.36. LetRdenote the collection of all cylinder sets in H.Ris an algebra: we have\n∅ ∈ RandRis closed under complements and ﬁniteunions (and intersections). However, if His\ninﬁnite dimensional then Ris not aσ-algebra.\nNote by Lemma 4.4 that σ(R) =BH, the Borel σ-algebra.\nWe are going to try to construct a Gaussian measure ˜ µonHwith covariance form given by\n/a\\}b∇acketle{t·,·/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH. Obviously we can only get so far, since we know of several obs tructions to completing\nthe task. At some point we will have to do something diﬀerent. B ut by analogy with ﬁnite\ndimensions, we know what value ˜ µshould give to a cylinder set of the form (4.11): since k1,...,kn\nare orthonormal, they should be iid standard normal with res pect to ˜µ, so we should have\n˜µ(C) =µn(A) (4.12)\nwheredµn=1\n(2π)n/2e−|x|2/2dxis standard Gaussian measure on Rn.\nProposition 4.37. The expression for ˜µ(C)in (4.12) is well-deﬁned, and ˜µis a ﬁnitely additive\nprobability measure on R.\nProof.To check that ˜ µ(C) is well-deﬁned, suppose that\nC={h∈H: (/a\\}b∇acketle{th,k1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH,...,/a\\}b∇acketle{th,kn/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH)∈A⊂Rn}={h∈H: (/a\\}b∇acketle{th,k′\n1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH,...,/a\\}b∇acketle{th,k′\nn′/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH)∈A′⊂Rn′}.\n(4.13)\nLetEbe the span in Hof{k1,...,kn,k′\n1,...,k′\nn′}, and letm= dimE. Since {k1,...,kn}is\northonormal in E, we can extend it to an orthonormal basis {k1,...,km}forE, and then we have\nC={h∈H: (/a\\}b∇acketle{th,k1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH,...,/a\\}b∇acketle{th,km/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH)∈A×Rm−n}.\nSinceµmis a product measure, we have µm(A×Rm−n) =µn(A). So by playing the same game\nfor{k′\n1,...,k′\nn′}, there is no loss of generality in assuming that in (4.13) we h aven=n′=m, and\nthat{k1,...,km}and{k′\n1,...,k′\nm}are two orthonormal bases for the same E⊂H. We then have\nto show that µm(A) =µm(A′).\nWe have two orthonormal bases for E, so there is a unitary T:E→Esuch thatTki=k′\ni. Let\nP:H→Ebe orthogonal projection, and deﬁne S:E→RmbySx= ((x,k1),...,(x,km)). Then\nSis unitary. If we deﬁne S′analogously, then S′=ST∗=ST, and we have\nC=P−1S−1A=P−1S′−1A′=P−1T−1S−1A′.\nSinceP:H→Eis surjective, we must have S−1A=T−1S−1A′; sinceS,Tare bijective this says\nA′=STS−1A, soA′is the image of Aunder a unitary map. But standard Gaussian measure\n23\nonRmis invariant under unitary transformations, so indeed µm(A) =µm(A′), and the expression\n(4.12) is well deﬁned.\nIt is obvious that ˜ µ(∅) = 0 and ˜ µ(H) = 1. For ﬁnite additivity, suppose C1,...,C n∈ R\nare disjoint. By playing the same game as above, we can write Ci=P−1(Ai) for some common\nP:H→Rm, where the Ai⊂Rmare necessarily disjoint, and then ˜ µ(Ci) =µm(Ai). Since/uniontext\niCi=P−1(/uniontext\niAi), the additivity of µmgives us that ˜ µ(/uniontext\niCi) =/summationtext\ni˜µ(Ci).\nWe will call ˜ µthe canonical Gaussian measure on H. As we see in the next proposition, we’re\nusing the term “measure” loosely.\nProposition 4.38. IfHis inﬁnite dimensional, ˜µis not countably additive on R. In particular,\nit does not extend to a countably additive measure on σ(R) =BH.\nProof.Fix an orthonormal sequence {ei}inH. Let\nAn,k={x∈H:|/a\\}b∇acketle{tx,ei/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht| ≤k,i= 1,...,n}.\nAn,kisacylinderset, andwehave B(0,k)⊂An,kforanyn. Also, wehave ˜ µ(An,k) =µn([−k,k]n) =\nµ1([−k,k])nsinceµnis a product measure. Since µ1([−k,k])<1, for each kwe can choose an nk\nso large that ˜ µ(Ank,k) =µ1([−k,k])nk<2−k. Thus/summationtext∞\nk=1˜µ(Ank,k)<1, but since B(0,k)⊂Ank,k\nwe have/uniontext∞\nk=1Ank,k=Hand ˜µ(H) = 1. So countable additivity does not hold.\nOf course we already knew that this construction cannot prod uce a genuine Gaussian measure\nonH, since any Gaussian measure has to assign measure 0 to its Cam eron–Martin space. The\ngenuine measure has to live on some larger space W, so we have to ﬁnd a way to produce W.\nWe’ll produce it by producing a new norm /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblWonHwhich is not complete, and set Wto be the\ncompletion of Hunder/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblW. Then we will be able to extend ˜ µ, in a certain sense, to an honest\nBorel measure µonW.\nIt’s common to make an analogy here with Lebesgue measure. Su ppose we were trying to\nconstruct Lebesgue measure monQ. We could deﬁne the measure of an interval ( a,b)⊂Qto\nbeb−a, and this would give a ﬁnitely additive measure on the algebr a of sets generated by such\nintervals. But it could not be countably additive. If we want a countably additive measure, it has\nto live on R, which we can obtain as the completion of Qunder the Euclidean metric.\n4.6.2 Measurable norms\nDeﬁnition 4.39. By aﬁnite rank projection we mean a map P:H→Hwhich is orthogonal\nprojection onto its image PHwithPHﬁnite dimensional. We will sometimes abuse notation and\nidentifyPwith the ﬁnite-dimensional subspace PH, since they are in 1-1 correspondence. We will\nwrite things like P1⊥P2,P1⊂P2, etc.\nWe are going to obtain Was the completion of Hunder some norm /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblW. Here is the condition\nthat this norm has to satisfy.\nDeﬁnition 4.40. A norm /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblWonHis said to be measurable if for every ǫ >0 there exists a\nﬁnite rank projection P0such that\n˜µ({h:/ba∇dblPh/ba∇dblW>ǫ})<ǫfor allP⊥P0of ﬁnite rank (4.14)\nwhere ˜µis the canonical Gaussian “measure” on H. (Note that {x:/ba∇dblPh/ba∇dblW>ǫ}is a cylinder set.)\n24\nA quick remark: if P0satisﬁes (4.14) for some ǫ, andP0⊂P′\n0, thenP′\n0also satisﬁes (4.14) for\nthe sameǫ. This is because any P⊥P′\n0also hasP⊥P0.\nIn words, this deﬁnition requires that ˜ µputs most of its mass in “tubular neighborhoods” of\nP0H. Saying /ba∇dblPh/ba∇dblW>ǫmeans that xis more than distance ǫ(inW-norm) from P0Halong one\nof the directions from PH.\nAs usual, doing the simplest possible thing doesn’t work.\nLemma 4.41. /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblHis not a measurable norm on H.\nProof.Foranyﬁnite-rankprojection Pofsomerank n,wecanﬁndanorthonormalbasis {h1,...,h n}\nforPH. Then it’s clear that Ph=/summationtextn\ni=1/a\\}b∇acketle{th,hi/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htHhi, so{h:/ba∇dblPh/ba∇dblH>ǫ}=P−1(BPH(0,ǫ)C), where\nBPH(0,ǫ) is a ball in PH. By deﬁnition of ˜ µwe can see that\n˜µ({h:/ba∇dblPh/ba∇dblH>ǫ}) =µn(BRn(0,ǫ)c)\n≥µn(([−ǫ,ǫ]n)C)\n(since the ball is contained in the cube)\n= 1−µ1([−ǫ,ǫ])n.\nThusforany ǫ>0andany ﬁnite-rankprojection P0, ifwechoose nsolargethat 1 −µ1([−ǫ,ǫ])n>ǫ,\nthen for any projection Pof ranknwhich is orthogonal to P0(of which there are lots), we have\n˜µ({h:/ba∇dblPh/ba∇dblH>ǫ})>ǫ. So/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblHis not measurable.\nAs a diversion, let’s explicitly verify this for the classic al example.\nProposition 4.42. LetHbe the classical Cameron–Martin space of Theorem 4.32. The supr emum\nnorm/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblW= supt∈[0,1]h(t)is a measurable norm on H.\nTogether with Gross’s theorem (Theorem 4.44 below), this pr oposition constitutes a construc-\ntion of Brownian motion: the completion WofHunder/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblWis precisely C([0,1]) (sinceHis dense\ninC([0,1])), and the measure µonWis Wiener measure (having Has its Cameron–Martin space,\nwe can check that its covariance function is a(s,t) =s∧tas it ought to be).\nWith the proof we will give, however, it will not be an essenti ally new construction. Indeed, we\nare going to steal the key ideas from a construction which is a pparently due to L´ evy and can be\nfound in [12, Section 2.3], which one might beneﬁt from readi ng in conjunction with this proof. In\nsome sense, Gross’s theorem is simply an abstract version of an essential step of that construction.\nProof.Observe up front that by Cauchy–Schwarz\n|h(t)|=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplayt\n0˙h(t)dt/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤t/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblH\nso taking the supremum over t∈[0,1], we have /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblW≤ /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblH.\nWe want to choose a good orthonormal basis for H. We use the so-called “Schauder functions”\nwhich correspond to the “Haar functions” in L2([0,1]). The Haar functions are given by\nfn\nk(t) :=\n\n2(n−1)/2,k−1\n2n≤t<k\n2n\n−2(n−1)/2,k\n2n≤t≤k+1\n2n\n0, else\n25\nwheref1\n0= 1. Here kshould be taken to range over the set I(n) consisting of all odd integers\nbetween 0 and 2n. (This somewhat peculiar indexing is from Karatzas and Shre ve’s proof. It may\nor may not be optimal.) We note that for n≥1, we have/integraltext1\n0fn\nk(t)dt= 0; that for n > m,fm\njis\nconstant on the support of fn\nk; and that for ﬁxed n,{fn\nk:k∈I(n)}have disjoint supports. From\nthis it is not hard to check that {fn\nk:k∈I(n),n≥0}are an orthonormal set in L2(0,1). Indeed,\nthe set forms an orthonormal basis.\nThe Schauder functions are deﬁned by hn\nk(t) :=/integraltextt\n0fn\nk(s)ds; sincef/ma√sto→/integraltext·\n0fdtis an isometric\nisomorphism from L2([0,1]) toH, we have that {hn\nk:k∈I(n),n≥0}is an orthonormal basis for\nH. (We can check easily that it is a basis: if /a\\}b∇acketle{th,hn\nk/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH= 0 thenh(k−1\n2n) =h(k+1\n2n). If this holds for\nalln,k, thenh(t) = 0 for all dyadic rationals t, whence by continuity h= 0.)

LetWbe the completion of Hunder/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblW. There exists a Gaussian measure µon\n(W,/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblW)whose Cameron-Martin space is (H,/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblH).\nProof.We start by constructing a sequence of ﬁnite-rank projectio nsPninductively. First, pick a\ncountable dense sequence {vn}ofH. LetP0= 0. Then suppose that Pn−1has been given. By the\nmeasurability of /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblW, for eachnwe can ﬁnd a ﬁnite-rank projection Pnsuch that for all ﬁnite-rank\nprojections P⊥Pn, we have\n˜µ({h∈H:/ba∇dblPh/ba∇dblW>2−n})<2−n.\nAs weremarked earlier, wecan always choose Pnto belarger, sowecan also assumethat Pn−1⊂Pn\nand alsovn∈PnH. The latter condition ensures that/uniontext\nnPnHis dense inH, from which it follows\nthatPnh→hinH-norm for all h∈H, i.e.Pn↑Istrongly. Let us also note that Rn:=Pn−Pn−1\nis a ﬁnite-rank projection which is orthogonal to Pn−1(in fact, it is projection onto the orthogonal\ncomplement of Pn−1inPn), and in fact we have the orthogonal decomposition H=/circleplustext∞\nn=1RnH.\nGiven an orthonormal basis for PnH, we can extend it to an orthonormal basis for Pn+1H.\nRepeating this process, we can ﬁnd a sequence {hj}∞\nj=1such that {h1,...,h kn}is an orthonormal\nbasisforPnH. Since/uniontextPnHisdenseinH, itfollows thattheentiresequence {hj}is anorthonormal\nbasis forH.\nLet{Xn}be a sequence of iid standard normal random variables deﬁned on some unrelated\nprobability space (Ω ,F,P). Consider the W-valued random variable\nSn=kn/summationdisplay\nj=1Xjhj.\nNote thatSn−Sn−1has a standard normal distribution on the ﬁnite-dimensiona l Hilbert space\nRnH, so by deﬁnition of ˜ µwe have\nP(/ba∇dblSn−Sn−1/ba∇dblW>2−n) = ˜µ({h∈H:/ba∇dblRnh/ba∇dblW>2−n})<2−n.\nThus/summationtext\nnP(/ba∇dblSn−Sn−1/ba∇dblW>2−n)<∞, and by Borel–Cantelli, we have that, P-almost surely,\n/ba∇dblSn−Sn−1/ba∇dblW≤2−nfor all but ﬁnitely many n. In particular, P-a.s.,Snis Cauchy in W-norm,\nand hence convergent to some W-valued random variable S.\nLetµ=P◦S−1be the law of S;µis a Borel measure on W. Iff∈W∗, thenf(S) =\nlimn→∞f(Sn) = lim n→∞/summationtextkn\nj=1f(hj)Xjis a limit of Gaussian random variables. Hence by Lemma\nA.3f(S) is Gaussian, and moreover we have\n∞>Var(f(S)) = lim\nn→∞Var(f(Sn)) = lim\nn→∞kn/summationdisplay\nj=1|f(hj)|2=∞/summationdisplay\nj=1|f(hj)|2.\nPushing forward, we have that fis a Gaussian random variable on ( W,µ) with variance q(f,f) =/summationtext∞\nj=1|f(hj)|2<∞. Soµis a Gaussian measure and qis its covariance form. Let Hµbe the\nCameron–Martin space associated to ( W,µ). We want to show that H=Hµisometrically. This is\nbasically just another diagram chase.\n28\nLetidenote the inclusion map i:H ֒→W. We know by Lemma 4.43 that iis 1-1, continuous\nand has dense range, so its adjoint i∗:W∗→His also 1-1 and continuous with dense range\n(Exercise C.7). Also, we have\n/ba∇dbli∗f/ba∇dbl2\nH=∞/summationdisplay\nj=1|/a\\}b∇acketle{ti∗f,hj/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH|2=∞/summationdisplay\nj=1|f(hj)|2=q(f,f)\nso thati∗: (W∗,q)→His an isometry.\nNext, for any h∈Hand anyf∈W∗, Cauchy–Schwarz gives\n|f(h)|2=|/a\\}b∇acketle{ti∗f,h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH|2≤ /ba∇dbli∗f/ba∇dbl2\nH/ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2\nH=q(f,f)/ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2\nH\nso thatf/ma√sto→f(h) is a continuous linear functional on ( W∗,q). That is,h∈Hµ, and rearranging and\ntaking the supremum over fshows/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblHµ≤ /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblH. On the other hand, if fn∈W∗withi∗fn→h\ninH, we have by deﬁnition\n|fn(h)|/radicalbig\nq(fn,fn)≤ /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblHµ.\nAsn→ ∞,fn(h) =/a\\}b∇acketle{ti∗fn,h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH→ /ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2\nH, and since i∗is an isometry, q(fn,fn) =/ba∇dbli∗fn/ba∇dbl2\nH→ /ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2\nH,\nso the left side tends to /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblH. Thus/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblH=/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblhµ.\nWe have shown H⊂Hµisometrically; we want equality. Note that His closed in Hµ, since\nHis complete in H-norm and hence also in Hµ-norm. So it suﬃces to show His dense in Hµ.\nSuppose there exists g∈Hµwith/a\\}b∇acketle{tg,h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htHµ= 0 for allh∈H. Ifiµ:Hµ֒→Wis the inclusion map,\nwe know that i∗\nµ: (W∗,q)→Hµhas dense image and is an isometry. So choose fn∈W∗with\ni∗\nµfn→ginHµ. Thenfnisq-Cauchy, and so i∗fnconverges in H-norm to some k∈H.

If hjis an orthonormal basis for H, then\nS=/summationtextXjhjshould be a random variable with law µ. However, this sum diverges in Halmost\nsurely (since/summationtext|Xj|2=∞a.s.). So if we want it to converge, we have to choose a weaker n orm.\nThe condition of measurability is not only suﬃcient but also necessary.\nTheorem 4.45. Let(W,µ)be an abstract Wiener space with Cameron–Martin space H. Then\n/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblWis a measurable norm on H.\nThe ﬁrst proof of this statement, in this generality, seems t o have appeared in [6]. For a nice\nproof due to Daniel Stroock, see Bruce Driver’s notes [5].\nRemark 4.46.The mere existence of a measurable norm on a given Hilbert spa ceHis trivial.\nIndeed, since all inﬁnite-dimensional separable Hilbert s paces are isomorphic, as soon as we have\nfound a measurable norm for one Hilbert space, we have found o ne for any Hilbert space.\n29\nOne might wonder if the completion Whas any restrictions on its structure. Equivalently,\nwhich separable Banach spaces Wadmit Gaussian measures? This is a reasonable question, sin ce\nBanach spaces can have strange “geometry.”3However, the answer is that there are no restrictions.\nTheorem 4.47 (Gross[10, Remark2]) .IfWis any separable Banach space, there exists a separable\nHilbert space densely embedded in W, on which the W-norm is measurable. Equivalently, there exists\na non-degenerate Gaussian measure on W.\nProof.The ﬁnite-dimensional case is trivial, so we suppose Wis inﬁnite dimensional. We start\nwith the case of Hilbert spaces.\nFirst, there exists a separable (inﬁnite-dimensional) Hil bert spaceWwith a densely embedded\nseparable Hilbert space Hon which the W-norm is measurable. Proposition 4.59 tells us that,\ngiven any separable Hilbert space H, we can construct a measurable norm /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblWonHby letting\n/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblW=/ba∇dblAh/ba∇dblH, whereAis a Hilbert–Schmidt operator on H. Note that /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblWis induced by the\ninner product /a\\}b∇acketle{th,k/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htW=/a\\}b∇acketle{tAh,Ak/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH, so if we let Wbe the completion of Hunder/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblW, thenW\nis a separable Hilbert space with Hdensely embedded. (We should take Ato be injective. An\nexample of such an operator is given by taking an orthonormal basis{en}and letting Aen=1\nnen.)\nNow, since all inﬁnite-dimensional separable Hilbert spac es are isomorphic, this shows that the\ntheorem holds for any separable Hilbert space W.\nSuppose now that Wis a separable Banach space. By the following lemma, there ex ists a\nseparable Hilbert space H1densely embedded in W. In turn, there is a separable Hilbert space H\ndensely embedded in H1, on which the H1-norm is measurable. The W-norm onHis weaker than\ntheH1-norm, so it is measurable as well. (Exercise: check the deta ils.)\nAlternatively, there exists a non-degenerate Gaussian mea sureµ1onH1. Push it forward under\nthe inclusion map. As an exercise, verify that this gives a no n-degenerate Gaussian measure on\nW.\nLemma 4.48 (Gross).IfWis a separable Banach space, there exists a separable Hilber t spaceH\ndensely embedded in W.\nProof.We repeat a construction of Gross [10]. Since Wis separable, we may ﬁnd a countable\nset{zi} ⊂Wwhose linear span is dense in W; without loss of generality, we can take {zn}to\nbe linearly independent. We will construct an inner product /a\\}b∇acketle{t·,·/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htKonK= span{zi}such that\n/ba∇dblx/ba∇dblW≤ /ba∇dblx/ba∇dblKfor allx∈K; thusKwill be an inner product space densely embedded in W.\nWe inductively construct a sequence {ai}such thatai/\\e}atio\\slash= 0 for any real numbers b1,...,bnwith/summationtextn\ni=1b2\ni≤1, we have /ba∇dbl/summationtextn\ni=1aibizi/ba∇dblW<1. To begin, choose a1with 0<|a1|</ba∇dblz1/ba∇dbl−1\nW. Suppose\nnow thata1,...,a n−1have been appropriately chosen. Let Dn={(b1,...,bn) :/summationtextn\ni=1b2\nn≤1 be the\nclosed Euclidean unit disk of Rnand consider the map f:Dn×R→Wdeﬁned by\nf(b1,...,bn,a) =n−1/summationdisplay\ni=1aibizi+abnzn.\nNowfis obviously continuous, and by the induction hypothesis we havef(Dn×{0})⊂S, where\nSis the open unit ball of W. So by continuity, f−1(S) is an open set containing Dn×{0}; hence\n3A particularly bizarre example was given recently in [1]: a s eparable Banach space Xsuch that every bounded\noperator TonXis of the form T=λI+K, where Kis a compact operator. In some sense, Xhas almost the\nminimum possible number of bounded operators.\n30\nf−1(S) contains some set of the form Dn×(−ǫ,ǫ). Thus if we choose any anwith 0≤ |an|<ǫ, we\nhave the desired property for a1,...,a n.\nSetyi=aizi; since theaiare nonzero, the yispanKand are linearly independent. Let /a\\}b∇acketle{t·,·/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htKbe\ntheinnerproducton Kwhichmakes the yiorthonormal; then wehave /ba∇dbl/summationtextn\ni=1biyi/ba∇dbl2\nK=/summationtextn\ni=1b2\ni. By\nourconstruction, wehave thatany x∈Kwith/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl2\nK≤1has/ba∇dblx/ba∇dblW<1aswell, so Kiscontinuously\nand densely embedded in W. That is to say, the inclusion map i: (K,/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblK)→(W,/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblW) is\ncontinuous.\nLet¯Kbe the abstract completion of K, so¯Kis a Hilbert space. Since Wis Banach, the\ncontinuous map i:K→Wextends to a continuous map ¯i:¯K→Wwhose image is dense (as it\ncontainsK). It is possible that ¯iis not injective, so let H= (ker¯i)⊥be the orthogonal complement\nin¯Kof its kernel. His a closed subspace of ¯K, hence a Hilbert space in its own right, and the\nrestriction ¯i|H:H→Wis continuous and injective, and its range is the same as that of¯i, hence\nstill dense in W.\nRemark 4.49.The ﬁnal step of the previous proof (passing to (ker ¯i)⊥) is missing from Gross’s\noriginal proof, as was noticed by Ambar Sengupta, who asked i f it is actually necessary. Here is an\nexample to show that it is.\nLetWbe a separable Hilbert space with orthonormal basis {en}∞\nn=1, and letSbe the left shift\noperatordeﬁnedby Se1= 0,Sen=en−1forn≥2. Notethatthekernel of Sisone-dimensional and\nspanned by e1. LetEbe the subspace of Wspanned by the vectors hn=en−en+1,n= 1,2,.... It\nis easy to check that e1/∈E, so the restriction of StoEis injective. On the other hand, Eis dense\ninW: for suppose x∈E⊥. Since/a\\}b∇acketle{tx,hn/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htW= 0, we have /a\\}b∇acketle{tx,en/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htW=/a\\}b∇acketle{tx,en+1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htW, so in fact there is a\nconstantcwith/a\\}b∇acketle{tx,en/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htW=cfor alln. But Parseval’s identity says/summationtext∞\nn=1|/a\\}b∇acketle{tx,en/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htW|2=/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl2\nW<∞\nso we must have c= 0 and thus x= 0.\nWe also remark that SEis also dense in W: sinceShn=hn−1, we actually have E⊂SE.\nSo we have a separable inner product space E, a separable Hilbert space W, and a continuous\ninjective map S|E:E→Wwith dense image, such that the continuous extension of S|Eto the\ncompletion of E(namelyW) is not injective (since the extension is just Sagain).\nTomakethislookmorelikeGross’sconstruction, wejustren amethings.

By\napplying the Gram–Schmidt algorithm to {hn}, we get an orthonormal set {gn}(with respect to\n/a\\}b∇acketle{t·,·/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htW) which still spans E. (In fact, {gn}is also an orthonormal basis for W.) Takezn=Sgn; the\nzns arelinearly independentandspan K, whichisdensein W. If/summationtextn\ni=1b2\ni≤1, then/ba∇dbl/summationtextn\ni=1bizi/ba∇dblW=\n/ba∇dblS/summationtextn\ni=1bigi/ba∇dblW≤1 becauseSis a contraction and the giare orthonormal. So we can take ai= 1\nin the induction.4Then of course the inner product which makes the znorthonormal is just /a\\}b∇acketle{t·,·/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htK.\nWe can make the issue even more explicit: consider the series/summationtext∞\nn=1/a\\}b∇acketle{tgn,e1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htWzn. Under /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblK,\nthis series is Cauchy, since znis orthonormal and/summationtext\nn|/a\\}b∇acketle{tgn,e1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htW|2=/ba∇dble1/ba∇dbl2\nW= 1; and its limit is not\nzero, since there must be some gkwith/a\\}b∇acketle{tgk,e1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htW/\\e}atio\\slash= 0, and then we have /a\\}b∇acketle{tzk,/summationtextm\nn=1/a\\}b∇acketle{tgn,e1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htWzn/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht=\n/a\\}b∇acketle{tgk,e1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htWfor allm≥k. So the series corresponds to some nonzero element of the com pletion¯K.\n4Technically, since we were supposed to have /bardbl/summationtextaibizi/bardblW<1 with a strict inequality, we should take ai=c <1,\nand this argument will actually produce c/bardbl·/bardblKinstead of /bardbl·/bardblK, which of course makes no diﬀerence.\n31\nHowever, under /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblH, the series converges to zero, since/summationtextm\nn=1/a\\}b∇acketle{tgn,e1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htWzn=S/summationtextm\nn=1/a\\}b∇acketle{tgn,e1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htWgn→\nSe1= 0, using the continuity of Sand the fact that gnis an orthonormal basis for W.\nThe following theorem points out that measurable norms are f ar from unique.\nTheorem 4.50.

Then there\nexists another measurable norm /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblW′which is stronger than /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblW, and if we write W,W′for the\ncorresponding completions, the inclusions H ֒→W′֒→Ware compact.\nProof.See [14, Lemma 4.5].\n4.7 Gaussian measures on Hilbert spaces\nWe have been discussing Gaussian measures on separable Bana ch spacesW.

In this case, there is more that can be said about\nthe relationship between Wand its Cameron–Martin space H.\nLetH,Kbe separable Hilbert spaces.\nExercise 4.51.

Fort≥0, letµtbe the rescaled measure µt(A) =µ(t−1/2A) (withµ0=δ0). It\nis easy to check that µtis a Gaussian measure on Wwith covariance form qt(f,g) =tq(f,g). For\nshort, we could call µtGaussian measure with variance t.\nExercise 5.2. IfWis ﬁnite dimensional, then µs∼µtfor alls,t.

There exists a stochastic process {Bt,t≥0}with values in Wwhich is a.s. con-\ntinuous int(with respect to the norm topology on W), has independent increments, and for t>s\nhasBt−Bs∼µt−s, withB0= 0a.s.Btis called standard Brownian motion on (W,µ).\nProof.Your favorite proof of the existence of one-dimensional Bro wnian motion should work. For\ninstance, one can use the Kolmogorov extension theorem to co nstruct a countable set of W-valued\nrandom variables {Bt:t∈E}, indexed by the dyadic rationals E, with independent increments\nandBt−Bs∼µt−s. (The consistency of the relevant family of measures comes f rom the property\nµt∗µs=µt+s, just as in the one-dimensional case.) If you are worried tha t you only know the\nKolmogorov extension theorem for R-valued random variables, you can use the fact that any Polis h\nspace can be measurably embedded into [0 ,1]. Then the Kolmogorov continuity theorem (replacing\nabsolute values with /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblW) can be used to show that, almost surely, Btis H¨ older continuous as a\nfunction between the metric spaces EandW. Use the fact that\nE/ba∇dblBt−Bs/ba∇dblβ\nW=/integraldisplay\nW/ba∇dblx/ba∇dblβ\nWµt−s(dx) = (t−s)β/2/integraldisplay\nW/ba∇dblx/ba∇dblβ\nWµ(dx)≤C(t−s)β/2\nby Fernique. In particular Btis, almost surely, uniformly continuous and so extends to a c ontinuous\nfunction on [0 ,∞).\nExercise 5.5. For anyf∈W∗,f(Bt) is a one-dimensional Brownian motion with variance q(f,f).\nIff1,f2,...areq-orthogonal, then the Brownian motions f1(Bt),f2(Bt),...are independent.\nQuestion 3. Ifhjis an orthonormal basis for H, andBj\ntis an iid sequence of one-dimensional\nstandard Brownian motions, does/summationtext∞\nj=1Bj\nthjconverge uniformly in W, almost surely, to a Brow-\nnian motion on W? That would be an even easier construction.\nExercise 5.6. LetW′=C([0,1],W) (which is aseparable Banach space) and consider themeasur e\nµ′onW′induced by {Bt,0≤t≤1}. Show that µ′is a Gaussian measure. For extra credit, ﬁnd a\nnice way to write its covariance form.\nExercise 5.7. SupposeW=C([0,1]) andµis the law of a one-dimensional continuous Gaussian\nprocessXswith covariance function a(s1,s2). LetYs,t=Bt(s) be the corresponding two-parameter\nprocess (note Btis a random element of C([0,1]) soBt(s) is a random variable). Show Ys,tis a\ncontinuous Gaussian process whose covariance function is\nE[Ys1,t1Ys2,t2] = (t1∧t2)a(s1,s2).\nIfXsis one-dimensional Brownian motion, then Ys,tis called the Brownian sheet .\nBthas essentially all the properties you would expect a Browni an motion to have. You can\nopen your favorite textbook on Brownian motion and pick most any theorem that applies to d-\ndimensional Brownian motion, and the proof should go throug h with minimal changes. We note a\nfew important properties here.\nProposition 5.8. Btis a Markov process, with transition probabilities Px(Bt∈A) =µx\nt(A) :=\nµ(t−1/2(A−x)).\nProof.The Markov property is immediate, because Bthas independent increments. Computing\nthe transition probabilities is also very simple.\n35\nProposition 5.9. Btis a martingale.\nProof.Obvious, because it has independent mean-zero increments.\nProposition 5.10. Btobeys the Blumenthal 0-1law: letFt=σ(Bs: 0≤s≤t)andF+\nt=/intersectiontext\ns>tFs.\nThenF+\n0isPx-almost trivial, i.e. for any A∈ F+\n0and anyx∈W,Px(A) = 0or1.\nProof.This holds for any continuous Markov process.\nThe transition semigroup of Btis\nPtF(x) =ExF(Bt) =/integraldisplay\nFµx\nt=/integraldisplay\nF(x+t1/2y)µ(dy)\nwhich makes sense for any bounded measurable function. Clea rlyPtis Markovian (positivity-\npreserving and a contraction with respect to the uniform nor m).\nNotation 5.11. LetCb(W) denote the space of bounded continuous functions F:W→R. Let\nCu(W) denote the subspace of bounded uniformly continuous functions.\nExercise 5.12. Cb(W) andCu(W) are Banach spaces.\nProposition 5.13. Ptis a Feller semigroup: if Fis continuous, so is PtF.\nProof.Fixx∈W, andǫ >0. Sinceµtis Radon (see Section B), there exists a compact Kwith\nµt(KC)<ǫ.\nFor anyz∈K, the function F(·+z) is continuous at x, so there exists δzsuch that for any\nuwith/ba∇dblu/ba∇dblW< δz, we have |F(x+z)−F(x+u+z)|< ǫ. The balls B(z,δz/2) coverKso we\ncan take a ﬁnite subcover B(zi,δi/2). Now suppose /ba∇dblx−y/ba∇dblW<minδi/2. For any z∈K, we may\nchooseziwithz∈B(zi,δi/2). We then have\n|F(x+z)−F(y+z)| ≤ |F(x+z)−F(x+zi)|+|F(x+zi)−F(y+z)|\n=|F((x+(z−zi))+zi)−F(x+zi)|\n+|F(x+zi)−F((x+(y−x)+(z−zi))+zi)|\nEach term is of the form |F(x+zi)−F(x+u+zi)|for someuwith/ba∇dblu/ba∇dblW< δi, and hence is\nbounded by ǫ.\nNow we have\n|PtF(x)−PtF(y)| ≤/integraldisplay\nW|F(x+z)−F(y+z)|µt(dz)\n=/integraldisplay\nK|F(x+z)−F(y+z)|µt(dz)+/integraldisplay\nKC|F(x+z)−F(y+z)|µt(dz)\n≤ǫ+2ǫ/ba∇dblF/ba∇dbl∞.\n36\nRemark 5.14.This shows that Ptis a contraction semigroup on Cb(W). We would really like to\nhaveastrongly continuouscontraction semigroup. However ,Ptisnot ingeneral stronglycontinuous\nonCb(W). Indeed, take the one-dimensional case W=R, and letf(x) = cos(x2), so thatfis\ncontinuous and bounded but not uniformly continuous. One ca n check that Ptfvanishes at inﬁnity,\nfor anyt. (For instance, take Fourier transforms, so the convolutio n inPtfbecomes multiplication.\nThe Fourier transform ˆfis just a scaled and shifted version of f; in particular it is bounded, so\n/hatwidestPtfis integrable. Then the Riemann–Lebesgue lemma implies tha tPtf∈C0(R). One can also\ncompute directly, perhaps by writing fas the real part of eix2.) Thus if Ptfwere to converge\nuniformly as t→0, the limit would also vanish at inﬁnity, and so could not be f. (In fact,Ptf→f\npointwise as t→0, soPtfdoes not converge uniformly.)\nRemark 5.15.One should note that the term “Feller semigroup” has several diﬀerent and incom-\npatible deﬁnitions in the literature, so caution is require d when invoking results from other sources.\nOne other common deﬁnition assumes the state space Xis locally compact, and requires that Pt\nbe a strongly continuous contraction semigroup on C0(X), the space of continuous functions “van-\nishing at inﬁnity”, i.e. the uniform closure of the continuo us functions with compact support. In\nour non-locally-compact setting this condition is meaning less, sinceC0(W) = 0.\nProposition 5.16. Bthas the strong Markov property.\nProof.This should hold for any Feller process. The proof in Durrett looks like it would work.\nTheorem 5.17. Ptis a strongly continuous contraction semigroup on Cu(W).\nProof.LetF∈Cu(W). We ﬁrst check that PtF∈Cu(W). It is clear that PtFis bounded;\nindeed,/ba∇dblPtF/ba∇dbl∞≤ /ba∇dblF/ba∇dbl∞. Fixǫ >0. There exists δ >0 such that |F(x)−F(y)|< ǫwhenever\n/ba∇dblx−y/ba∇dblW<δ. For suchx,ywe have\n|PtF(x)−PtF(y)| ≤/integraldisplay\n|F(x+z)−F(y+z)|µt(dz)≤ǫ.\nThusPtFis uniformly continuous.\nNext, we have\n|PtF(x)−F(x)| ≤/integraldisplay\n|F(x+t1/2y)−F(x)|µ(dy)\n=/integraldisplay\n/ba∇dblt1/2y/ba∇dblW<δ|F(x+t1/2y)−F(x)|µ(dy)+/integraldisplay\n/ba∇dblt1/2y/ba∇dblW≥δ|F(x+t1/2y)−F(x)|µ(dy)\n≤ǫ+2/ba∇dblF/ba∇dbl∞µ({y:/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddoublet1/2y/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble\nW≥δ}).\nButµ({y:/vextenddouble/vextenddoublet1/2y/vextenddouble/vextenddouble\nW≥δ}) =µ(B(0,t−1/2)C)→0 ast→0. So for small enough twe have\n|PtF(x)−F(x)| ≤2ǫindependent of x.\nRemark 5.18.Cu(X) is not the nicest Banach space to work with here; in particul ar it is not\nseparable, and its dual space is hard to describe. However, t he usual nice choices that work in\nﬁnite dimensions don’t help us here. In Rn,Ptis a strongly continuous semigroup on C0(Rn); but\nin inﬁnite dimensions C0(W) = 0.\nInRn,Ptis also a strongly continuous symmetric semigroup on L2(Rn,m), wheremis Lebesgue\nmeasure. In inﬁnite dimensions we don’t have Lebesgue measu re, but we might wonder whether µ\n37\ncould stand in: is Pta reasonable semigroup on L2(W,µ)? The answer is emphatically no; it is not\neven a well-deﬁned operator. First note that Pt1 = 1 for all t. Letei∈W∗beq-orthonormal, so\nthat under µtheeiare iidN(0,1). Underµtthey are iid N(0,t). Setsn(x) =1\nn/summationtextn\ni=1|ei(x)|2; by\nthe strong law of large numbers, sn→t,µt-a.e. LetA={x:sn(x)→1}, so 1A= 1µ-a.e. On the\nother hand, for any t>0,\n/integraldisplay\nWPt1A(x)µ(dx) =/integraldisplay\nW/integraldisplay\nW1A(x+y)µt(dy)µ(dx) = (µt∗µ)(A) =µ1+t(A) = 0.\nSincePt1A≥0, it must be that Pt1A= 0,µ-a.e. Thus 1 and 1 Aare the same element of L2(W,µ),\nbutPt1 andPt1Aare not.\nWe knew that Hwas “thin” in Win the sense that µ(H) = 0. In particular, this means that\nfor anyt,P(Bt∈H) = 0. Actually more is true.\nProposition 5.19. LetσH= inf{t>0 :Bt∈H}. Then for any x∈W,Px(σH=∞) = 1. That\nis, from any starting point, with probability one, BtneverhitsH. In other words, His polar for\nBt.\nProof.Fix 0< t1< t2<∞. Ifbtis a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion started at\n0, letc=P(inf{bt:t1≤t≤t2} ≥1), i.e. the probability that btis above 1 for all times\nbetweent1andt2. Clearlyc >0. By the strong Markov property it is clear that for x0>0,\nP(inf{bt+x0:t1≤t≤t2} ≥1)> c, and by symmetry P(sup{bt−x0:t1≤t≤t2} ≤ −1)> c\nalso. So for any x0∈R, we have\nP(inf{|bt+x0|2:t1≤t≤t2} ≥1)>c.\nFix aq-orthonormal basis {ek} ⊂W∗as in Lemma 4.21, so that Bt∈Hiﬀ/ba∇dblBt/ba∇dbl2\nH=/summationtext\nk|ek(Bt)|2<∞. Under Px,ek(Bt) are independent one-dimensional Brownian motions with\nvariance 1 and starting points ek(x). So if we let Akbe the event Ak={inf{|ek(Bt)|2:t1≤t≤\nt2} ≥1}, by the above computation we have Px(Ak)> c. Since the Akare independent we have\nPx(Aki.o.) = 1. But on the event {Aki.o}we have/ba∇dblBt/ba∇dbl2\nH=/summationtext∞\nk=1|ek(Bt)|2=∞for allt∈[t1,t2].\nThusPx-a.s.Btdoes not hit Hbetween times t1andt2. Now lett1↓0 andt2↑ ∞along sequences\nto get the conclusion.\nRemark 5.20.A priori it is not obvious that σH: Ω→[0,∞] is even measurable (its measurability\nit is deﬁned by an uncountable inﬁmum, and there is no apparen t way to reduce it to a countable\ninﬁmum), or that {σH=∞}is a measurable subset of Ω. What we really showed is that ther e\nis a (measurable) event A={Aki.o.}withPx(A) = 1 and σH=∞onA. If we complete the\nmeasurable space (Ω ,F) by throwing in all the sets which are Px-null for every x, then{σh=∞}\nwill be measurable and so will σH.\nIn the general theory of Markov processes one shows that unde r some mild assumptions, in-\ncluding the above completion technique, σBis indeed measurable for any Borel (or even analytic)\nsetB.\n6 Calculus on abstract Wiener space\nThe strongly continuous semigroup PtonCu(W) has a generator L, deﬁned by\nLf= lim\nt↓01\nt(Ptf−f).\n38\nThis is an unbounded operator on Cu(W) whose domain D(L) is the set of all ffor which the limit\nconverges in Cu(W). It is a general fact that Lis densely deﬁned and closed.\nIn the classical setting where W=Rnandµis standard Gaussian measure (i.e. q=/a\\}b∇acketle{t·,·/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htRn), so\nthatBtis standard Brownian motion, we know that L=−1\n2∆ is the Laplace operator, which sums\nthe second partial derivatives in all orthogonal direction s. Note that “orthogonal” is with respect\nto the Euclidean inner product, which is also the Cameron–Ma rtin inner product in this case.\nWe should expect that in the setting of abstract Wiener space ,Lshould again bea second-order\ndiﬀerential operator that should play the same role as the Lap lacian. So we need to investigate\ndiﬀerentiation on W.\nDeﬁnition 6.1. LetWbe a Banach space, and F:W→Ra function. We say FisFr´ echet\ndiﬀerentiable atx∈Wif there exists gx∈W∗such that, for any sequence W∋yn→0 in\nW-norm,\nF(x+yn)−F(x)−gx(yn)\n/ba∇dblyn/ba∇dblW→0.\ngxis the Fr´ echet derivative of Fatx. One could write F′(x) =gx. It may be helpful to think in\nterms of directional derivatives and write ∂yF(x) =F′(x)y=gx(y).\nExample 6.2. SupposeF(x) =φ(f1(x),...,fn(x)) is a cylinder function. Then\nF′(x) =n/summationdisplay\ni=1∂iφ(f1(x),...,fn(x))fi.\nAs it turns out, we will be most interested in diﬀerentiating i n directions h∈H, since in some\nsense that is really what the usual Laplacian does. Also, Fr´ echet diﬀerentiability seems to be too\nmuch to ask for; according to references in Kuo [14], the set o f continuously Fr´ echet diﬀerentiable\nfunctions is not dense in Cu(W).\nDeﬁnition 6.3.

If F∈L2(W,Fr), we can approximate FinL2\nby cylinder functions Fnof the above form. Then deﬁning un,uaccordingly we have un→u\ninL2(W;H) andδun→F·(Br−Bs) =/integraltext1\n0AτdBτinL2(W), so the conclusion holds for A=\nF(ω)1(r,s](t). By linearity it also holds for any linear combination of su ch processes. The set\nof such linear combinations is dense in the adapted processe s inL2([0,1]×W), so choose such\nA(n)→A.

We have u(t,ω) =tB1=h(t)G(ω) where\nh(t) =t, andG(ω) =φ(f(ω)) whereφ(x) =x, andf(ω) =ω(1). Soδu(ω) =G(ω)/a\\}b∇acketle{th,ω/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH−\n/a\\}b∇acketle{tDG(ω),h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH.

Indeed, a random variable is an\nadapted process iﬀ it is in F0, which means it has to be constant.\nAll the time derivatives and integrals here are sort of a red h erring; they just come from the\nfact that the Cameron–Martin inner product has a time deriva tive in it.\nAnother cool fact is that we can use this machinery to constru ct integration with respect to\nother continuous Gaussian processes. Again let W=C([0,1]) (or an appropriate subspace), µthe\nlaw of a continuous centered Gaussian process Xtwith covariance function a(s,t) =E[XsXt]. Since\nδapplies to elements of L2(W;H), and we want to integrate honest processes (such as element s\nofL2([0,1]×W)), we need some way to map processes to elements of L2(W;H). For Brownian\nmotion it was At/ma√sto→/integraltextt\n0Asds, an isometry of L2([0,1]×W) =L2(W;L2([0,1])) =L2(W)⊗L2([0,1])\nintoL2(W;H). To construct such an map Φ in this case, we start with the ide a that we want/integraltextt\n0dXs=Xt, so we should have Φ1 [0,T]=Jδs∈H. We can extend this map linearly to E, the set\nof all step functions on [0 ,1]. To make it an isometry, equip Ewith the inner product deﬁned by\n/a\\}b∇acketle{t1[0,s],1[0,t]/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htE=/a\\}b∇acketle{tJδs,Jδt/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH=a(s,t)\nagain extended by bilinearity. It extends isometrically to the completion of Eunder this inner\nproduct, whatever that may be. So the processes we can integr ate are we can integrate processes\nfromL2(W;¯E) =L2(W)⊗¯Ejust by taking/integraltext1\n0AdX=δuwhereu(ω) = Φ(A(ω)).\nExactly what are the elements of L2(W;¯E) is a little hard to say. The elements of ¯Ecan’t\nnecessarily be identiﬁed as functions on [0 ,1]; they might be distributions, for instance. But we for\nsure know it contains step functions, so L2(W;¯E) at least contains “simple processes” of the form/summationtextYi1[ai,bi](t). In the case of fractional Brownian motion, one can show tha t¯EcontainsL2([0,1]),\nso in particular Φ makes sense for any process in L2(W×[0,1]). Of course, there is still the question\nof whether Φ( A)∈domδ.\nThere’s a chapter in Nualart which works out a lot of this in th e context of fractional Brow-\nnian motion. Being able to integrate with respect to fBM is a b ig deal, because fBM is not a\nsemimartingale and so it is not covered by any version of Itˆ o integration.\nA couple of properties of δin terms of the Wiener chaos:\n1.Hn(H)⊂domδfor eachn.

Let{Bt}be a Brownian motion on Rd, let{Ft}be the ﬁltration it generates, and let\nZbe anL2random variable which is F1-measurable (sometimes called a Brownian functional ).\nThen there exists an adapted L2processYtsuch that\nZ=E[Z]+/integraldisplay1\n0YtdBt,a.s.\nSketch.This is claiming that the range of the Itˆ o integral contains all theL2random variables with\nmean zero (which we’ll denote H⊥\n0). Since the Itˆ o integral is an isometry, its range is automa tically\nclosed, so it suﬃces to show it is dense in H⊥\n0. One can explicitly produce a dense set.\nExercise 6.30. Look up a proof.\nAn important application of this theorem is in ﬁnance. Suppo se we have a stochastic process\n{Xt}which gives the price of a stock (call it Acme) at time t. (Temporarily you can think Xt=Bt\nis Brownian motion, though this is not a good model and we migh t improve it later.) We may want\nto study an optionorcontingent claim , some contract whose ultimate value Zis determined by\nthe behavior of the stock. For example:\n•AEuropean call option is a contract which gives you the right, but not the obligatio n,\nto buy one share of Acme at time 1 for a pre-agreed strike price K. So if the price X1at\ntime 1 is greater than K, you will exercise your option, buy a share for Kdollars, and then\nyou can immediately sell it for X1dollars, turning a quick proﬁt of Z=X1−Kdollars. If\nX1< K, then you should not exercise the option; it is worthless, an dZ= 0. Thus we can\nwriteZ= (X1−K)+.\n50\n•AEuropean put option gives the right to sell one share of Acme at a price K. Similarly\nwe haveZ= (K−X1)+.\n•Aﬂoating lookback put option gives one the right, at time 1, to sell one share of Acme\nat the highest price it ever attained between times 0 and 1. So Z= supt∈[0,1]Xt−X1.\n•There are many more.\nYou can’t lose money with these contracts, because you can al ways just not exercise it, and you\ncould gain a proﬁt. Conversely, your counterparty can only l ose money. So you are going to have\nto pay your counterparty some money up front to get them to ent er into such a contract. How\nmuch should you pay? A “fair” price would be E[Z]. But it may be that the contract would be\nworth more or less to you than that, depending on your appetit e for risk. (Say more about this.)\nHere the Itˆ o representation theorem comes to the rescue. If Xt=Btis a Brownian motion, it\nsays thatZ=E[Z]+/integraltext1\n0YtdBt. This represents a hedging strategy . Consider a trading strategy\nwhere at time twe want to own Ytshares of Acme (where we can hold or borrow cash as needed\nto achieve this; negative shares are also okay because we can sell short). Ytis adapted, meaning\nthe number of shares to own can be determined by what the stock has already done. A moment’s\nthought shows that the net value of your portfolio at time 1 is/integraltext1\n0YtdBt. Thus, if we start with\nE[Z] dollars in the bank and then follow the strategy Yt, at the end we will have exactly Zdollars,\nalmost surely. We can replicate the option ZforE[Z] dollars (not counting transaction costs,\nwhich we assume to be negligible). So anybody that wants more thanE[Z] dollars is ripping us oﬀ,\nand we shouldn’t pay it even if we would be willing to.\nSo a key question is whether we can explicitly ﬁnd Yt.\nIn Wiener space notation, Zis an element of L2(W,µ), which we had usually called F. Also,\nnowFtis theσ-algebra generated by the linear functionals {δs:s≤t}; since these span a weak-*\ndense subset of W∗we have F1=σ(W∗) =BW, the Borel σ-algebra of W.\nLetL2\na([0,1]×W) be the space of adapted processes.\nExercise 6.31. L2\na([0,1]×W) is a closed subspace of L2([0,1]×W).\nExercise 6.32. Yt/ma√sto→E[Yt|Ft] is orthogonal projection from L2([0,1]×W) ontoL2\na([0,1]×W).\nThis section is tangled up a bit by some derivatives coming an d going. Remember that H\nis naturally isomorphic to L2([0,1]) via the map Φ : L2([0,1])→Hgiven by Φf(t) =/integraltextt\n0f(s)ds\n(its inverse is simplyd\ndt). ThusL2(W;H) is naturally isomorphic to L2([0,1]×W). Under this\nidentiﬁcation, we can identify D:D1,2→L2(W;H) with a map that takes an element F∈D1,2to a\nprocessDtF∈L2([0,1]×W); namely,DtF(ω) =d\ndtDF(ω)(t) =d\ndt/a\\}b∇acketle{tDF(ω),Jδt/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH=d\ndt/a\\}b∇acketle{tDF(ω),·∧\nt/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH. SoDtF= Φ−1DF.\nThe Clark–Ocone theorem states:\nTheorem 6.33. ForF∈D1,2,\nF=/integraldisplay\nFdµ+/integraldisplay1\n0E[DtF|Ft]dBt. (6.5)\nTo prove this, we want to reduce everything to Skorohod integ rals. LetE⊂L2(W;H) be the\nimage ofL2\na([0,1]×W) under the isomorphism Φ. Then, since the Skorohod integral extends the\n51\nItˆ o integral, we know that E⊂domδ, andδ:E→L2(W) is an isometry. Moreover, by the\nItˆ o representation theorem, the image δ(E) is exactly H⊥\n0, i.e. the orthogonal complement of the\nconstants, i.e. functions with zero mean.\nLetPdenote orthogonal projection onto E, so that E[·|Ft] = Φ−1PΦ.\nWe summarize this discussion by saying that the following di agram commutes.\nL2([0,1]×W)E[·|Ft]/d47/d47\n/d75/d83\nΦ\n/d11/d19L2\na([0,1]×W)/d75/d83\nΦ\n/d11/d19/integraltext1\n0·dBt\n/d39/d39◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆\nD1,2Dt/d56/d56qqqqqqqqqqq\nD/d38/d38▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼ L2(W)\nL2(W;H)P/d47/d47Eδ/d55/d55♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣(6.6)\nFrom this diagram, we see that the Clark–Ocone theorem reads :\nF=/integraldisplay\nFdµ+δPDF.

If the stock price is Brownian motion ( Xt=Bt), compute the hedging strategy Yt\nfor a European call option Z= (X1−K)+.\nExercise 6.35. Again take Xt=Bt. Compute the hedging strategy for a ﬂoating lookback call\noptionZ=M−X1, whereM= supt∈[0,1]Xt. (Show that DtM= 1{t≤T}whereT= argmaxXt,\nwhich is a.s. unique, by approximating Mby the maximum over a ﬁnite set.)\nExercise 6.36. LetXtbe ageometric Brownian motion Xt= exp/parenleftbig\nBt−t\n2/parenrightbig\n. Compute the\nhedging strategy for a European call option Z= (X1−K)+. (Note by Itˆ o’s formula that dXt=\nXtdBt.)\n52\n7 Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process\nWe’ve constructed one canonical process on W, namely Brownian motion Bt, deﬁned by having\nindependent increments distributed according to µ(appropriately scaled). In ﬁnite dimensions,\nanother canonical process related to Gaussian measure is th eOrnstein–Uhlenbeck process .\nThis is a Gaussian process Xtwhich can be deﬁned by the SDE dXt=√\n2dBt−Xtdt. Intuitively,\nXttries to move like a Brownian motion, but it experiences a “re storing force” that always pulls\nit back toward the origin. Imagine a Brownian particle on a sp ring. A key relationship between\nXtand standard Gaussian measure µis thatXthasµas its stationary distribution: if we start Xt\nin a random position chosen according to µ, thenXtitself is also distributed according to µat all\nlater times. This also means that, from any starting distrib ution, the distribution of Xtconverges\ntoµast→ ∞.\nOne way to get a handle on the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, in ﬁnite or inﬁnite dimensions, is\nvia itsDirichlet form . Here are some basics on the subject.\n7.1 Crash course on Dirichlet forms\nSupposeXtis a symmetric Markov process on some topological space Xequipped with a Borel\nmeasurem. This means that its transition semigroup Ttf(x) =Ex[f(Xt)] is a Hermitian operator\nonL2(X,m). If we add a few extra mild conditions (e.g. c´ adl´ ag, stron g Markov) and make Xt\naHunt process , the semigroup Ttwill be strongly continuous. It is also Markovian , i.e. if\n0≤f≤1, then 0 ≤Ttf≤1. For example, if X=Rn,mis Lebesgue measure, and Xtis Brownian\nmotion, then Ttf(x) =1\n(2πt)n/2/integraltext\nRnf(y)e−|x−y|2/2tm(dy) is the usual heat semigroup.\nA strongly continuous contraction semigroup has an associa tedgenerator , a nonnegative-\ndeﬁnite self-adjoint operator ( L,D(L)) which in general is unbounded, such that Tt=e−tL. For\nBrownian motion it is L=−∆/2 withD(L) =H2(Rn).\nAssociated to a nonnegative self-adjoint operator is an unb ounded bilinear symmetric form E\nwith domain D, such that E(f,g) = (f,Lg) for every f∈Dandg∈D(L). We can take ( E,D) to\nbe a closed form, which essentially says that E1(f,g) =E(f,g)+(f,g) is a Hilbert inner product on\nD. Note that Dis generally larger than D(L). For Brownian motion, E(f,g) =/integraltext\nRn∇f·∇gdmand\nD=H1(Rn). NoteE1is the usual Sobolev inner product on H1(Rn).E(f,f) can be interpreted as\nthe amount of “energy” contained in the distribution fdm. Letting this distribution evolve under\nthe process will tend to reduce the amount of energy as quickl y as possible.\nWhenTtis Markovian, ( E,D) has a corresponding property, also called Markovian. Name ly,\niff∈D, let¯f=f∧1∨0 be a “truncated” version of f. The Markovian property asserts that\n¯f∈DandE(¯f,¯f)≤ E(f,f). A bilinear, symmetric, closed, Markovian form on L2(X,m) is called\naDirichlet form .\nSo far this is nice but not terribly interesting. What’s neat is that this game can be played\nbackwards. Under certain conditions, one can start with a Di richlet form and recover a Hunt\nprocess with which it is associated. This is great, because c onstructing a process is usually a lot of\nwork, but one can often just write down a Dirichlet form. More over, one ﬁnds that properties of\nthe process often have corresponding properties for the Dir ichlet form.\nFor example, if the process Xthas continuous sample paths, the form ( E,D) will be local:\nnamely, iff= 0 on the support of g, thenE(f,g) = 0. Conversely, if the form is local, then the\nassociated process will have continuous sample paths. If ad ditionally the process is not killed inside\n53\nX, the form is strongly local : iffis constant on the support of g, thenE(f,g) = 0; and the\nconverse is also true.\nSo you might ask: under what conditions must a Dirichlet form be associated with a process?\nOne suﬃcient condition is that ( E,D) beregular: thatD∩Cc(X) isE1-dense in Dand uniformly\ndense inCc(X). We also have to assume that X, as a topological space, is locally compact. The\nmain purposeof this condition is to exclude the possibility thatXcontains “holes” that the process\nwould have to pass through. Unfortunately, this condition i s useless in inﬁnite dimensions, since if\nX=Wis, say, an inﬁnite-dimensional Banach space, then Cc(W) = 0.\nThere is a more general condition called quasi-regular , which is actually necessary and suﬃ-\ncient for the existence of a process. It is suﬃciently compli cated that I won’t describe it here; see\nMa and R¨ ockner’s book for the complete treatment.\n7.2 The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck Dirichlet form\nWe are going to deﬁne the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process via its Dirichlet form. For F,G∈D1,2, let\nE(F,G) =/a\\}b∇acketle{tDF,DG/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htL2(W;H). This form is obviously bilinear, symmetric, and positive s emideﬁnite.\nWith the domain D1,2,Eis also a closed form (in fact, E1is exactly the Sobolev inner product on\nD1,2, which we know is complete).\nProposition 7.1. (E,D1,2)is Markovian.\nProof.Fixǫ>0. Letϕn∈C∞(R) bea sequence of smooth functions with 0 ≤ϕn≤1,|ϕ′\nn| ≤1+ǫ,\nandϕn(x)→x∧1∨0 pointwise. (Draw a picture to convince yourself this is pos sible.) Then\nϕn(F)→F∧1∨0 inL2(W) by dominated convergence. Then, by the chain rule, for F∈D1,2, we\nhave/ba∇dblDϕn(F)/ba∇dblL2(W;H)=/ba∇dblϕ′\nn(F)DF/ba∇dblL2(W;H)≤(1 +ǫ)/ba∇dblDF/ba∇dblL2(W;H). It follows from Alaoglu’s\ntheorem that F∧1∨0∈D1,2, and moreover, /ba∇dblD[F∧1∨0]/ba∇dblL2(W;H)≤(1+ǫ)/ba∇dblDF/ba∇dblL2(W;H). Letting\nǫ→0 we are done.\nExercise 7.2. Fill in the details in the preceding proof.\nTheorem 7.3. (E,D1,2)is quasi-regular. Therefore, there exists a Hunt process Xtwhose transition\nsemigroup is Tt, the semigroup corresponding to (E,D1,2).\nProof.See [15, IV.4.b].\nLemma 7.4. The operator Dislocalin the sense that for any F∈D1,2,DF= 0µ-a.e. on\n{F= 0}.\nProof.Letϕn∈C∞\nc(R) haveϕn(0) = 1, 0 ≤ϕn≤1, andϕnsupported inside/bracketleftbig\n−1\nn,1\nn/bracketrightbig\n; note\nthatϕn→1{0}pointwise and boundedly.

Since dom δis dense in L2(W;H), we have\n1{F=0}DF= 0µ-a.e., which is the desired statement.\n54\nCorollary 7.5. The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck Dirichlet form (E,D1,2)is strongly local.\nProof.LetF,G∈D1,2. Suppose ﬁrst that F= 0 on the support of G. By the previous lemma we\nhave (up to µ-null sets) {DF= 0} ⊃ {F= 0} ⊃ {G/\\e}atio\\slash= 0} ⊃ {DG/\\e}atio\\slash= 0}.

To get a better understanding of this process, we’ll study TtandNsome more.\nThe ﬁnite-dimensional Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator is giv en by\n˜Nφ(x) = ∆φ(x)−x·∇φ(x).\nThe same formula essentially works in inﬁnite dimensions.\n56\nLemma 7.13.

Note forﬁnitedimensions, ifwetake e1,...,entobethecoordinate\nfunctions on Rn, this shows that ˜Nreally is the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator.\nTheorem 7.14.

The interested reader can\nwork it out and let me know how it went.\nThis shows that at time t,Xtstarted atxhas a Gaussian distribution (derived from µ) with\nmeane−txand variance 1 −e−2t.\nHere is a general property of Markovian semigroups that we wi ll use later:\nLemma 7.15. For bounded nonnegative functions F,G, we have\n|Tt(FG)(x)|2≤Tt(F2)(x)Tt(G2)(x).

Note everything is with respect to Lebesgue measure. In par ticular, this says\nthat ifφand∇φare both in Lp, then the integrability of φis actually better: we have φ∈Lp∗. So\nW1,p⊂Lp∗\nand the inclusion is continuous (actually, if the inclusion holds at all it has to be continuous, by\nthe closed graph theorem).\nThis theorem is useless in inﬁnite dimensions in two diﬀerent ways. First, it involves Lebesgue\nmeasure, which doesn’t exist. Second, when n=∞we getp∗=pso the conclusion is a triviality\nanyway.\nIn 1975, Len Gross discovered the logarithmic Sobolev inequ ality [11] which ﬁxes both of these\ndefects by using Gaussian measure and being dimension-inde pendent. Thus it has a chance of\nholding in inﬁnite dimensions. In fact, it does.\nThe log-Sobolev inequality says that in an abstract Wiener s pace, forF∈D1,2with\n/integraldisplay\n|F|2ln|F|dµ≤ /ba∇dblF/ba∇dbl2\nL2(W,µ)ln/ba∇dblF/ba∇dblL2(W,µ)+/ba∇dblDF/ba∇dbl2\nL2(W;H). (7.6)\nIf you are worried what happens for Fnear 0:\nExercise 7.16. g(x) =x2lnxis bounded below on (0 ,∞), andg(x)→0 asx↓0.\nSo if we deﬁne “02ln0 = 0”, there is no concern about the existence of the integr al on the left\nside (however, what is not obvious is that it is ﬁnite). What’ s really of interest are the places where\n|F|is large, since then |F|2ln|F|is bigger than |F|2.\nIt’sworthnotingthat(7.6)alsoholdsinﬁnitedimensions, buttherearenodimension-dependent\nconstants appearing in it.\n58\nA concise way of stating the log Sobolev inequality is to say t hat\nD1,2⊂L2lnL\nwhereL2lnL, by analogy with Lp, represents the set of measurable functions Fwith/integraltext\n|F|2ln|F|<\n∞. This is called an Orlicz space; one can play this game to deﬁn eφ(L) spaces for a variety of\nreasonable functions φ.\nOur proof of the log Sobolev inequality hinges on the followi ng completely innocuous looking\ncommutation relation.\nLemma 7.17.

(Not necessarily very interesting) Characterize the set of Ffor which the foregoing\nidentity makes sense and is true.\nWe can now prove the log Sobolev inequality (7.6). This proof is taken from [19] which actually\ncontains several proofs.\nProof.First, letFbe a smooth cylinder function which is bounded above and boun ded below away\nfrom 0: 0< a≤F≤b <∞. TakeG=F2;Ghas the same properties. Note in particular that\nG∈domN. We have\nQ:= 2/parenleftbigg/integraldisplay\nF2lnFdµ−/ba∇dblF/ba∇dbl2ln/ba∇dblF/ba∇dbl/parenrightbigg\n=/integraldisplay\nGlnGdµ−/integraldisplay\nGdµln/integraldisplay\nGdµ. (7.8)\nand we want to bound this quantity Qby 2/ba∇dblDF/ba∇dbl2\nL2(W;H).\nNote that for any G∈L2(W) we have lim t→∞TtG=J0G=/integraltext\nGdµ. (Use Lemma 7.11\nand monotone convergence.) So we can think of TtGas a continuous function from [0 ,∞] to\nL2(W). It is continuously diﬀerentiable on (0 ,∞) and has derivative −NTtG=−TtNG. So deﬁne\nA: [0,∞]→L2(W)byA(t) = (TtG)·(lnTtG)(notingthatas TtisMarkovian, TtGisboundedabove\nand below, so ( TtG)·(lnTtG) is also bounded and hence in L2). ThenQ=/integraltext\nW(A(0)−A(∞))dµ.\nSince we want to use the fundamental theorem of calculus, we u se the chain rule to see that\nA′(t) =−(NTtG)(1+lnTtG).\nSo by the fundamental theorem of calculus, we have\nQ=−/integraldisplay\nW/integraldisplay∞\n0A′(t)dtdµ\n=/integraldisplay\nW/integraldisplay∞\n0(NTtG)(1+lnTtG)dtdµ.\nThere are two integrals in this expression, so of course we wa nt to interchange them. To justify\nthis, we note that 1+ln TtGis bounded (since 0 <a2≤G≤b2andTtis Markovian, we also have\na2≤TtG≤b2)), and so it is enough to bound\n/integraldisplay\nW/integraldisplay∞\n0|NTtG|dtdµ=/integraldisplay∞\n0/ba∇dblNTtG/ba∇dblL1(W,µ)dt\n≤/integraldisplay∞\n0/ba∇dblNTtG/ba∇dblL2(W,µ)dt\nsince/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblL1≤ /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblL2over a probability measure (Cauchy–Schwarz or Jensen). Not e thatNTtG=\nTtNGis continuous from [0 ,∞] toL2(W,µ), so/ba∇dblNTtG/ba∇dblL2(W)is continuous in tand hence bounded\non compact sets. So we only have to worry about what happens fo r larget. But Corollary 7.12\nsays that it decays exponentially, and so is integrable.

This is what we\nwanted.\nToextendthistoall F∈D1,2, weneedsomedensityarguments. Supposenowthat Fisasmooth\ncylinder function which is bounded, say |F| ≤M.

Since ϕn(F)→ |F|pointwise and boundedly, we have /ba∇dblϕn(F)/ba∇dblL2(W)→\n/ba∇dblF/ba∇dblL2(W)by dominated convergence. We also have, by the chain rule, /ba∇dblDϕn(F)/ba∇dblL2(W;H)≤(1+\nǫ)/ba∇dblDF/ba∇dblL2(W;H). Thus\nlimsup\nn→∞/integraldisplay\nWϕn(F)2lnϕn(F)dµ≤ /ba∇dblF/ba∇dbl2ln/ba∇dblF/ba∇dbl+(1+ǫ)/ba∇dblDF/ba∇dbl2.\nNow sincex2lnxis continuous, we have ϕn(F)2lnϕn(F)→ |F|2ln|F|pointwise. Since x2lnxis\nbounded below, Fatou’s lemma gives\n/integraldisplay\nW|F|2ln|F|dµ≤liminf\nn→∞/integraldisplay\nWϕn(F)2lnϕn(F)dµ\nand so this case is done after we send ǫ→0. (Dominated convergence could also have been used,\nwhich would give equality in the last line.)\nFinally, let F∈D1,2. We can ﬁnd a sequence of bounded cylinder functions Fnsuch that\nFn→FinL2(W) andDFn→DFinL2(W;H). Passing to a subsequence, we can also assume\nthatFn→F µ-a.e., and we use Fatou’s lemma as before to see that the log So bolev inequality\nholds in the limit.\nNote that we mostly just used properties that are true for any Markovian semigroup Ttthat\nis conservative ( Tt1 = 1). The only exception was the commutation DTt=e−tTtD. In fact, an\ninequality like /ba∇dblDTtF/ba∇dblH≤C(t)Tt/ba∇dblDF/ba∇dblHwould have been good enough, provided that C(t) is\nappropriately integrable. (One of the main results in my the sis was to prove an inequality like this\nfor a certain ﬁnite-dimensional Lie group, in order to obtai n a log-Sobolev inequality by precisely\nthis method.)\nAlso, you might wonder: since the statement of the log-Sobol ev inequality only involved Dand\nµ, why did we drag the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck semigroup into it? R eally the only reason was the\nfact thatT∞F=/integraltext\nFdµ, which is just saying that Ttis the semigroup of a Markov process whose\ndistribution at a certain time t0(we tookt0=∞) is the measure µwe want to use. If we want\nto prove this theorem in ﬁnite dimensions, we could instead u se the heat semigroup Pt(which is\nsymmetric with respect to Lebesgue measure) and take t= 1, beak Brownian motion at time 1 also\nhas a standard Gaussian distribution.\n8 Absolute continuity and smoothness of distributions\nThis section will just hint at some of the very important appl ications of Malliavin calculus to\nproving absolute continuity results.\nWhen presented with a random variable (or random vector) X, a very basic question is “What\nis its distribution?”, i.e. what is ν(A) :=P(X∈A) for Borel sets A? A more basic question is\n“DoesXhas a continuous distribution?”, i.e. is νabsolutely continuous to Lebesgue measure?\nIf so, it has a Radon–Nikodym derivative f∈L1(m), which is a density function for X. It may\nhappen that fis continuous or CkorC∞, in which case so much the better.\nGiven a Brownian motion Btor similar process, one can cook up lots of complicated rando m\nvariables whose distributions may be very hard to work out. F or example:\n62\n•X=f(Bt) for some ﬁxed t(this is not so hard)\n•X=f(BT) for some stopping time T\n•X= supt∈[0,1]Bt\n•X=/integraltext1\n0YtdBt\n•X=Zt, whereZis the solution to some SDE dZt=f(Zt)dBt.\nMalliavin calculus gives us some tools to learn something ab out the absolute continuity of such\nrandom variables, and the smoothness of their densities.\nLet (W,H,µ) bean abstract Wiener space. A measurable function F:W→Ris then a random\nvariable, and we can ask about its distribution. If we’re goi ng to use Malliavin calculus, we’d better\nconcentrate on F∈D1,p. An obvious obstruction to absolute continuity would be if Fis constant\non some set Aof positiveµ-measure; in this case, as we have previously shown, DF= 0 onA. The\nfollowing theorem says if we ensure that DFdoesn’t vanish, then Fmust be absolutely continuous.\nTheorem 8.1. LetF∈D1,1, and suppose that DFis nonzeroµ-a.e. Then the law of Fis absolutely\ncontinuous to Lebesgue measure.\nProof.Letν=µ◦F−1be the law of F; our goal is to show ν≪m.\nByreplacing Fwithsomethinglikearctan( F), wecanassumethat Fisbounded; say0 ≤F≤1.\nSo we want to show that νis absolutely continuous to Lebesgue measure mon [0,1]. LetA⊂[0,1]\nbe Borel with m(A) = 0; we want to show ν(A) = 0.\nChoose a sequence gn∈C∞([0,1]) such that gn→1Am+ν-a.e., and such that the gnare\nuniformly bounded (say |gn| ≤2). Setψn(t) =/integraltextt\n0gn(s)ds. Thenψn∈C∞,|ψn| ≤2, andψn→0\npointwise (everywhere).\nIn particular ψn(F)→0µ-a.e. (in fact everywhere), and thus also in L1(W,µ) by bounded\nconvergence. On the other hand, by the chain rule, Dψn(F) =gn(F)DF. Now since gn→1A\nν-a.e., we have gn(F)→1A(F)µ-a.e., and boundedly. Thus gn(F)DF→1A(F)DFinL1(W;H).\nNowDis a closed operator, so we must have 1 A(F)DF=D0 = 0. But by assumption DF/\\e}atio\\slash= 0\nµ-a.e., so we have to have 1 AF= 0µ-a.e., that is, ν(A) = 0.\nSo knowing that the derivative DF“never” vanishes guarantees that the law of Fhas a density.\nIfDFmostly stays away from zero in the sense that /ba∇dblDF/ba∇dbl−1\nH∈Lp(W) for somep, then this gives\nmore smoothness (e.g. diﬀerentiability) for the density. Se e Nualart for precise statements.\nIn higher dimensions, if we have a function F= (F1,...,Fn) :W→Rn, the object to\nlook at is the “Jacobian,” the matrix-valued function γF:W→Rn×ndeﬁned by γF(x)ij=\n/a\\}b∇acketle{tDFi(x),DFj(x)/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH. IfγFis almost everywhere nonsingular, then the law of Fhas a density. If\nwe have (det γF)−1∈Lp(W) for somep, then we get more smoothness.\nHere’s another interesting fact. Recall that the support of a Borel measure νon a topological\nspace Ω is by deﬁnition the set of all x∈Ω such that every neighborhood of xhas nonzero ν\nmeasure. This set is closed.\nProposition 8.2. IfF∈D1,2, then the support of the law of Fis connected, i.e. is a closed\ninterval in R.\n63\nProof.Letν=µ◦F−1. Suppose supp νis not connected. Then there exists a∈Rsuch that there\nare points of supp νto the left and right of a. Since supp νis closed, there is an open interval ( a,b)\nin the complement of supp ν. That is, we have µ(a<F <b ) = 0 but 0 <µ(F≤a)<1. Letψ∈\nC∞(R) haveψ(t) = 1 fort≤aandψ(t) = 0 fort≥b, and moreover take ψand all its derivatives\nto be bounded. Then ψ(F) = 1(−∞,a](F) = 1{F≤a}. Sinceψis smooth, 1 {F≤a}=ψ(F)∈D1,2by\nthe chain rule (Lemma 6.24). By the zero-one law of Propositi on 6.25,µ(F≤a) is either 0 or 1, a\ncontradiction.\nAs an example, let’s look at the maximum of a continuous proce ss.\nLet (W,H,µ) be an abstract Wiener space. Suppose we have a process {Xt:t∈[0,1]}deﬁned\nonW, i.e. a measurable map X: [0,1]×W→R, which is a.s. continuous in t. (If we take\nW=C([0,1]) andµthe law of some continuous Gaussian process Yt, thenXt=Yt, in other words\nXt(ω) =ω(t), would be an example. Another natural example would be to ta ke classical Wiener\nspace and let Xtbe the solution of some SDE.) Let M= supt∈[0,1]Xt. We will show that under\ncertain conditions, Mhas an absolutely continuous law.\n(Note you can also index {Xt}by any other compact metric space Sand the below proofs will\ngo through just ﬁne. If you take Sﬁnite, the results are trivial. You can take S= [0,1]2and\nprove things about Brownian sheet. You can even take Sto be Cantor space if you really want (hi\nClinton!).)\nLemma 8.3. SupposeFn∈D1,2,Fn→FinL2(W), andsupn/ba∇dblDFn/ba∇dblL2(W;H)<∞. ThenF∈D1,2\nandDFn→DFweakly inL2(W;H).\nProof.This is really a general fact about closed operators on Hilbe rt space. Since {DFn}is a\nbounded sequence in L2(W;H), by Alaoglu’s theorem we can pass to a subsequence and as-\nsume that DFnconverges weakly in L2(W;H), to some element u. Suppose v∈domδ. Then\n/a\\}b∇acketle{tDFn,v/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htL2(W;H)=/a\\}b∇acketle{tFn,δv/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htL2(W).

Since the left side is continuous in v, we haveF∈domδ∗= domD=D1,2. More-\nover, since we have /a\\}b∇acketle{tDFn,v/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht → /a\\}b∇acketle{tDF,v/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htfor allvin a dense subset of L2(W;H), and{DFn}is\nbounded, it follows from the triangle inequality that DFn→DFweakly. Since we get the same\nlimit no matter which weakly convergent subsequence we pass ed to, it must be that the original\nsequenceDFnalso converges weakly to DF.\nRecall, as we’ve previously argued, that if F∈D1,2, then|F| ∈D1,2also, and /ba∇dblD|F|/ba∇dblH≤\n/ba∇dblDF/ba∇dblHa.e. (Approximate |t|by smooth functions with uniformly bounded derivatives.) I t follows\nthat ifF1,F2∈D1,2, thenF1∧F2,F1∨F2∈D1,2also. (F1∧F2=F1+F2− |F1−F2|, and\nF1∨F2=F1+F2+|F1−F2|.) Then by iteration, if F1,...,F n∈D1,2, then min kFk,maxkFk∈D1,2\nas well.\nLemma 8.4. SupposeX,Mare as above, and:\n1./integraltext\nWsupt∈[0,1]|Xt(ω)|2µ(dω)<∞;\n2. For any t∈[0,1],Xt∈D1,2;\n3.

By the local property of D, we\nhaveDMn=DXqka.e. onAk. In particular, /ba∇dblDMn/ba∇dblH≤supt∈[0,1]/ba∇dblDXt/ba∇dblHa.e. Squaring and\nintegrating both sides, we are done by the last assumption.\nExercise 8.5. Let{Xt,t∈[0,1]}be a continuous centered Gaussian process. Then we can take\nW=C([0,1]) (or a closed subspace thereof) and µto be the law of the process, and deﬁne Xton\nWbyXt(ω) =ω(t). Verify that the hypotheses of Proposition 8.4 are satisﬁe d.\nProposition 8.6. SupposeXtsatisﬁes the hypotheses of the previous theorem, and moreov er\nµ({ω:Xt(ω) =M(ω) =⇒DXt(ω)/\\e}atio\\slash= 0}) = 1.\n(Note we are ﬁxing continuous versions of XtandDXtso the above expression makes sense.)

(Note that for every ﬁxed ω,M(ω) =Xt(ω) for somet.)\nLetEbe a countable dense subset of H.

If we let M′= supt∈(r,s)Xt,M′\nn= max{Xq1,...,X qn},\nthen as we argued before, M′\nn→M′inL2(W), andDM′\nn→DM′weakly inL2(W;H). On the\nother hand, by the local property used before, for every ωthere is some tiwithDM′\nn=DXti.\nThus forω∈Gr,s,h,kwe have /a\\}b∇acketle{tDM′\nn(ω)−DM′(ω),h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htH≥1\nnfor allr < t < s .

Again letXtbe a centered Gaussian process as in Exercise 8.5 above. Give an\nexample of a process for which Mdoes not have an absolutely continuous law. However, show th at\nifP(M= 0) = 0, then the hypothesis of Proposition 8.6 is satisﬁed. ( Can we show this always\nholds whenever Xtis strong Markov?)\nA Miscellaneous lemmas\nLemma A.1. Lety∈R∞, and suppose that/summationtexty(i)g(i)converges for every g∈ℓ2. Theny∈ℓ2.\nProof.For eachn, letHn∈(ℓ2)∗be the bounded linear functional Hn(g) =/summationtextn\ni=1y(i)g(i). By\nassumption, for each g∈ℓ2, the sequence {Hn(g)}converges; in particular supn|Hn(g)|<∞.\nSo by the uniform boundedness principle, supn||Hn||(ℓ2)∗<∞. But||Hn||2\n(ℓ2)∗=/summationtextn\ni=1|y(i)|2, so/summationtext∞\ni=1|y(i)|2= supn||Hn||2\n(ℓ2)∗<∞andy∈ℓ2.\nFor an elementary, constructive proof, see also [17].\nLemma A.2. LetHbe a separable Hilbert space and E⊂Ha dense subspace. There exists an\northonormal basis {ei}forHwith{ei} ⊂E.\nProof.Choose a sequence {xi} ⊂Ewhich is dense in H. (To see that this is possible, let {yk}\nbe a countable dense subset of H, and choose one xiinside each ball B(yk,1/m).) Then apply\nGram-Schmidt to xito get an orthonormal sequence {ei} ⊂Ewithxn∈span{e1,...,en}. Then\nsince{xi} ⊂span{ei}, span{ei}is dense in H, so{ei}is an orthonormal basis for H.\nLemma A.3. LetXn∼N(0,σ2\nn)be a sequence of mean-zero Gaussian random variables conver ging\nin distribution to a ﬁnite random variable X. ThenXis also Gaussian, with mean zero and variance\nσ2= limσ2\nn(and the limit exists).\nProof.Supposeσ2\nnkis asubsequenceof σ2\nnconverging to some σ2∈[0,+∞]. (By compactness, such\na subsequence must exist.) Now taking Fourier transforms, w e havee−λ2σ2\nn/2=E[eiλXn]→E[eiλX]\nfor eachX, soE[eiλX] =e−λ2σ2/2. Moreover, the Fourier transform of Xmust be continuous and\nequal 1 atλ= 0, which rules out the case σ2= +∞. SoX∼N(0,σ2). Since we get the same σ2\nno matter which convergent subsequence of σ2\nnwe start with, σ2\nnmust converge to σ2.\nLemma A.4. Letµbe any ﬁnite Borel measure on [0,1]. ThenC∞([0,1])is dense in Lp([0,1],µ).\nProof.Use Dynkin’s multiplicative system theorem. Let Mconsist of all µ-versions of all bounded\nmeasurablefunctionsintheclosureof C∞inLp(µ). ThenMis avector spaceclosed underbounded\nconvergence (since bounded convergence implies Lp(µ) convergence) and it contains C∞([0,1]). By\nDynkin’s theorem, Mcontains all bounded F-measurable functions, where Fis the smallest σ-\nalgebra that makes all functions from C∞([0,1]) measurable. But the identity function f(x) =x\nis inC∞. So for any Borel set B, we must have B=f−1(B)∈ F. ThusFis actually the Borel\nσ-algebra, and Mcontains all bounded measurable functions. Since the bound ed functions are\ncertainly dense in Lp(µ) (by dominated convergence), we are done.\n66\nB Radon measures\nDeﬁnition B.1. A ﬁnite Borel measure µon a topological space Wis said to be Radonif for\nevery Borel set B, we have\nµ(B) = sup{µ(K) :K⊂B,Kcompact} (B.1)\n(we say that such a set Bisinner regular ). Equivalently, µis Radon if for every Borel set Band\neveryǫ>0, there exists a compact K⊂Bwithµ(B\\K)<ǫ.\nProposition B.2. IfXis a compact metric space, every ﬁnite Borel measure on Xis Radon.\nProof.Let (X,d) be a compact metric space, and µa Borel measure. Let Fdenote the collection\nof all Borel sets Bsuch thatBandBCare both inner regular. I claim Fis aσ-algebra. Clearly\n∅ ∈ FandFis also closed under complements. If B1,B2,··· ∈ Fare disjoint, and B=/uniontext\nnBnthen\nsince/summationtext\nnµ(Bn) =µ(B)<∞, there exists nso large that/summationtext∞\nn=Nµ(Bn)< ǫ. Forn= 1,...,N,\nchoose a compact Kn⊂Bnwithµ(Bn\\Kn)<ǫ/N. Then ifK=/uniontextN\nn=1Kn,Kis compact, K⊂B,\nandµ(B\\K)<2ǫ. SoBis inner regular.\nNext,Fcontains all open sets U. For any open set Umay be written as a countable union\nof compact sets Kn. (For every x∈Uthere is an open ball B(x,rx) contained in U, hence\nB(x,rx/2)⊂Ualso. Since Xis second countable we can ﬁnd a basic open set Vxwithx∈Vx⊂\nB(x,rx/2), soVx⊂U. ThenU=/uniontext\nx∈UVx. But this union actually contains only countably many\ndistinct sets.) Thus by countable additivity, Uis inner regular. UCis compact and so obviously\ninner regular. Thus U∈ F. SinceFis aσ-algebra and contains all open sets, it contains all Borel\nsets.\nProposition B.3. Every complete separable metric space (X,d)is homeomorphic to a Borel subset\nof the compact metric space [0,1]∞.\nProof.Without loss of generality, assume d≤1. Fix a dense sequence x1,x2,...inXand for\neachx∈X, setF(x) = (d(x,x1),d(x,x2),...)∈[0,1]∞. It is easy to check that Fis continuous.\nFis also injective: for any x∈Xwe can choose a subsequence xnk→x, so thatd(xnk,x)→0.\nThen ifF(x) =F(y), thend(xn,x) =d(xn,y) for alln, soxnk→yas well, and x=y. Finally,\nFhas a continuous inverse. Suppose F(ym)→F(y). Choose an xnsuch thatd(xn,y)< ǫ. We\nhaveF(ym)n=d(xn,ym)→d(xn,y) =F(y)n, so for suﬃciently large m,d(ym,xn)< ǫ, and by\nthe triangle inequality d(ym,y)<2ǫ.\nLastly, we check F(X) is Borel. Well, this theorem is standard and I’m too lazy to w rite it out.\nSee, e.g. Srivastava’s A course on Borel sets , section 2.2.\nCorollary B.4. Any ﬁnite Borel measure µon a complete separable metric space Xis Radon.\nProof.LetFbe the above embedding of Xinto [0,1]∞. Thenµ◦F−1deﬁnes a Borel measure on\nF(X). We can extend it to a Borel measure on [0 ,1]∞by setting ˜µ(B) =µ(F−1(B∩F(X))), i.e.\n˜µassigns measure zero to all sets outside F(X). Then we know that ˜ µis Radon and hence so is\nµ.\nExercise B.5. As a corollary of this, for any Borel probability measure on a Polish space, there is\na sequence of compact sets Knsuch thatµ(/uniontextKn) = 1. This is perhaps surprising because compact\nsets in an inﬁnite dimensional Banach space are very thin; in particular they are nowhere dense.\nFor classical Wiener space with Wiener measure, ﬁnd explici t setsKnwith this property. (Hint:\nThink of some well-known sample path properties of Brownian motion.)\n67\nC Miscellaneous Exercises\nExercise C.1.

  "normalized_text": "arxiv:1607.03591v2 [math.pr] 7 sep 2016analysis and probability on infinite-dimensional spaces nathaniel eldredge september 8, 2016 preface i wrote these lecture notes for a graduate topics course i tau ght at cornell university in fall 2011 (math 7770). the ostensible primary goal of the course was fo r the students to learn some of the fundamental results and techniques in the study of proba bility on infinite-dimensional spaces, particularly gaussian measures on banach spaces (also know n as abstract wiener spaces). as others who have taught such courses will understand, a nontr ivial secondary goal of the course was for the instructor (i.e., me) to do the same. these notes only scratch the very surface of the subject, but i tried to use them to work through some of the basics and se e how they fit together into a bigger picture. in addition to theorems and proofs, i’ve lef t in some more informal discussions that attempt to develop intuition. most of the material here comes from the books [14, 16, 2], and the lecture notes prepared by bruce driver for the 2010 cornell probability summer school [4, 5]. if you are looking to learn more, these are great places to look.1 any text marked question n is something that i found myself wondering while writing thi s, butdidn’tever resolve. i’mnot proposingthem as openprobl ems; theanswerscould bewell-known, just not by me. if you know the answer to any of them, i’d be happ y to hear about it! there are also still a few places where proofs are rough or have some gap s that i never got around to filling in. on the other hand, something marked exercise n is really meant as an exercise. i would like to take this opportunity to thank the graduate st udents who attended the course. these notes were much improved by their questions and contri butions. i’d also like to thank several colleagues who sat in on the course or otherwise contributed to these notes, particularly clinton conley, bruce driver, leonard gross, ambar sengupta, and be njamin steinhurst. obviously, the many deficiencies in these notes are my responsibility and no t theirs. questions and comments on these notes are most welcome. i am n ow at the university of northern colorado, and you can email me at neldredge@unco.edu . 1in reading these notes in conjunction with [16], you should i dentify nualart’s abstract probability space (ω ,f,p) with our banach space ( w,b,μ). his “gaussian process” h/mapsto→w(h) should be viewed as corresponding to our map tdefined in section 4.3; his indexing hilbert space hmay be identified with the cameron–martin space, and his w(h) is the random variable, defined on the banach space, that we h ave denoted by thor/angbracketlefth,·/angbracketright. there’s a general principle in this area that all the “action” takes place on th e cameron–martin space, so one doesn’t really lose much by dropping the banach space structure on the space wand replacing it with an generic ω (and moreover generality is gained). nonetheless, i found it helpful in building intu ition to work on a concrete space w; this also gives one the opportunity to explore how the topologies of wandhinteract. 1 1 introduction 1.1 why analysis and probability on rnis nice classically, real analysis is usually based on the study of r eal-valued functions on finite-dimensional euclidean space rn, and operations on those functions involving limits, differe ntiation, and integration. why is rnsuch a nice space for this theory? •rnis a nice topological space, so limits behave well. specifica lly, it is a complete separable metric space, and it’s locally compact. •rnhas a nice algebraic structure: it’s a vector space, so trans lation and scaling make sense. this is where differentiation comes in: the derivative of a fun ction just measures how it changes under infinitesimal translation. •rnhas a natural measure space structure; namely, lebesgue mea suremon the borel σalgebra. the most important property of lebesgue measure is that it is invariant under translation. this leads to nice interactions between differe ntiation and integration, such as integration by parts, and it gives nice functional-analyti c properties to differentiation operators: for instance, the laplacian ∆ is a self-adjoint operat or on the hilbert space l2(rn,m). of course, a lot of analysis only involves local properties, and so it can be done on spaces that are locally like rn: e.g. manifolds. let’s set this idea aside for now. 1.2 why infinite-dimensional spaces might be less nice the fundamental idea in this course will be: how can we do anal ysis when we replace rnby an infinite dimensional space? first we should ask: what sort of space should we use? separable banach spaces seem to be nice. they have a nice topology (comp lete separable metric spaces) and are vector spaces. but what’s missing is lebesgue measure. s pecifically: theorem 1.1. “there is no infinite-dimensional lebesgue measure.” let wbe an infinitedimensional separable banach space. there does not exist a tr anslation-invariant borel measure onwwhich assigns positive finite measure to open balls. in fact, a ny translation-invariant borel measuremonwis either the zero measure or assigns infinite measure to ever y open set. proof.essentially, the problem is that inside any ball b(x,r), one can find infinitely many disjoint ballsb(xi,s) of some fixed smaller radius s. by translation invariance, all the b(xi,s) have the same measure. if that measure is positive, then m(b(x,r)) =∞. if that measure is zero, then we observe that wcan be covered by countably many balls of radius s(by separability) and so mis the zero measure. the first sentence is essentially riesz’s lemma: given any pr oper closed subspace e, one can find a point xwith||x|| ≤1 andd(x,e)>1/2. (start by picking any y /∈e, so thatd(y,e)>0; then by definition there is an z∈ewithd(y,z)<2d(y,e). now look at y−zand rescale as needed.) now let’s look at b(0,2) for concreteness. construct x1,x2,...inductively by letting en= span{x1,...,x n}(which is closed) and choosing xn+1as in riesz’s lemma with ||xn+1|| ≤1 andd(xn+1,en)>1/2. in particular, d(xn+1,xi)>1/2 fori≤n. since our space is infinite dimensional, the finite-dimensional subspaces enare always proper and the induction can continue, producing a sequence {xi}withd(xi,xj)>1/2 fori/\\e}atio\\slash=j, and thus the balls b(xi,1/4) are pairwise disjoint. 2 exercise 1.2. prove the above theorem for wan infinite-dimensional hausdorff topological vector space. (do we need separability?) a more intuitive idea why infinite-dimensional lebesgue mea sure can’t exist comes from considering the effect of scaling. in rn, the measure of b(0,2) is 2ntimes larger than b(0,1). when n=∞this suggests that one cannot get sensible numbers for the me asures of balls. there are nontrivial translation-invariant borel measure s on infinite-dimensional spaces: for instance, counting measure. but these measures are useless for analysis since they cannot say anything helpful about open sets. so we are going to have to give up on translation invariance, a t least for now. later, as it turns out, we will study some measures that recover a little bit of t his: they are quasi-invariant under sometranslations. this will be explained in due course. 1.3 probability measures in infinite dimensions if we just wanted to think about borel measures on infinite-di mensional topological vector spaces, we actually have lots of examples from probability, that we d eal with every day. example 1.3. let (ω,f,p) be a probability space and x1,x2,...a sequence of random variables. consider the infinite product space r∞, thought of as the space of all sequences {x(i)}∞ i=1of real numbers. this is a topological vector space whenequippedwi th its producttopology. we can equip r∞with its borel σ-algebra, which is the same as the product borel σ-algebra (verify). then the map from ω to r∞which sends ωto the sequence x(i) =xi(ω) is measurable. the pushforward ofpunder this map gives a borel probability measure μonr∞. the kolmogorov extension theorem guarantees lots of choice s for the joint distribution of the xi, and hence lots of probability measures μ. perhaps the simplest interesting case is when the xi are iid with distribution ν, in which case μis the infinite product measure μ=/producttext∞ i=1ν. note that in general one can only take the infinite product of probability measures (essentially because the only number awith 0</producttext∞ i=1a<∞isa= 1). example 1.4. let (ω,f,p) bea probability space, and {xt: 0≤t≤1}beany stochastic process. we could play the same game as before, getting a probability m easure on r[0,1](with its product σ-algebra). this case is not as pleasant because nothing is co untable. in particular, the borel σ-algebra generated by the product topology is not the same as the product σ-algebra (exercise: verify this, perhaps by showing that the latter does not cont ain singleton sets.) also, the product topology on r[0,1]is rather nasty; for example it is not first countable. (in con trast,r∞with its product topology is actually a polish space.) so we will avoi d examples like this one. example 1.5. as before, but now assume {xt: 0≤t≤1}is acontinuous stochastic process. we can then map ω into the banach space c([0,1]) in the natural way, by sending ωto the continuous functionx·(ω). one can check that this map is measurable when c([0,1]) is equipped with its borelσ-algebra. (hint: ||x|| ≤1 if and only if |x(t)| ≤1 for alltin a countable dense subset of [0,1].) so by pushing forward pwe get a borel probability measure on c([0,1]). for example, if xtis brownian motion, this is the classical wiener measure. so probability measures seem more promising. we are going to concentrate on gaussian probability measures. let’s start by looking at them in finite dim ensions. 3 1.4 gaussian measures in finite dimensions in one dimension everyone knows what gaussian means. we are g oing to require our measures / random variables to be centered (mean zero) to have fewer let ters floating around. however we are going to include the degenerate case of zero variance. definition 1.6. a borel probability measure μonrisgaussian with variance σ2iff μ(b) =/integraldisplay b1√ 2πσe−x2/2σ2dx for all borel sets b⊂r. we also want to allow the case σ= 0, which corresponds to μ=δ0being a dirac mass at 0. we could also specify μin terms of its fourier transform (or characteristic functi on). the above condition is equivalent to having /integraldisplay reiλxμ(dx) =e−σ2λ2/2 for allλ∈r. (noteσ= 0 is naturally included in this formulation.) a random variable xon some probability space (ω ,f,p) is gaussian with variance σ2if its distribution measure is gaussian, i.e. p(x∈b) =/integraldisplay b1√ 2πσe−x2/2σ2dx. for all borel sets b. forσ= 0 we have the constant random variable x= 0. equivalently e[eiλx] =e−σ2λ2/2 for allλ∈r. let’s make a trivial observation: μis not translation invariant. however, translation doesn’ t mess it up completely. notation 1.7. letμbeameasureon avector space w. fory∈w, wedenoteby μythetranslated measure defined by μy(a) =μ(a−y). in other words,/integraltext wf(x)μy(dx) =/integraltext wf(x+y). exercise 1.8. check that i didn’t screw up the signs in the previous paragra ph. definition 1.9. a measureμon a vector space wis said to be quasi-invariant under translation byy∈wif the measures μ,μyare mutually absolutely continuous (or equivalent ); that is, if μ(a) = 0⇔μy(a) = 0 for measurable sets a⊂w. intuitively, quasi-invariance means that translation can change the measure of a set, but it doesn’t change whether or not the measure is zero. one way i like to think about equivalent measures is with the f ollowing baby example. suppose i have two dice which look identical on the surface, but one of them is fair, and the other produces numbers according to the distribution (0 .1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.5) (i.e. it comes up 6 half the time). (note that they induceequivalent measures on {1,2,3,4,5,6}: in both cases theonly set of measure zero is the empty set.) i pick one of the dice and ask you to dete rmine which one it is. if you roll a lot of 6s, you will have a strong suspicion that it’s the unfa ir die, but you can’t absolutely rule out the possibility that it’s the fair die and you are just unl ucky. 4 on the other hand, suppose one of my dice always comes up even, and the other always comes up odd. in this case the induced measures are mutually singul ar: there is a set (namely {1,3,5}) to which one gives measure 0 and the other gives measure 1. if i give you one of these dice, then all you have to do is roll it once and see whether the number is even or odd, and you can be (almost) sure which die you have. for gaussian measures on r, note that if σ/\\e}atio\\slash= 0, thenμis quasi-invariant under translation by anyy∈r. this is a trivial fact: both μandμyhave positive densities with respect to lebesgue measurem, soμ(a) = 0 iffμy(a) = 0 iffm(a) = 0. we’ll also note that, as absolutely continuous measures, they have a radon-nikodym derivative, which we ca n compute just by dividing the densities: dμy dμ(x) =1√ 2πσe−(x−y)2/2σ 1√ 2πσe−x2/2σ2 =e−y2 2σ2+xy σ2. just pay attention to the form of this expression, as we will s ee it again later. on theother hand, in the degenerate case σ= 0, thenμ=δ0andμy=δyare mutually singular. now let’s look at the n-dimensional case. definition 1.10. ann-dimensional random vector x= (x1,...,x n) isgaussian if and only if λ·x:=/summationtextλixiis a gaussian random variable for all λ= (λ1,...,λ n)∈rn. or in terms of measures: definition 1.11. letμbe a borel probability measure on rn. for each λ∈rn, we can think of the map rn∋x/ma√sto→λ·x∈ras a random variable on the probability space ( rn,brn,μ).μis gaussian if and only if this random variable is gaussian for each λ. of course, we know that the distribution of xis uniquely determined by its n×ncovariance matrix σ, where σ ij= cov(xi,xj). note that σ is clearly symmetric and positive semidefinite . furthermore, any symmetric, positive semidefinite matrix σ can arise as a covariance matrix: let z= (z1,...,z n) whereziare iid gaussian with variance 1, and set x= σ1/2z. a consequence of this is that if ( x1,...,x n) has a joint gaussian distribution, then the xiare independent if and only if they are uncorrelated (i.e. cov( xi,xj) = 0 fori/\\e}atio\\slash=j, i.e. σ is diagonal). note that this failsif all we know is that each xihas a gaussian distribution. proposition 1.12. x is gaussian if and only if it has characteristic function e[eiλ·x] =e−1 2λ·σλ whereσis the covariance matrix of x. or, in terms of measures: proposition 1.13. a probability measure μonrnis gaussian if and only if /integraldisplay rneiλ·xμ(dx) =e−1 2λ·σλ for somen×nmatrixς, which is necessarily positive semidefinite and can be chose n symmetric. 5 we would like to work more abstractly and basis-free, in prep aration for the move to infinite dimensions. the map x/ma√sto→λ·xis really just a linear functional on rn. so let’s write: definition 1.14. letμbe a borel probability measure on a finite-dimensional topol ogical vector spacew. then each f∈w∗can be seen as a random variable on the probability space ( w,bw,μ). μisgaussian if and only if, for each f∈w∗, this random variable is gaussian. equivalently, μis gaussian iff the pushforward μ◦f−1is a gaussian measure on rfor each f∈w∗. of course we have not done anything here because a finite-dime nsional topological vector space wisjustsome rnwithitsusualtopology. everylinearfunctional f∈w∗isoftheform f(x) =λ·x, and all such linear functionals are continuous, hence measu rable. iff,g∈w∗are thought of as gaussian random variables on ( w,μ), thenq(f,g) = cov(f,g) is a symmetric, positive semidefinite, bilinear form on w∗. we’ll also write q(f) =q(f,f) = var(f). qis the basis-free analogue of the covariance matrix; we coul d call it the covariance form. as we argued above, in this finite-dimensional case, any such bili near form can arise as a covariance form. another way to think about this is that since each f∈w∗is gaussian, it is certainly squareintegrable, i.e./integraltext w|f(x)|2μ(dx) =e|f|2= var(f)<∞. sov∗can be thought of as a subspace of l2(v,μ). thenqis nothing but the restriction of the l2inner product to the subspace w∗. (technically, qmay be degenerate, in which case it is actually the quotient o fw∗by the kernel ofqthat we identify as a subspace of l2(w,μ).) exercise 1.15. the support of the measure μis given by suppμ=/intersectiondisplay q(f,f)=0kerf. one could write supp μ= (kerq)⊥. in particular, if qis positive definite, then μhas full support. (recall that the support of a measure μis defined as the smallest closed set with full measure.) exercise 1.16. the restriction of μto its support is a nondegenerate gaussian measure (i.e. the covariance form is positive definite). exercise 1.17. μis quasi-invariant under translation by yif and only if y∈suppμ. ify /∈suppμ, thenμandμyare mutually singular. (we’ll see that in infinite dimension s, the situation is more complex.) in terms of characteristic functions, then, we have proposition 1.18. a borel probability measure μon a finite-dimensional topological vector space wis gaussian if and only if, for each f∈w∗, we have /integraldisplay weif(x)μ(dx) =e−1 2q(f,f) whereqis some positive semidefinite symmetric bilinear form on w∗. 6 2 infinite-dimensional gaussian measures definition 1.14 will generalize pretty immediately to infini te-dimensional topological vector spaces. there is just one problem. an arbitrary linear functional on a topological vector space can be nasty; in particular, it need not be borel measurable, in whi ch case it doesn’t represent a random variable. but continuous linear functionals are much nicer , and are borel measurable for sure, so we’ll restrict our attention to them.2 as usual,w∗will denote the continuous dual of w. definition 2.1. letwbe a topological vector space, and μa borel probability measure on w. μisgaussian iff, for each continuous linear functional f∈w∗, the pushforward μ◦f−1is a gaussian measure on r, i.e.fis a gaussian random variable on ( w,bw,μ). as before, we get a covariance form qonw∗whereq(f,g) = cov(f,g). again,w∗can be identified as a subspace of l2(w,μ), andqis the restriction of the l2inner product. proposition 2.2. a borel probability measure μon a topological vector space wis gaussian if and only if, for each f∈w∗, we have /integraldisplay weif(x)μ(dx) =e−1 2q(f,f) whereqis some positive semidefinite symmetric bilinear form on w∗. exercise 2.3. iff1,...,fninw∗, then (f1,...,fn) has a joint gaussian distribution. exercise 2.4. anyq-orthogonal subset of w∗is an independent set of random variables on ( w,μ). for the most part, we will concentrate on the case that wis a separable banach space. but as motivation, we first want to look at a single case where it is n’t. if you want more detail on the general theory for topological vector spaces, see bogachev [2]. 3 motivating example: r∞with product gaussian measure as in example 1.3, let’s take w=r∞with its product topology. let’s record some basic facts about this topological vector space. exercise 3.1. wis a fr ́ echet space (its topology is generated by a countable family of seminorms). exercise 3.2. wis a polish space. (so we are justified in doing all our topolog ical arguments with sequences.) exercise 3.3. the topology of wdoes not come from any norm. exercise 3.4. the borelσ-algebra of wis the same as the product σ-algebra. 2in the case of separable banach spaces, or more generally pol ish topological vector spaces, this sufficient condition is also necessary: a linear functional is borel measurable i f and only if it is continuous. even the weaker assumption of so-called baire measurability is sufficient, in fact. see 9 .c of [13]. so we are not giving up anything by requiring continuity. thanks to clinton conley for explaining this to me and providing a reference. this sort of goes to show that a linear functional on a separable banach space is eithe r continuous or really really nasty. 7 exercise 3.5. every continuous linear functional f∈w∗is of the form f(x) =n/summationdisplay i=1aix(i) for somea1,...,a n∈r. thusw∗can be identified with c00, the set of all real sequences which are eventually zero. let’s write eifor the element of wwithei(j) =δij, andπifor the projection onto the i’th coordinate πi(x) =x(i). (noteπi∈w∗; indeed they form a basis.) as in example 1.3, we choose μto be an infinite product of gaussian measures with variance 1. equivalently, μis the distribution of an iid sequence of standard gaussian r andom variables. so the random variables πiare iid standard gaussian. exercise 3.6. μis a gaussian measure. the covariance form of μis given by q(f,g) =∞/summationdisplay i=1f(ei)g(ei). (note that the sum is actually finite.) exercise 3.7. μhas full support. qis actually positive definite: the only f∈w∗withq(f,f) = 0 isf= 0. sow∗is an honest subspace of l2(w,μ). it is not a closed subspace, though; that is, w∗is not complete in the q inner product. let kdenote the l2(w,μ)-closure of w∗. exercise 3.8. show thatkconsists of all functions f:w→rof the form f(x) =∞/summationdisplay i=1aix(i) (3.1) where/summationtext∞ i=1|ai|2<∞. this formula requires some explanation. for an arbitrary x∈w, the sum in (3.1) may not converge. however, show that it does converg e forμ-a.e.x∈w. (hint: sums of independent random variables converge a.s. as soon as they c onverge inl2; see theorem 2.5.3 of durrett [7].) note well that the measure-1 set on which (3.1) converges depends on f, and there will not be a single measure-1 set where convergence holds fo r everyf. moreover, show each f∈k is a gaussian random variable. (kis isomorphic to l2; this should make sense, since it is the completion of w∗=c00in theq inner product, which is really the l2inner product.) now let’s think about how μbehaves under translation. a first guess, by analogy with the case of product gaussian measure on rn, is that it is quasi-invariant under all translations. but l et’s look closer at the finite-dimensional case. if νis standard gaussian measure on rn, i.e. dν=1 (2π)n/2e−|x|2/2dx then a simple calculation shows dνy dν(x) =e−1 2|y|2+x·y. (3.2) 8 note that the euclidean norm of yappears. sending n→ ∞, the euclidean norm becomes the l2 norm. this suggests that l2should play a special role. in particular, translation by yis not going to produce a reasonable positive radon-nikodym derivative if/ba∇dbly/ba∇dbll2=∞. let’s denote l2, considered as a subset of w, byh.hhas a hilbert space structure coming from thel2norm, which we’ll denote by /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblh. we note that, as shown in exercise 3.8, that for fixedh∈h, (h,x)hmakes sense not only for x∈hbut forμ-a.e.x∈w, and (h,·)his a gaussian random variable on ( w,μ) with variance /ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2 h. theorem 3.9 (special case of the cameron-martin theorem) .ifh∈h, thenμis quasi-invariant under translation by h, and dμh dμ(x) =e−1 2/bardblh/bardbl2 h+(h,x)h. (3.3) conversely, if y /∈h, thenμ,μyare mutually singular. proof.we are trying to show that μh(b) =/integraldisplay be−1 2/bardblh/bardbl2 h+(h,x)hμ(dx) (3.4) for all borel sets b⊂w. it is sufficient to consider the case where bis a “cylinder set” of the form b=b1×···×bn×r×..., since the collection of all cylinder sets is a π-system which generates the borelσ-algebra. but this effectively takes us back to the n-dimensional setting, and unwinding notation will show that in this case (3.3) is the same as (3.2) . this is a bit messy to write out; here is an attempt. if you don’ t like it i encourage you to try to just work it out yourself. sincewis a product space, let us decompose it as w=rn×r∞, writingx∈was (xn,x∞) withxn= (x(1),...,x(n)) andx∞= (x(n+ 1),...). thenμfactors asμn×μ∞, whereμnis standard gaussian measure on rnandμ∞is again product gaussian measure on r∞.μhfactors asμn hn×μ∞ h∞. also, the integrand in (3.4) factors as e−1 2|hn|2+hn·xne−1 2||h∞||2 l∞+(h∞,x∞)l2. so by tonelli’s theorem the right side of (3.4) equals /integraldisplay b1×···×bne−1 2|hn|2+hn·xnμn(dxn)/integraldisplay r∞e−1 2||h∞||2 l∞+(h∞,x∞)l2μ∞(dx∞). the first factor is equal to μn hn(b1× ··· ×bn) as shown in (3.2). since ( h∞,·)l2is a gaussian random variable on ( r∞,μ∞) with variance ||h∞||2 l2, the second factor is of the form e[ex−σ2/2] forx∼n(0,σ2), which is easily computed to be 1. since μ∞ h∞(r∞) = 1 also (it is a probability measure), we are done with the forward direction. for the converse direction, suppose h /∈h. then, by the contrapositive of lemma a.1, there existsg∈l2such that/summationtexth(i)g(i) diverges. let a={x∈w:/summationtextx(i)g(i) converges }; this set is clearly borel, and we know μ(a) = 1 by exercise 3.8. but if/summationtextx(i)g(i) converges, then/summationtext(x−h)(i)g(i) diverges, so a−his disjoint from aandμh(a) =μ(a−h) = 0. we callhthecameron–martin space associated to ( w,μ). 9 exercise 3.10. his dense in w, and the inclusion map h ֒→wis continuous (with respect to thel2topology on hand the product topology on w). althoughhis dense, there are several senses in which it is small. proposition 3.11. μ(h) = 0. proof.forx∈w,x∈hiff/summationtext i|πi(x)|2<∞. note that the πiare iidn(0,1) random variables on (w,μ). so by the strong law of large numbers, for μ-a.e.x∈wwe have1 n/summationtextn i=1|πi(x)|2→1; in particular/summationtext i|πi(x)|2=∞. exercise 3.12. any bounded subset of his precompact and nowhere dense in w. in particular, his meager in w. soμis quasi-invariant only under translation by elements of th e small subset h. 4 abstract wiener space much of this section comes from bruce driver’s notes [5] and f rom kuo’s book [14]. definition 4.1. anabstract wiener space is a pair (w,μ) consisting of a separable banach spacewand a gaussian measure μonw. later we will write an abstract wiener space as ( w,h,μ) wherehis the cameron–martin space. technically this is redundant because hwill be completely determined by wandμ. len gross’s original development [9, 10] went the other way, sta rting withhand choosing a ( w,μ) to match it, and this choice is not unique. we’ll discuss this mo re later. definition 4.2. (w,μ) isnon-degenerate if the covariance form qonw∗is positive definite. exercise 4.3. ifμhas full support (i.e. μ(u)>0 for every nonempty open u) then (w,μ) is non-degenerate. (for the converse, see exercise 4.25 below .) from now on, we will assume( w,μ) is non-degenerate unless otherwisespecified. (this assum ption is really harmless, as will be justified in remark 4.26 be low.) sow∗is honestly (injectively) embedded into l2(μ), andqis the restriction to w∗of thel2(μ) inner product. as before, we let kdenote the closure of w∗inl2(μ). note that we now have two different topologies on w∗: the operator norm topology (under which it is complete), and the topology induced by the qorl2inner product (under which, as we shall see, it is not complete). the interplay between them wi ll be a big part of what we do here. 4.1 measure-theoretic technicalities the main point of this subsection is that the continuous line ar functionals f∈w∗, and other functions you can easily build from them, are the only functi ons onwthat you really have to care about. letbdenote the borel σ-algebra on w. lemma 4.4. letσ(w∗)be theσ-field onwgenerated by w∗, i.e. the smallest σ-field that makes everyf∈w∗measurable. then σ(w∗) =b. 10 note that the topology generated by w∗is not the same as the original topology on w; instead it’s the weak topology. proof.since eachf∈b∗is borel measurable, σ(w∗)⊂ bis automatic. letbbe the closed unit ball of w; we will show b∈σ(w∗). let{xn}be a countable dense subset ofw. by the hahn-banach theorem, for each xnthere exists fn∈w∗with||fn||w∗= 1 andfn(xn) =||xn||. i claim that b=∞/intersectiondisplay n=1{x:|fn(x)| ≤1}. (4.1) the⊂directionisclearbecausefor x∈b,|fn(x)| ≤ ||fn||·||x||=||x|| ≤1. forthereversedirection, suppose |fn(x)| ≤1 for alln. choose a sequence xnk→x; in particular fnk(xnk) =||xnk|| → ||x||. but since ||fnk||= 1, we have ||fnk(xnk)−fnk(x)|| ≤ ||xnk−x|| →0, so||x||= limfnk(xnk) = limfnk(x)≤1. we have thus shown b∈σ(w∗), since the right side of (4.1) is a countable intersection of sets from w∗. if you want to show b(y,r)∈σ(w∗), we have b(y,r) =∞/intersectiondisplay n=1{x:|fn(x)−fn(y))|<r}. now note that any open subset uofwis acountable union of closed balls (by separability) so u∈σ(w∗) also. thus b ⊂σ(w∗) and we are done. note that we used the separability of w, but we did not assume that w∗is separable. exercise 4.5. ifwis not separable, lemma 4.4 may be false. for a counterexampl e, consider w=l2(e) for some uncountable set e. one can show that σ(w∗) consists only of sets that depend on countably many coordinates. more precisely, for a⊂eletπa:l2(e)→l2(a) be the restriction map. show that σ(w∗) is exactly the set of all π−1 a(b), whereais countable and b⊂l2(a) is borel. in particular, σ(w∗) doesn’t contain any singletons (in fact, every nonempty subset ofσ(w∗) is non-separable). question 1. is lemma 4.4 alwaysfalse for non-separable w? functionals f∈w∗are good for approximation in several senses. we are just goi ng to quote the following results. the proofs can be found in [5], and are mostly along the same lines that you prove approximation theorems in basic measure theory. for t his subsection, assume μis a borel probability measure on w(not necessarily gaussian). notation 4.6. letfc∞ c(w) denote the “smooth cylinder functions” on w: those functions f:w→rof the form f(x) =φ(f1(x),...,fn(x)) for some f1,...,fn∈w∗andφ∈c∞ c(r). (note despite the notation that fis not compactly supported; in fact there are no nontrivial continuous functions on wwith compact support.) notation 4.7. lettbe the “trigonometric polynomials” on w: those functions f:w→rof the formf(x) =a1eif1(x)+···+aneifn(x)fora1,...,a n∈r,f1,...,fn∈w∗. theorem 4.8. fc∞ candtare each dense in lp(w,μ)for any1≤p<∞. 11 a nice way to prove this is via dynkin’s multiplicative syste m theorem (a functional version of theπ-λtheorem). theorem 4.9 (uniqueness of the fourier transform) .letμ,νbe two borel probability measures onw. if/integraltext eif(x)μ(dx) =/integraltext eif(x)ν(dx)for allf∈w∗, thenμ=ν. we could think of the fourier transform of μas the map ˆ μ:w∗→rdefined by ˆ μ(f) =/integraltext eif(x)μ(dx). the previous theorem says that ˆ μcompletely determines μ. 4.2 fernique’s theorem thefirstresultwe want to prove is fernique’s theorem [8], wh ich in some sensesays that a gaussian measure has gaussian tails: the probability of a randomly sa mpled point being at least a distance t from the origin decays like e−t2. in one dimension this is easy to prove: if μis a gaussian measure onrwith, say, variance 1, we have μ({x:|x|>t}) = 2/integraldisplay∞ t1√ 2πe−x2/2dx ≤2√ 2π/integraldisplay∞ tx te−x2/2dx =2 t√ 2πe−t2/2(4.2) where the second line uses the fact thatx t≥1 forx≥t, and the third line computes the integral directly. this is sort of like a heat kernel estimate. theorem 4.10 (fernique [8]) .let(w,μ)be an abstract wiener space. there exist ǫ>0,c >0 such that for all t, μ({x:||x||w≥t})≤ce−ǫt2. the proof is surprisingly elementary and quite ingenious. let’s prove fernique’s theorem. we follow driver’s proof [5 , section 43.1]. some of the details will be sketched; refer to driver to see them filled in. the key idea is that products of gaussian measures are “rotat ion-invariant.” lemma 4.11. let(w,μ)be an abstract wiener space. then the product measure μ2=μ×μis a gaussian measure on w2. if you’re worried about technicalities, you can check the fo llowing:w2is a banach space under the norm ||(x,y)||w2:=||x||w+||y||w; the norm topology is the same as the product topology; the borelσ-field onw2is the same as the product of the borel σ-fields onw. proof.letf∈(w2)∗. if we set f(x) =f(x,0),g(y) =f(0,y), we see that f,g∈w∗and f(x,y) =f(x)+g(y). now when we compute the fourier transform of f, we find /integraldisplay w2eiλf(x,y)μ2(dx,dy) =/integraldisplay weiλf(x)μ(dx)/integraldisplay weiλg(y)μ(dy) =e−1 2λ2(q(f,f)+q(g,g)). 12 proposition 4.12. forθ∈r, define the “rotation” rθonw2by rθ(x,y) = (xcosθ−ysinθ,xsinθ+ycosθ). (we are actually only going to use rπ/4(x,y) =1√ 2(x−y,x+y).) ifμis gaussian, μ2is invariant underrθ. invariance of μ2underrπ/4is the only hypothesis we need in order to prove fernique’s th eorem. you might think this is a very weak hypothesis, and hencefern ique’s theorem shouldapply to many other classes of measures. however, it can actually be shown that any measure μsatisfying this condition must in fact be gaussian, so no generality is reall y gained. proof.letν=μ2◦r−1 θ; we must show that ν=μ2. it is enough to compare their fourier transforms. let f∈(w2)∗, sow(x,y) =f(x)+g(y), and then /integraldisplay w2ei(f(x)+g(y))ν(dx,dy) =/integraldisplay w2ei(f(tx)+g(ty))μ2(dx,dy) =/integraldisplay w2ei(cosθf(x)−sinθf(y)+sinθg(x)+cosθg(y))μ2(dx,dy) =/integraldisplay wei(cosθf(x)+sinθg(x))μ(dx)/integraldisplay wei(−sinθf(y)+cosθg(y))μ(dy) =e−1 2(✭✭✭✭✭✭(sin2θ+cos2θ)q(f,f)+✭✭✭✭✭✭(sin2θ+cos2θ)q(g,g)) =/integraldisplay w2ei(f(x)+g(y))μ2(dx,dy). we can now really prove fernique’s theorem. proof.in this proof we shall write μ(/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≤t) as shorthand for μ({x:/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≤t}), etc. let 0≤s≤t, and consider μ(/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≤s)μ(/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≥t) =μ2({(x,y) :/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≤s,/ba∇dbly/ba∇dbl ≥t}) =μ2/parenleftbigg/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble1√ 2(x−y)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble≤s,/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble1√ 2(x+y)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble≥t/parenrightbigg byrπ/4invariance of μ2. now some gymnastics with the triangle inequality shows tha t if we have/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble1√ 2(x−y)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble≤sand/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble1√ 2(x+y)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble≥t, then/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl,/ba∇dbly/ba∇dbl ≥t−s√ 2. so we have μ(/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≤s)μ(/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≥t)≤μ2/parenleftbigg /ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≥t−s√ 2,/ba∇dbly/ba∇dbl ≥t−s√ 2/parenrightbigg =/parenleftbigg μ/parenleftbigg /ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≥t−s√ 2/parenrightbigg/parenrightbigg2 . if we rearrange and let a(t) =μ(/bardblx/bardbl≥t) μ(/bardblx/bardbl≤s), this gives a(t)≤a/parenleftbiggt−s√ 2/parenrightbigg2 . (4.3) 13 once and for all, fix an slarge enough that μ(/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≥s)<μ(/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≤s) (so thata(s)<1). now we’ll iterate (4.3). set t0=s,tn+1=√ 2(tn+s), so that (4.3) reads a(tn+1)≤a(tn)2, which by iteration impliesa(tn)≤a(s)2n. sincetn↑ ∞, for anyr≥swe havetn≤r≤tn+1for somen. note that tn+1=sn+1/summationdisplay k=02k/2≤c2n/2 since the largest term dominates. ais decreasing so we have a(r)≤a(tn)≤a(s)2n≤a(s)r2/c2 so thata(r)≤e−ǫr2, takingǫ=−log(a(s))/c2. sincea(r) =μ(/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≤s)μ(/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl ≥r) we are done. corollary 4.13. ifǫis as provided by fernique’s theorem, for ǫ′<ǫwe have/integraltext weǫ′||x||2μ(dx)<∞. proof.standard trick: for a nonnegative random variable x,ex=/integraltext∞ 0p(x >t)dt. so /integraldisplay weǫ′||x||2μ(dx) =/integraldisplay∞ 0μ({x:eǫ′||x||2>t})dt =/integraldisplay∞ 0μ/parenleftbigg/braceleftbigg x:||x||>/radicalbigg logt ǫ′/bracerightbigg/parenrightbigg dt ≤/integraldisplay∞ 0t−ǫ/ǫ′dt<∞. the following corollary is very convenient for dominated co nvergence arguments. corollary 4.14. for anyp>0,/integraltext w||x||p wμ(dx)<∞. proof.tpgrows more slowly than eǫt2. corollary 4.15. the inclusion w∗֒→l2(μ)is bounded. in particular, the l2norm onw∗is weaker than the operator norm. proof.forf∈w∗,||f||2 l2=/integraltext w|f(x)|2μ(dx)≤ ||f||2 w∗/integraltext w||x||2μ(dx)≤c||f||2 w∗by the previous corollary. (this would be a good time to look at exercises c.1–c.6 to get s ome practice working with different topologies on a set.) actually we can say more than the previous corollary. recall that an operator t:x→yon normed spaces is said to be compact if it maps bounded sets to precompact sets, or equivalently if for every bounded sequence {xn} ⊂x, the sequence {txn} ⊂yhas a convergent subsequence. proposition 4.16. the inclusion w∗֒→l2(μ)is compact. 14 proof.suppose {fn}is a bounded sequence in w∗; say/ba∇dblfn/ba∇dblw∗≤1 for alln. by alaoglu’s theorem there is a weak-* convergent subsequence fnk, which is to say that fnkconverges pointwise to some f∈w∗. note also that |fnk(x)| ≤ /ba∇dblx/ba∇dblwfor allk, and/integraltext w/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl2 wμ(dx)<∞as we showed. so by dominated convergence, fnk→finl2(w,μ), and we found an l2-convergent subsequence. this fact is rather significant: since compact maps on infinit e-dimensional spaces can’t have continuous inverses, this shows that the w∗andl2topologies on w∗must be quite different. in particular: corollary 4.17. w∗is not complete in the qinner product (i.e. in the l2(μ)inner product), except in the trivial case that wis finite dimensional. proof.we’ve shownthe identity map ( w∗,/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblw∗)→(w∗,q) is continuous and bijective. if ( w∗,q) is complete, then by the open mapping theorem, this identity map is a homeomorphism, i.e. the w∗andqnorms are equivalent. but the identity map is also compact, w hich means that bounded sets, such as the unit ball, are precompact (under either top ology). this means that w∗is locally compact and hence finite dimensional. so the closure kofw∗inl2(w,μ) is apropersuperset of w∗. 4.3 the cameron–martin space our goal is to find a hilbert space h⊂wwhich will play the same role that l2played for r∞. the key is that, for h∈h, the mapw∗∋f/ma√sto→f(h) should be continuous with respect to the q inner product on w∗. as before, let kbe the closure of w∗inl2(w,μ). we’ll continue to denote the covariance form onk(and onw∗) byq. we’ll also use mto denote the inclusion map m:w∗→k. recall that we previously argued that mis compact. lemma 4.18. everyk∈kis a gaussian random variable on (w,μ). proof.sincew∗is dense in k, there is a sequence fn∈w∗converging to kinl2(w,μ). in particular, they converge in distribution. by lemma a.3, kis gaussian. definition 4.19. thecameron–martin space hof (w,μ) consists of those h∈wsuch that the evaluation functional f/ma√sto→f(h) onw∗is continuous with respect to the qinner product. his obviously a vector space. forh∈h, the mapw∗∋f/ma√sto→f(h) extends by continuity to a continuous linear functional on k. sincekis a hilbert space this may be identified with an element of kitself. thus we have a mappingt:h→ksuch that for f∈w∗, q(th,f) =f(h). a natural norm on his defined by /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblh= sup/braceleftbigg |f(h)|/radicalbig q(f,f):f∈w∗,f/\\e}atio\\slash= 0/bracerightbigg . this makes tinto an isometry, so /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblhis in fact induced by an inner product /a\\}b∇acketle{t·,·/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hthonh. 15 next, we note that his continuously embedded into w. we have previously shown (using fernique) that the embedding of w∗intokis continuous, i.e. q(f,f)≤c2/ba∇dblf/ba∇dbl2 w∗. so forh∈h andf∈w∗, we have |f(h)| /ba∇dblf/ba∇dblw∗≤c|f(h)|/radicalbig q(f,f). when we take the supremum over all nonzero f∈w∗, the left side becomes /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblw(by hahn– banach) and the right side becomes c/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblh. so we have /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblw≤c/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblhand the inclusion i:h ֒→wis continuous. (redundant given the next paragraph.) next, we check that ( h,/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblh) is complete. suppose hn is cauchy in h-norm. in particular, it is bounded in hnorm, so say /ba∇dblhn/ba∇dblh≤mfor alln. since the inclusion of hintowis bounded, hnis also cauchy in w-norm, hence converges in w-norm to somex∈w. now fixǫ>0, and choose nso large that ||hn−hm||h<ǫfor allm≥n. given a nonzerof∈w∗, we can choose m≥nso large that |f(hm−x)| ≤ǫ/radicalbig q(f,f). then f(hn−x)/radicalbig q(f,f)≤|f(hn−hm)/radicalbig q(f,f)+|f(hm−x)|/radicalbig q(f,f)</ba∇dblhn−hm/ba∇dblh+ǫ<2ǫ. we can then take the supremum over fto find that /ba∇dblhn−x/ba∇dblh<2ǫ, sohn→xinh-norm. next, we claim the inverse of tis given by jk=/integraldisplay wxk(x)μ(dx) where the integral is in the sense of bochner. (to see that the integral exists, note that by fernique /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dbl ∈l2(w,μ).) forf∈w∗,k∈k, we have |f(jk)|=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplay wf(x)k(x)μ(dx)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=|q(f,k)| ≤/radicalbig q(f,f)q(k,k) whence/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/integraltext wxk(x)μ(dx)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble h≤/radicalbig q(k,k). sojis a continuous operator from ktoh. next, for f∈w∗we have q(tjk,f) =f(jk) =q(k,f) as we just argued. since w∗is dense in k, we havetjk=k. in particular, tis surjective, and hence unitary. question 2. could we have done this without the bochner integral? we previously showed that the inclusion map i:h→wis continuous, and it’s clearly 1-1. it has an adjoint operator i∗:w∗→h. we note that for f∈w∗andh∈h, we have q(f,th) =f(h) =/a\\}b∇acketle{ti∗f,h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth=q(ti∗f,th). sincetis surjective we have q(f,k) =q(ti∗f,k) for allk∈k; thusti∗is precisely the inclusion mapm:w∗→k. sincemis compact and 1-1 and tis unitary, it follows that i∗is compact and 1-1. sincei∗is 1-1, it follows that his dense in w: iff∈w∗vanishes on h, it means that for all h∈h, 0 =f(h) =/a\\}b∇acketle{ti∗f,h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth, soi∗f= 0 andf= 0. the hahn–banach theorem then implies his dense inw. moreover, schauder’s theorem from functional analysis (s ee for example [3, theorem vi.3.4]) states that an operator between banach spaces is co mpact iff its adjoint is compact, so i is compact as well. in particular, his not equal to w, and is not complete in the wnorm. we can sum up all these results with a diagram. 16 theorem 4.20. the following diagram commutes. w∗ i∗ /d126/d126m/d47/d47k j /d116/d116hi/d47/d47t/d52/d52 w(4.4) all spaces are complete in their own norms. all dotted arrows are compact, 1-1, and have dense image. all solid arrows are unitary. sometimes it’s convenient to work things out with a basis. proposition 4.21. there exists a sequence {ek}∞ k=1⊂w∗which is an orthonormal basis for k. ekare iidn(0,1)random variables under μ. forh∈h, we have /ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2 h=/summationtext∞ k=1|ek(h)|2, and the sum is infinite for h∈w\\h. proof.the existence of {ek}is proved in lemma a.2. they are jointly gaussian random vari ables since μis a gaussian measure. orthonormality means they each have v ariance 1 and are uncorrelated, so are iid. ifh∈h, then/summationtext k|ek(h)|2=/summationtext k|q(ek,th)|2=/ba∇dblth/ba∇dbl2 k=/ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2 hsincetis an isometry. conversely, suppose x∈wandm:=/summationtext k|ek(x)|2<∞. lete⊂x∗be the linear span of {ek}, i.e. the set of all f∈w∗of the form f=/summationtextn k=1akek. for suchfwe have |f(x)|2=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen/summationdisplay k=1akek(x)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2 ≤/parenleftbiggn/summationdisplay k=1|ak|2/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggn/summationdisplay k=1|ek(x)|2/parenrightbigg (cauchy–schwarz) ≤mq(f,f) thusx/ma√sto→f(x) is a bounded linear functional on ( e,q).

(question: can we prove this without needing t he cameron–martin hammer? i think yes, look for references.) remark 4.26.there really isn’t any generality lost by assuming that ( w,μ) is non-degenerate. if you want to study the degenerate case, let f={f∈w∗:q(f,f) = 0}be the kernel of q, and consider the closed subspace w0:=/intersectiondisplay f∈fkerf⊂w. we claim that μ(w0) = 1. for each f∈f, the condition q(f,f) =/integraltext f2dμ= 0 implies that f= 0μ-almost everywhere, so μ(kerf) = 1, but as written, w0is an uncountable intersection of such sets. to fix that, note that since wis separable, the unit ball b∗ofw∗is weak-* compact metrizable, hence weak-* separable metrizable, hence so is its subsetf∩b∗. so we can choose a countable weak-* sequence {fn} ⊂f∩b∗. then i claim w0=/intersectiondisplay nkerfn. the⊂inclusion is obvious. to see the other direction, suppose x∈/intersectiontext nkerfnandf∈f; we will showf(x) = 0. by rescaling, we can assume without loss of generality t hatf∈b∗. now choose a subsequence fnkconverging weak-* to f; sincefnk(x) = 0 by assumption, we have f(x) = 0 also. noww0is written as a countable intersection of measure-1 subsets, so μ(w0) = 1. 18 we can now work on the abstract wiener space ( w0,μ|w0). note that the covariance form q0 defined onw∗ 0byq0(f0,f0) =/integraltext w0f2 0dμagrees with q, since given any extension f∈w∗off0will satisfy q(f,f) =/integraldisplay wf2dμ=/integraldisplay w0f2dμ=/integraldisplay w0f2 0dμ=q0(f0,f0). this makes it easy to see that that q0is positive definite on w∗ 0. supposeq0(f0,f0) = 0 and use hahn–banach to choose an extension f∈w∗off0. thenq(f,f) = 0, so by definition of w0, we havew0⊂kerf; that is,fvanishes on w0, so the restriction f0=f|w0is the zero functional. it now follows, from the previous exercise, that the support ofμis precisely w0. so (w0,μ|w0) is a non-degenerate abstract wiener space, and we can do all o ur work on this smaller space. i’d like to thank philipp wacker for suggesting this remark a nd sorting out some of the details. 4.4 example: gaussian processes recall that a one-dimensional stochastic process xt,0≤t≤1 is said to be gaussian if, for any t1,...,tn≥0, the random vector ( xt1,...,x tn) has a joint gaussian distribution. if the process is continuous, its distribution gives a probability measur eμonw=c([0,1]). if there is any good in the world, this ought to be an example of a gaussian measure . by the riesz representation theorem, we know exactly what w∗is: it’s the set of all finite signed borel measures νon [0,1]. we don’t yet know that all of these measures represent gau ssian random variables, but we know that some of them do. let δtdenote the measure putting unit mass att, soδt(ω) =/integraltext1 0ω(t)dδt=ω(t). we know that {δt}t∈[0,1]are jointly gaussian. if we let e⊂w∗ be their linear span, i.e. the set of all finitely supported si gned measures, i.e. the set of measures ν=/summationtextn i=1aiδti, then all measures in eare gaussian random variables. lemma 4.27. eis weak-* dense in w∗, and dense in k. proof.supposeν∈w∗. given a partition p={0 =t0<···< tn= 1}of [0,1], setνp=/summationtextn j=1/integraltext 1(tj−1,tj]dνδtj. then for each ω∈c([0,1]),/integraltext ωdνp=/integraltext ωpdν, where ωp=n/summationdisplay j=1ω(tj)1(tj−1,tj]. but by uniform continuity, as the mesh size of pgoes to 0, we have ωp→ωuniformly, and so/integraltext ωpdν→/integraltext ωdν. thusνp→νweakly-*. corollary 4.28. μis a gaussian measure. proof.everyν∈w∗is a pointwise limit of a sequence of gaussian random variabl es, hence gaussian. lemma 4.29. eis dense in k. proof.{νp}is bounded in total variation (in fact /ba∇dblνp/ba∇dbl ≤ /ba∇dblν/ba∇dbl). so by fernique’s theorem and dominated convergence, νp→νinl2(x,μ). thuseisl2-dense inw∗. sincew∗isl2-dense in k,eis dense in k. 19 note that in order to get μto be non-degenerate, it may be necessary to replace wby a smaller space. for example, if xtis brownian motion started at 0, the linear functional ω/ma√sto→ω(0) is a.s. zero. so we should take w={ω∈c([0,1]) :ω(0) = 0}. one might write this as c0((0,1]). recall that a gaussian process is determined by its covarian ce function a(s,t) =e[xsxt] = q(δs,δt). some examples: 1. standard brownian motion xt=btstarted at 0: a(s,t) =sfors<t. markov, martingale, independent increments, stationary increments. 2. ornstein–uhlenbeck process defined by dxt=−xtdt+σdbt:a(s,t) =σ2 2(e−(t−s)−e−(t+s)), s<t. markov, not a martingale. 3. fractional brownian motion with hurst parameter h∈(0,1):a(s,t) =1 2(t2h+s2h−(t− s)2h),s<t. not markov. 4. brownian bridge xt=bt−tb1:a(s,t) =s(1−t),s < t. (herewshould be taken as {ω∈c([0,1]) :ω(0) =ω(1) = 0}=c0((0,1)), the so-called pinned loop space.) lemma 4.30. the covariance form qfor a gaussian process is defined by q(ν1,ν2) =/integraldisplay1 0/integraldisplay1 0a(s,t)ν1(ds)ν2(dt) forν1,ν2∈w∗. proof.fubini’s theorem, justified with the help of fernique. lemma 4.31. j:k→his defined by jk(t) =q(k,δt). fork=ν∈w∗this givesjν(t) = i∗ν(t) =/integraltext1 0a(s,t)ν(ds). in particular jδs(t) =a(s,t). proof.jk(t) =δt(jk) =q(k,δt). observe that aplays the role of a reproducing kernel in h: we have /a\\}b∇acketle{th,a(s,·)/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth=/a\\}b∇acketle{th,jδs/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht=δs(h) =h(s). this is why his sometimes called the “reproducing kernel hilbert space” or “rkhs” for w. 4.5 classical wiener space letμbe wiener measure on classical wiener space w, soa(s,t) =s∧t. theorem 4.32. the cameron–martin space h⊂wis given by the set of all h∈wwhich are absolutely continuous and have ̇h∈l2([0,1],m). the cameron-martin inner product is given by /a\\}b∇acketle{th1,h2/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth=/integraltext1 0 ̇h1(t) ̇h2(t)dt. proof.let ̃hbe the candidate space with the candidate norm /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dbl ̃h. it’s easy to see that ̃his a hilbert space. note thatjδs(t) =s∧t∈ ̃h, so by linearity jmapseinto ̃h. note ̇jδs= 1[0,s]. moreover, /a\\}b∇acketle{tjδs,jδr/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht ̃h=/integraldisplay1 01[0,s]1[0,r]dm=s∧r=q(δs,δr) sojis an isometry from ( e,q) to ̃h. hence it extends to an isometry of kto ̃h. sincejis already an isometry from ktohwe haveh= ̃hisometrically. 20 now what can we say about t? it’s a map that takes a continuous function from hand returns a random variable. working informally, we would say that th(ω) =/a\\}b∇acketle{th,ω/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth=/integraldisplay1 0 ̇h(t) ̇ω(t)dt. (4.5) this formula is absurd because ̇ ωis nonexistent for μ-a.e.ω(brownian motion sample paths are nowhere differentiable). however, it is actually the right an swer if interpreted correctly. let’s suppose that his piecewise linear: then its derivative is a step function ̇h=/summationtextn i=1bi1[ci,di]. note that the reproducing kernel a(s,·) has as its derivative the step function 1 [0,s]. so by integrating, we see that we can write h(t) =n/summationdisplay i=1bi(a(di,t)−a(ci,t)). now we know that t[a(s,·)] =δs, i.e. the random variable bs. so we have th=n/summationdisplay i=1bi(bdi−bci). we can recognize this as the stochastic integral of the step f unction ̇h=/summationtextn i=1bi1[ci,di]: th=/integraldisplay1 0 ̇h(t)dbt. (4.6) moreover, by the itˆ o isometry we know that /vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/integraldisplay1 0 ̇h(t)dbt/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble2 l2(w,μ)=/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble ̇h/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble2 l2([0,1])=/ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2 h. thus both sides of (4.6) are isometries on h, and they are equal for all piecewise linear h. since the step functions are dense in l2([0,1]), the piecewise linear functions are dense in h(take derivatives), so in fact (4.6) holds for all h∈h. we have rediscovered the stochastic integral, at least for deterministic integrands. this is sometimes call ed the wiener integral. of course, the itˆ o integral also works for stochastic integrands, as long as they are adapted to the filtration of the brownian motion. later we shall use our machinery to prod uce the skorohod integral, which will generalize the itˆ o integral to integrands which need n ot be adapted, giving us an “anticipating stochastic calculus.” exercise 4.33. for the ornstein–uhlenbeck process, show that his again the set of absolutely continuous functions hwith ̇h∈l2([0,1]), and the cameron–martin inner product is given by /a\\}b∇acketle{th1,h2/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth=1 σ2/integraldisplay1 0 ̇h1(t) ̇h2(t)+h1(t)h2(t)dt. exercise 4.34. for the brownian bridge, show that his again the set of absolutely continuous functionshwith ̇h∈l2([0,1]), and the cameron–martin inner product is given by /a\\}b∇acketle{th1,h2/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth=/integraltext1 0ˆh1(t)ˆh2(t)dt, where ˆh(t) = ̇h(t)+h(t) 1−t. 21 perhaps later when we look at some stochastic differential equ ations, we will see where these formulas come from. note that in this case the cameron–martin theorem is a specia l case of girsanov’s theorem: it says that a brownian motion with a “smooth” drift becomes a brownian motion without drift under an equivalent measure. indeed, suppose h∈h. if we write bt(ω) =ω(t), so that {bt}is a brownian motion on ( w,μ), thenbt+h(t) is certainly a brownian motion (without drift!) on (w,μh). the cameron-martin theorem says that μhis an equivalent measure to μ. anything that btcan’t do,bt+h(t) can’t do either (since the μ-null andμh-null sets are the same). this fact has many useful applications. for example, in mathematical fina nce, one might model the price of an asset by a geometric brownian motion with a drift indicating its average rate of return (as in the black–scholes model). the cameron–martin/girsanov theor em provides an equivalent measure under which this process is a martingale, which makes it poss ible to compute the arbitrage-free price for options involving the asset. the equivalence of th e measures is important because it guarantees that changing the measure didn’t allow arbitrag e opportunities to creep in. 4.6 construction of (w,μ)fromh this section originates in [10] via bruce driver’s notes [5] . whenw=rnis finite-dimensional and μis non-degenerate, the cameron–martin space his all ofw(sincehis known to be dense in w), and one can check that the cameron–martin norm is /a\\}b∇acketle{tx,y/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth=x·ς−1y (4.7) where σ is the covariance matrix. we also know that μhas a density with respect to lebesgue measuredx, which we can write as μ(dx) =1 ze−1 2/bardblx/bardbl2 hdx (4.8) wherez=/integraltext rne−1 2/bardblx/bardbl2 hdxis a normalizing constant chosen to make μa probability measure. informally, we can think of μas being given by a similar formula in infinite dimensions: μ(dx)“ = ”1 ze−1 2/bardblx/bardbl2 hdx (4.9) wherezis an appropriate normalizing constant, and dxis infinite-dimensional lebesgue measure. of course this is nonsense in at least three different ways, but that doesn’t stop physicists, for instance. for classical wiener measure this reads μ(dx)“ = ”1 ze−1 2/integraltext1 0| ̇ω(t)|2dtdω. (4.10) since the only meaningful object appearing on the right side of (4.9) is /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblh, it is reasonable to ask if we can start with a hilbert space hand produce an abstract wiener space ( w,μ) for which his the cameron–martin space. 22 4.6.1 cylinder sets let (h,/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblh) be a separable hilbert space. definition 4.35. acylinder set is a subset c⊂hof the form c={h∈h: (/a\\}b∇acketle{th,k1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth,...,/a\\}b∇acketle{th,kn/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth)∈a} (4.11) for somen≥1, orthonormal k1,...,kn, anda⊂rnborel. exercise 4.36. letrdenote the collection of all cylinder sets in h.ris an algebra: we have ∅ ∈ randris closed under complements and finiteunions (and intersections). however, if his infinite dimensional then ris not aσ-algebra. note by lemma 4.4 that σ(r) =bh, the borel σ-algebra. we are going to try to construct a gaussian measure ̃ μonhwith covariance form given by /a\\}b∇acketle{t·,·/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth. obviously we can only get so far, since we know of several obs tructions to completing the task. at some point we will have to do something different. b ut by analogy with finite dimensions, we know what value ̃ μshould give to a cylinder set of the form (4.11): since k1,...,kn are orthonormal, they should be iid standard normal with res pect to ̃μ, so we should have ̃μ(c) =μn(a) (4.12) wheredμn=1 (2π)n/2e−|x|2/2dxis standard gaussian measure on rn. proposition 4.37. the expression for ̃μ(c)in (4.12) is well-defined, and ̃μis a finitely additive probability measure on r. proof.to check that ̃ μ(c) is well-defined, suppose that c={h∈h: (/a\\}b∇acketle{th,k1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth,...,/a\\}b∇acketle{th,kn/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth)∈a⊂rn}={h∈h: (/a\\}b∇acketle{th,k′ 1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth,...,/a\\}b∇acketle{th,k′ n′/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth)∈a′⊂rn′}. (4.13) letebe the span in hof{k1,...,kn,k′ 1,...,k′ n′}, and letm= dime. since {k1,...,kn}is orthonormal in e, we can extend it to an orthonormal basis {k1,...,km}fore, and then we have c={h∈h: (/a\\}b∇acketle{th,k1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth,...,/a\\}b∇acketle{th,km/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth)∈a×rm−n}. sinceμmis a product measure, we have μm(a×rm−n) =μn(a). so by playing the same game for{k′ 1,...,k′ n′}, there is no loss of generality in assuming that in (4.13) we h aven=n′=m, and that{k1,...,km}and{k′ 1,...,k′ m}are two orthonormal bases for the same e⊂h. we then have to show that μm(a) =μm(a′). we have two orthonormal bases for e, so there is a unitary t:e→esuch thattki=k′ i. let p:h→ebe orthogonal projection, and define s:e→rmbysx= ((x,k1),...,(x,km)). then sis unitary. if we define s′analogously, then s′=st∗=st, and we have c=p−1s−1a=p−1s′−1a′=p−1t−1s−1a′. sincep:h→eis surjective, we must have s−1a=t−1s−1a′; sinces,tare bijective this says a′=sts−1a, soa′is the image of aunder a unitary map. but standard gaussian measure 23 onrmis invariant under unitary transformations, so indeed μm(a) =μm(a′), and the expression (4.12) is well defined. it is obvious that ̃ μ(∅) = 0 and ̃ μ(h) = 1. for finite additivity, suppose c1,...,c n∈ r are disjoint. by playing the same game as above, we can write ci=p−1(ai) for some common p:h→rm, where the ai⊂rmare necessarily disjoint, and then ̃ μ(ci) =μm(ai). since/uniontext ici=p−1(/uniontext iai), the additivity of μmgives us that ̃ μ(/uniontext ici) =/summationtext i ̃μ(ci). we will call ̃ μthe canonical gaussian measure on h. as we see in the next proposition, we’re using the term “measure” loosely. proposition 4.38. ifhis infinite dimensional, ̃μis not countably additive on r. in particular, it does not extend to a countably additive measure on σ(r) =bh. proof.fix an orthonormal sequence {ei}inh. let an,k={x∈h:|/a\\}b∇acketle{tx,ei/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht| ≤k,i= 1,...,n}. an,kisacylinderset, andwehave b(0,k)⊂an,kforanyn. also, wehave ̃ μ(an,k) =μn([−k,k]n) = μ1([−k,k])nsinceμnis a product measure. since μ1([−k,k])<1, for each kwe can choose an nk so large that ̃ μ(ank,k) =μ1([−k,k])nk<2−k. thus/summationtext∞ k=1 ̃μ(ank,k)<1, but since b(0,k)⊂ank,k we have/uniontext∞ k=1ank,k=hand ̃μ(h) = 1. so countable additivity does not hold. of course we already knew that this construction cannot prod uce a genuine gaussian measure onh, since any gaussian measure has to assign measure 0 to its cam eron–martin space. the genuine measure has to live on some larger space w, so we have to find a way to produce w. we’ll produce it by producing a new norm /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblwonhwhich is not complete, and set wto be the completion of hunder/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblw. then we will be able to extend ̃ μ, in a certain sense, to an honest borel measure μonw. it’s common to make an analogy here with lebesgue measure. su ppose we were trying to construct lebesgue measure monq. we could define the measure of an interval ( a,b)⊂qto beb−a, and this would give a finitely additive measure on the algebr a of sets generated by such intervals. but it could not be countably additive. if we want a countably additive measure, it has to live on r, which we can obtain as the completion of qunder the euclidean metric. 4.6.2 measurable norms definition 4.39. by afinite rank projection we mean a map p:h→hwhich is orthogonal projection onto its image phwithphfinite dimensional. we will sometimes abuse notation and identifypwith the finite-dimensional subspace ph, since they are in 1-1 correspondence. we will write things like p1⊥p2,p1⊂p2, etc. we are going to obtain was the completion of hunder some norm /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblw. here is the condition that this norm has to satisfy. definition 4.40. a norm /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblwonhis said to be measurable if for every ǫ >0 there exists a finite rank projection p0such that ̃μ({h:/ba∇dblph/ba∇dblw>ǫ})<ǫfor allp⊥p0of finite rank (4.14) where ̃μis the canonical gaussian “measure” on h. (note that {x:/ba∇dblph/ba∇dblw>ǫ}is a cylinder set.) 24 a quick remark: if p0satisfies (4.14) for some ǫ, andp0⊂p′ 0, thenp′ 0also satisfies (4.14) for the sameǫ. this is because any p⊥p′ 0also hasp⊥p0. in words, this definition requires that ̃ μputs most of its mass in “tubular neighborhoods” of p0h. saying /ba∇dblph/ba∇dblw>ǫmeans that xis more than distance ǫ(inw-norm) from p0halong one of the directions from ph. as usual, doing the simplest possible thing doesn’t work. lemma 4.41. /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblhis not a measurable norm on h. proof.foranyfinite-rankprojection pofsomerank n,wecanfindanorthonormalbasis {h1,...,h n} forph. then it’s clear that ph=/summationtextn i=1/a\\}b∇acketle{th,hi/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hthhi, so{h:/ba∇dblph/ba∇dblh>ǫ}=p−1(bph(0,ǫ)c), where bph(0,ǫ) is a ball in ph. by definition of ̃ μwe can see that ̃μ({h:/ba∇dblph/ba∇dblh>ǫ}) =μn(brn(0,ǫ)c) ≥μn(([−ǫ,ǫ]n)c) (since the ball is contained in the cube) = 1−μ1([−ǫ,ǫ])n. thusforany ǫ>0andany finite-rankprojection p0, ifwechoose nsolargethat 1 −μ1([−ǫ,ǫ])n>ǫ, then for any projection pof ranknwhich is orthogonal to p0(of which there are lots), we have ̃μ({h:/ba∇dblph/ba∇dblh>ǫ})>ǫ. so/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblhis not measurable. as a diversion, let’s explicitly verify this for the classic al example. proposition 4.42. lethbe the classical cameron–martin space of theorem 4.32. the supr emum norm/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblw= supt∈[0,1]h(t)is a measurable norm on h. together with gross’s theorem (theorem 4.44 below), this pr oposition constitutes a construction of brownian motion: the completion wofhunder/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblwis precisely c([0,1]) (sincehis dense inc([0,1])), and the measure μonwis wiener measure (having has its cameron–martin space, we can check that its covariance function is a(s,t) =s∧tas it ought to be). with the proof we will give, however, it will not be an essenti ally new construction. indeed, we are going to steal the key ideas from a construction which is a pparently due to l ́ evy and can be found in [12, section 2.3], which one might benefit from readi ng in conjunction with this proof. in some sense, gross’s theorem is simply an abstract version of an essential step of that construction. proof.observe up front that by cauchy–schwarz |h(t)|=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplayt 0 ̇h(t)dt/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤t/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblh so taking the supremum over t∈[0,1], we have /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblw≤ /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblh. we want to choose a good orthonormal basis for h. we use the so-called “schauder functions” which correspond to the “haar functions” in l2([0,1]). the haar functions are given by fn k(t) :=  2(n−1)/2,k−1 2n≤t<k 2n −2(n−1)/2,k 2n≤t≤k+1 2n 0, else 25 wheref1 0= 1. here kshould be taken to range over the set i(n) consisting of all odd integers between 0 and 2n. (this somewhat peculiar indexing is from karatzas and shre ve’s proof. it may or may not be optimal.) we note that for n≥1, we have/integraltext1 0fn k(t)dt= 0; that for n > m,fm jis constant on the support of fn k; and that for fixed n,{fn k:k∈i(n)}have disjoint supports. from this it is not hard to check that {fn k:k∈i(n),n≥0}are an orthonormal set in l2(0,1). indeed, the set forms an orthonormal basis. the schauder functions are defined by hn k(t) :=/integraltextt 0fn k(s)ds; sincef/ma√sto→/integraltext· 0fdtis an isometric isomorphism from l2([0,1]) toh, we have that {hn k:k∈i(n),n≥0}is an orthonormal basis for h. (we can check easily that it is a basis: if /a\\}b∇acketle{th,hn k/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth= 0 thenh(k−1 2n) =h(k+1 2n). if this holds for alln,k, thenh(t) = 0 for all dyadic rationals t, whence by continuity h= 0.) stealing karatzas and shreve’s phrase, hn kis a “little tent” of height 2−(n+1)/2supported in [k−1 2n,k+1 2n]; in particular, for eachn,{hn k:k∈i(n)}have disjoint supports. letpmbe orthogonal projection onto the span of {hn k:k∈i(n),n<m}, and suppose pis a projection of finite rank which is orthogonal to pm. then for any h∈h, we can write phin terms of the schauder functions ph=∞/summationdisplay n=m/summationdisplay k∈i(n)hn k/a\\}b∇acketle{tph,hn k/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth. where the sum converges in hand hence also in w-norm, i.e. uniformly. since for fixed nthehn k have disjoint supports, we can say /ba∇dblph/ba∇dblw≤∞/summationdisplay n=m/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/summationdisplay k∈i(n)hn k/a\\}b∇acketle{tph,hn k/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble w(triangle inequality) =∞/summationdisplay n=mmax k∈i(n)/ba∇dblhn k/ba∇dblw|/a\\}b∇acketle{tph,hn k/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth|(sincehn khave disjoint support) =∞/summationdisplay n=m2−(n+1)/2max k∈i(n)|/a\\}b∇acketle{tph,hn k/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth|.(4.15) to forestall any nervousness, let us point out that all the fo llowing appearances of ̃ μwill be to measure sets of the form p−1bfor our single, fixed p, and on such sets ̃ μis an honest, countably additive measure(since it is just standard gaussian measur e on the finite-dimensional hilbert space ph). under ̃μ, each/a\\}b∇acketle{tph,hn k/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hthis a centered gaussian random variable of variance /ba∇dblphn k/ba∇dbl2 h≤1 (note that /a\\}b∇acketle{tph,hn k/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth=/a\\}b∇acketle{tph,phn k/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth, and thatpis a contraction). these random variables will be correlated in some way, but that will not bother us since we ar e not going to use anything fancier than union bounds. we recall the standard gaussian tail estimate: if nis a gaussian random variable with variance σ2≤1, thenp(|n| ≥t)≤ce−t2/2for some universal constant c. (see (4.2, or for overkill, fernique’s theorem.) thus we have for each n,k ̃μ({h:|/a\\}b∇acketle{tph,hn k/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth| ≥n})≤ce−n2/2 and so by union bound ̃μ/parenleftbigg/braceleftbigg h: max k∈i(n)|/a\\}b∇acketle{tph,hn k/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth| ≥n/bracerightbigg/parenrightbigg = ̃μ /uniondisplay k∈i(n){h:|/a\\}b∇acketle{tph,hn k/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth| ≥n} ≤c2ne−n2/2 26 since, being crude, |i(n)| ≤2n. by another union bound, ̃μ/parenleftbigg∞/uniondisplay n=m/braceleftbigg h: max k∈i(n)|/a\\}b∇acketle{tph,hn k/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth| ≥n/bracerightbigg/parenrightbigg ≤c∞/summationdisplay n=m2ne−n2/2. on the complement of this event, we have max k∈i(n)|/a\\}b∇acketle{tph,hn k/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth|< nfor everyn, and so using (4.15) we have /ba∇dblph/ba∇dblw</summationtext∞ n=mn2−(n+1)/2. thus we have shown ̃μ/parenleftbigg/braceleftbigg h:/ba∇dblph/ba∇dblw≥∞/summationdisplay n=mn2−(n+1)/2/bracerightbigg/parenrightbigg ≤c∞/summationdisplay n=m2ne−n2/2.

any finite-rank projection p orthogonal to pm, we have ̃μ({h:/ba∇dblph/ba∇dblw>ǫ})≤ǫ (4.17) which is to say that /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblwis a measurable norm. the name “measurable” is perhaps a bit misleading on its face : we are not talking about whetherh/ma√sto→ /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblwis a measurable function on h. it just means that /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblwinteracts nicely with the “measure” ̃ μ. however, /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblwis in fact a measurable function on h, in fact a continuous function, so that it is a weaker norm than /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblh. lemma 4.43. if/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblwis a measurable norm on h,

increasing function in/ba∇dblk/ba∇dblw, so it follows that /ba∇dblk/ba∇dblw≤mfor somem.k∈(p0h)⊥was arbitrary, and so by scaling we have that /ba∇dblk/ba∇dblw≤m/ba∇dblk/ba∇dblhfor allk∈(p0h)⊥. on the other hand, p0his finite-dimensional, so by equivalence of norms we also have /ba∇dblk/ba∇dblw≤m/ba∇dblk/ba∇dblhfor allk∈p0h, takingmlarger if needed. then for any k∈h, we can decompose korthogonally

[10]) .supposehis a separable hilbert space and /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblwis a measurable norm onh. letwbe the completion of hunder/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblw. there exists a gaussian measure μon (w,/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblw)whose cameron-martin space is (h,/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblh). proof.we start by constructing a sequence of finite-rank projectio nspninductively. first, pick a countable dense sequence {vn}ofh. letp0= 0. then suppose that pn−1has been given. by the measurability of /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblw, for eachnwe can find a finite-rank projection pnsuch that for all finite-rank projections p⊥pn, we have ̃μ({h∈h:/ba∇dblph/ba∇dblw>2−n})<2−n. as weremarked earlier, wecan always choose pnto belarger, sowecan also assumethat pn−1⊂pn and alsovn∈pnh. the latter condition ensures that/uniontext npnhis dense inh, from which it follows thatpnh→hinh-norm for all h∈h, i.e.pn↑istrongly. let us also note that rn:=pn−pn−1 is a finite-rank projection which is orthogonal to pn−1(in fact, it is projection onto the orthogonal complement of pn−1inpn), and in fact we have the orthogonal decomposition h=/circleplustext∞ n=1rnh. given an orthonormal basis for pnh, we can extend it to an orthonormal basis for pn+1h. repeating this process, we can find a sequence {hj}∞ j=1such that {h1,...,h kn}is an orthonormal basisforpnh. since/uniontextpnhisdenseinh, itfollows thattheentiresequence {hj}is anorthonormal basis forh. let{xn}be a sequence of iid standard normal random variables defined on some unrelated probability space (ω ,f,p). consider the w-valued random variable sn=kn/summationdisplay j=1xjhj. note thatsn−sn−1has a standard normal distribution on the finite-dimensiona l hilbert space rnh, so by definition of ̃ μwe have p(/ba∇dblsn−sn−1/ba∇dblw>2−n) = ̃μ({h∈h:/ba∇dblrnh/ba∇dblw>2−n})<2−n. thus/summationtext np(/ba∇dblsn−sn−1/ba∇dblw>2−n)<∞, and by borel–cantelli, we have that, p-almost surely, /ba∇dblsn−sn−1/ba∇dblw≤2−nfor all but finitely many n. in particular, p-a.s.,snis cauchy in w-norm, and hence convergent to some w-valued random variable s. letμ=p◦s−1be the law of s;μis a borel measure on w. iff∈w∗, thenf(s) = limn→∞f(sn) = lim n→∞/summationtextkn j=1f(hj)xjis a limit of gaussian random variables. hence by lemma a.3f(s) is gaussian, and moreover we have ∞>var(f(s)) = lim n→∞var(f(sn)) = lim n→∞kn/summationdisplay j=1|f(hj)|2=∞/summationdisplay j=1|f(hj)|2. pushing forward, we have that fis a gaussian random variable on ( w,μ) with variance q(f,f) =/summationtext∞ j=1|f(hj)|2<∞. soμis a gaussian measure and qis its covariance form. let hμbe the cameron–martin space associated to ( w,μ). we want to show that h=hμisometrically. this is basically just another diagram chase. 28 letidenote the inclusion map i:h ֒→w. we know by lemma 4.43 that iis 1-1, continuous and has dense range, so its adjoint i∗:w∗→his also 1-1 and continuous with dense range (exercise c.7). also, we have /ba∇dbli∗f/ba∇dbl2 h=∞/summationdisplay j=1|/a\\}b∇acketle{ti∗f,hj/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth|2=∞/summationdisplay j=1|f(hj)|2=q(f,f) so thati∗: (w∗,q)→his an isometry. next, for any h∈hand anyf∈w∗, cauchy–schwarz gives |f(h)|2=|/a\\}b∇acketle{ti∗f,h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth|2≤ /ba∇dbli∗f/ba∇dbl2 h/ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2 h=q(f,f)/ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2 h so thatf/ma√sto→f(h) is a continuous linear functional on ( w∗,q). that is,h∈hμ, and rearranging and taking the supremum over fshows/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblhμ≤ /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblh. on the other hand, if fn∈w∗withi∗fn→h inh, we have by definition |fn(h)|/radicalbig q(fn,fn)≤ /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblhμ. asn→ ∞,fn(h) =/a\\}b∇acketle{ti∗fn,h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth→ /ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2 h, and since i∗is an isometry, q(fn,fn) =/ba∇dbli∗fn/ba∇dbl2 h→ /ba∇dblh/ba∇dbl2 h, so the left side tends to /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblh. thus/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblh=/ba∇dblh/ba∇dblhμ. we have shown h⊂hμisometrically; we want equality. note that his closed in hμ, since his complete in h-norm and hence also in hμ-norm. so it suffices to show his dense in hμ. suppose there exists g∈hμwith/a\\}b∇acketle{tg,h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hthμ= 0 for allh∈h. ifiμ:hμ֒→wis the inclusion map, we know that i∗ μ: (w∗,q)→hμhas dense image and is an isometry. so choose fn∈w∗with i∗ μfn→ginhμ. thenfnisq-cauchy, and so i∗fnconverges in h-norm to some k∈h. but for h∈h, /a\\}b∇acketle{tk,h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth= lim/a\\}b∇acketle{ti∗fn,h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth= limfn(h) = lim/a\\}b∇acketle{ti∗ μfn,h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hthμ=/a\\}b∇acketle{tg,h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hthμ= 0 so thatk= 0. then /ba∇dblg/ba∇dbl2 hμ= lim/vextenddouble/vextenddoublei∗ μfn/vextenddouble/vextenddouble2 hμ= limq(fn,fn) = lim/ba∇dbli∗fn/ba∇dbl2 h= 0 sog= 0 and we are done. here is one way to describe what is going on here. if hjis an orthonormal basis for h, then s=/summationtextxjhjshould be a random variable with law μ. however, this sum diverges in halmost surely (since/summationtext|xj|2=∞a.s.). so if we want it to converge, we have to choose a weaker n orm. the condition of measurability is not only sufficient but also necessary. theorem 4.45. let(w,μ)be an abstract wiener space with cameron–martin space h. then /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblwis a measurable norm on h. the first proof of this statement, in this generality, seems t o have appeared in [6]. for a nice proof due to daniel stroock, see bruce driver’s notes [5]. remark 4.46.the mere existence of a measurable norm on a given hilbert spa cehis trivial. indeed, since all infinite-dimensional separable hilbert s paces are isomorphic, as soon as we have found a measurable norm for one hilbert space, we have found o ne for any hilbert space. 29 one might wonder if the completion whas any restrictions on its structure. equivalently, which separable banach spaces wadmit gaussian measures? this is a reasonable question, sin ce banach spaces can have strange “geometry.”3however, the answer is that there are no restrictions. theorem 4.47 (gross[10, remark2]) .ifwis any separable banach space, there exists a separable hilbert space densely embedded in w, on which the w-norm is measurable. equivalently, there exists a non-degenerate gaussian measure on w. proof.the finite-dimensional case is trivial, so we suppose wis infinite dimensional. we start with the case of hilbert spaces. first, there exists a separable (infinite-dimensional) hil bert spacewwith a densely embedded separable hilbert space hon which the w-norm is measurable. proposition 4.59 tells us that, given any separable hilbert space h, we can construct a measurable norm /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblwonhby letting /ba∇dblh/ba∇dblw=/ba∇dblah/ba∇dblh, whereais a hilbert–schmidt operator on h. note that /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblwis induced by the inner product /a\\}b∇acketle{th,k/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htw=/a\\}b∇acketle{tah,ak/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth, so if we let wbe the completion of hunder/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblw, thenw is a separable hilbert space with hdensely embedded. (we should take ato be injective. an example of such an operator is given by taking an orthonormal basis{en}and letting aen=1 nen.) now, since all infinite-dimensional separable hilbert spac es are isomorphic, this shows that the theorem holds for any separable hilbert space w. suppose now that wis a separable banach space. by the following lemma, there ex ists a separable hilbert space h1densely embedded in w. in turn, there is a separable hilbert space h densely embedded in h1, on which the h1-norm is measurable. the w-norm onhis weaker than theh1-norm, so it is measurable as well. (exercise: check the deta ils.) alternatively, there exists a non-degenerate gaussian mea sureμ1onh1. push it forward under the inclusion map. as an exercise, verify that this gives a no n-degenerate gaussian measure on w. lemma 4.48 (gross).ifwis a separable banach space, there exists a separable hilber t spaceh densely embedded in w. proof.we repeat a construction of gross [10]. since wis separable, we may find a countable set{zi} ⊂wwhose linear span is dense in w; without loss of generality, we can take {zn}to be linearly independent. we will construct an inner product /a\\}b∇acketle{t·,·/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htkonk= span{zi}such that /ba∇dblx/ba∇dblw≤ /ba∇dblx/ba∇dblkfor allx∈k; thuskwill be an inner product space densely embedded in w. we inductively construct a sequence {ai}such thatai/\\e}atio\\slash= 0 for any real numbers b1,...,bnwith/summationtextn i=1b2 i≤1, we have /ba∇dbl/summationtextn i=1aibizi/ba∇dblw<1. to begin, choose a1with 0<|a1|</ba∇dblz1/ba∇dbl−1 w. suppose now thata1,...,a n−1have been appropriately chosen. let dn={(b1,...,bn) :/summationtextn i=1b2 n≤1 be the closed euclidean unit disk of rnand consider the map f:dn×r→wdefined by f(b1,...,bn,a) =n−1/summationdisplay i=1aibizi+abnzn. nowfis obviously continuous, and by the induction hypothesis we havef(dn×{0})⊂s, where sis the open unit ball of w. so by continuity, f−1(s) is an open set containing dn×{0}; hence 3a particularly bizarre example was given recently in [1]: a s eparable banach space xsuch that every bounded operator tonxis of the form t=λi+k, where kis a compact operator. in some sense, xhas almost the minimum possible number of bounded operators. 30 f−1(s) contains some set of the form dn×(−ǫ,ǫ). thus if we choose any anwith 0≤ |an|<ǫ, we have the desired property for a1,...,a n. setyi=aizi; since theaiare nonzero, the yispankand are linearly independent. let /a\\}b∇acketle{t·,·/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htkbe theinnerproducton kwhichmakes the yiorthonormal; then wehave /ba∇dbl/summationtextn i=1biyi/ba∇dbl2 k=/summationtextn i=1b2 i. by ourconstruction, wehave thatany x∈kwith/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl2 k≤1has/ba∇dblx/ba∇dblw<1aswell, so kiscontinuously and densely embedded in w. that is to say, the inclusion map i: (k,/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblk)→(w,/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblw) is continuous. let ̄kbe the abstract completion of k, so ̄kis a hilbert space. since wis banach, the continuous map i:k→wextends to a continuous map ̄i: ̄k→wwhose image is dense (as it containsk). it is possible that ̄iis not injective, so let h= (ker ̄i)⊥be the orthogonal complement in ̄kof its kernel. his a closed subspace of ̄k, hence a hilbert space in its own right, and the restriction ̄i|h:h→wis continuous and injective, and its range is the same as that of ̄i, hence still dense in w. remark 4.49.the final step of the previous proof (passing to (ker ̄i)⊥) is missing from gross’s original proof, as was noticed by ambar sengupta, who asked i f it is actually necessary. here is an example to show that it is. letwbe a separable hilbert space with orthonormal basis {en}∞ n=1, and letsbe the left shift operatordefinedby se1= 0,sen=en−1forn≥2. notethatthekernel of sisone-dimensional and spanned by e1. letebe the subspace of wspanned by the vectors hn=en−en+1,n= 1,2,.... it is easy to check that e1/∈e, so the restriction of stoeis injective. on the other hand, eis dense inw: for suppose x∈e⊥. since/a\\}b∇acketle{tx,hn/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htw= 0, we have /a\\}b∇acketle{tx,en/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htw=/a\\}b∇acketle{tx,en+1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htw, so in fact there is a constantcwith/a\\}b∇acketle{tx,en/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htw=cfor alln. but parseval’s identity says/summationtext∞ n=1|/a\\}b∇acketle{tx,en/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htw|2=/ba∇dblx/ba∇dbl2 w<∞ so we must have c= 0 and thus x= 0. we also remark that seis also dense in w: sinceshn=hn−1, we actually have e⊂se. so we have a separable inner product space e, a separable hilbert space w, and a continuous injective map s|e:e→wwith dense image, such that the continuous extension of s|eto the completion of e(namelyw) is not injective (since the extension is just sagain). tomakethislookmorelikegross’sconstruction, wejustren amethings. set k=seanddefine an inner product on kby/a\\}b∇acketle{tsx,sy/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htk=/a\\}b∇acketle{tx,y/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htw(this is well defined because sis injective on e). nowkis an inner product space, continuously and densely embedde d inw, but the completion ofkdoes not embed in w(the continuous extension of the inclusion map is not inject ive, since it is reallysin disguise). the inner product space ( k,/a\\}b∇acketle{t·,·/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htk) could actually be produced by gross’s construction. by applying the gram–schmidt algorithm to {hn}, we get an orthonormal set {gn}(with respect to /a\\}b∇acketle{t·,·/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htw) which still spans e. (in fact, {gn}is also an orthonormal basis for w.) takezn=sgn; the zns arelinearly independentandspan k, whichisdensein w. if/summationtextn i=1b2 i≤1, then/ba∇dbl/summationtextn i=1bizi/ba∇dblw= /ba∇dbls/summationtextn i=1bigi/ba∇dblw≤1 becausesis a contraction and the giare orthonormal. so we can take ai= 1 in the induction.4then of course the inner product which makes the znorthonormal is just /a\\}b∇acketle{t·,·/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htk. we can make the issue even more explicit: consider the series/summationtext∞ n=1/a\\}b∇acketle{tgn,e1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htwzn. under /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblk, this series is cauchy, since znis orthonormal and/summationtext n|/a\\}b∇acketle{tgn,e1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htw|2=/ba∇dble1/ba∇dbl2 w= 1; and its limit is not zero, since there must be some

standard brownian motion on (w,μ). proof.your favorite proof of the existence of one-dimensional bro wnian motion should work. for instance, one can use the kolmogorov extension theorem to co nstruct a countable set of w-valued random variables {bt:t∈e}, indexed by the dyadic rationals e, with independent increments andbt−bs∼μt−s. (the consistency of the relevant family of measures comes f rom the property μt∗μs=μt+s, just as in the one-dimensional case.) if you are worried tha t you only know the kolmogorov extension theorem for r-valued random variables, you can use the fact that any polis h space can be measurably embedded into [0 ,1]. then the kolmogorov continuity theorem (replacing absolute values with /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblw) can be used to show that, almost surely, btis h ̈ older continuous as a function between the metric spaces eandw. use the fact that e/ba∇dblbt−bs/ba∇dblβ w=/integraldisplay w/ba∇dblx/ba∇dblβ wμt−s(dx) = (t−s)β/2/integraldisplay w/ba∇dblx/ba∇dblβ wμ(dx)≤c(t−s)β/2 by fernique. in particular btis, almost surely, uniformly continuous and so extends to a c ontinuous function on [0 ,∞). exercise 5.5. for anyf∈w∗,f(bt) is a one-dimensional brownian motion with variance q(f,f). iff1,f2,...areq-orthogonal, then the brownian motions f1(bt),f2(bt),...are independent. question 3. ifhjis an orthonormal basis for h, andbj tis an iid sequence of one-dimensional standard brownian motions, does/summationtext∞ j=1bj thjconverge uniformly in w, almost surely, to a brownian motion on w? that would be an even easier construction. exercise 5.6. letw′=c([0,1],w) (which is aseparable banach space) and consider themeasur e μ′onw′induced by {bt,0≤t≤1}. show that μ′is a gaussian measure. for extra credit, find a nice way to write its covariance form. exercise 5.7. supposew=c([0,1]) andμis the law of a one-dimensional continuous gaussian processxswith covariance function a(s1,s2). letys,t=bt(s) be the corresponding two-parameter process (note btis a random element of c([0,1]) sobt(s) is a random variable). show ys,tis a continuous gaussian process whose covariance function is e[ys1,t1ys2,t2] = (t1∧t2)a(s1,s2). ifxsis one-dimensional brownian motion, then ys,tis called the brownian sheet . bthas essentially all the properties you would expect a browni an motion to have. you can open your favorite textbook on brownian motion and pick most any theorem that applies to ddimensional brownian motion, and the proof should go throug h with minimal changes. we note a few important properties here. proposition 5.8. btis a markov process, with transition probabilities px(bt∈a) =μx t(a) := μ(t−1/2(a−x)). proof.the markov property is immediate, because bthas independent increments. computing the transition probabilities is also very simple. 35 proposition 5.9. btis a martingale. proof.obvious, because it has independent mean-zero increments. proposition 5.10. btobeys the blumenthal 0-1law: letft=σ(bs: 0≤s≤t)andf+ t=/intersectiontext s>tfs. thenf+ 0ispx-almost trivial, i.e. for any a∈ f+ 0and anyx∈w,px(a) = 0or1. proof.this holds for any continuous markov process. the transition semigroup of btis ptf(x) =exf(bt) =/integraldisplay fμx t=/integraldisplay f(x+t1/2y)μ(dy) which makes sense for any bounded measurable function. clea rlyptis markovian (positivitypreserving and a contraction with respect to the uniform nor m). notation 5.11. letcb(w) denote the space of bounded continuous functions f:w→r. let cu(w) denote the subspace of bounded uniformly continuous functions. exercise 5.12. cb(w) andcu(w) are banach spaces. proposition 5.13. ptis a feller semigroup: if fis continuous, so is ptf. proof.fixx∈w, andǫ >0. sinceμtis radon (see section b), there exists a compact kwith μt(kc)<ǫ. for anyz∈k, the function f(·+z) is continuous at x, so there exists δzsuch that for any uwith/ba∇dblu/ba∇dblw< δz, we have |f(x+z)−f(x+u+z)|< ǫ. the balls b(z,δz/2) coverkso we can take a finite subcover b(zi,δi/2). now suppose /ba∇dblx−y/ba∇dblw<minδi/2. for any z∈k, we may chooseziwithz∈b(zi,δi/2). we then have |f(x+z)−f(y+z)| ≤ |f(x+z)−f(x+zi)|+|f(x+zi)−f(y+z)| =|f((x+(z−zi))+zi)−f(x+zi)| +|f(x+zi)−f((x+(y−x)+(z−zi))+zi)| each term is of the form |f(x+zi)−f(x+u+zi)|for someuwith/ba∇dblu/ba∇dblw< δi, and hence is bounded by ǫ. now we have |ptf(x)−ptf(y)| ≤/integraldisplay w|f(x+z)−f(y+z)|μt(dz) =/integraldisplay k|f(x+z)−f(y+z)|μt(dz)+/integraldisplay kc|f(x+z)−f(y+z)|μt(dz) ≤ǫ+2ǫ/ba∇dblf/ba∇dbl∞. 36 remark 5.14.this shows that ptis a contraction semigroup on cb(w). we would really like to haveastrongly continuouscontraction semigroup. however ,ptisnot ingeneral stronglycontinuous oncb(w). indeed, take the one-dimensional case w=r, and letf(x) = cos(x2), so thatfis continuous and bounded but not uniformly continuous. one ca n check that ptfvanishes at infinity, for anyt. (for instance, take fourier transforms, so the convolutio n inptfbecomes multiplication. the fourier transform ˆfis just a scaled and shifted version of f; in particular it is bounded, so /hatwidestptfis integrable. then the riemann–lebesgue lemma implies tha tptf∈c0(r). one can also compute directly, perhaps by writing fas the real part of eix2.) thus if ptfwere to converge uniformly as t→0, the limit would also vanish at infinity, and so could not be f. (in fact,ptf→f pointwise as t→0, soptfdoes not converge uniformly.) remark 5.15.one should note that the term “feller semigroup” has several different and incompatible definitions in the literature, so caution is require d when invoking results from other sources. one other common definition assumes the state space xis locally compact, and requires that pt be a strongly continuous contraction semigroup on c0(x), the space of continuous functions “vanishing at infinity”, i.e. the uniform closure of the continuo us functions with compact support. in our non-locally-compact setting this condition is meaning less, sincec0(w) = 0. proposition 5.16. bthas the strong markov property. proof.this should hold for any feller process. the proof in durrett looks like it would work. theorem 5.17. ptis a strongly continuous contraction semigroup on cu(w). proof.letf∈cu(w). we first check that ptf∈cu(w). it is clear that ptfis bounded; indeed,/ba∇dblptf/ba∇dbl∞≤ /ba∇dblf/ba∇dbl∞. fixǫ >0. there exists δ >0 such that |f(x)−f(y)|< ǫwhenever /ba∇dblx−y/ba∇dblw<δ. for suchx,ywe have |ptf(x)−ptf(y)| ≤/integraldisplay |f(x+z)−f(y+z)|μt(dz)≤ǫ. thusptfis uniformly continuous. next, we have |ptf(x)−f(x)| ≤/integraldisplay |f(x+t1/2y)−f(x)|μ(dy) =/integraldisplay /ba∇dblt1/2y/ba∇dblw<δ|f(x+t1/2y)−f(x)|μ(dy)+/integraldisplay /ba∇dblt1/2y/ba∇dblw≥δ|f(x+t1/2y)−f(x)|μ(dy) ≤ǫ+2/ba∇dblf/ba∇dbl∞μ({y:/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddoublet1/2y/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble w≥δ}). butμ({y:/vextenddouble/vextenddoublet1/2y/vextenddouble/vextenddouble w≥δ}) =μ(b(0,t−1/2)c)→0 ast→0. so for small enough twe have |ptf(x)−f(x)| ≤2ǫindependent of x. remark 5.18.cu(x) is not the nicest banach space to work with here; in particul ar it is not separable, and its dual space is hard to describe. however, t he usual nice choices that work in finite dimensions don’t help us here. in rn,ptis a strongly continuous semigroup on c0(rn); but in infinite dimensions c0(w) = 0. inrn,ptis also a strongly continuous symmetric semigroup on l2(rn,m), wheremis lebesgue measure. in infinite dimensions we don’t have lebesgue measu re, but we might wonder whether μ 37 could stand in: is pta reasonable semigroup on l2(w,μ)? the answer is emphatically no; it is not even a well-defined operator. first note that pt1 = 1 for all t. letei∈w∗beq-orthonormal, so that under

l2(w,μ), butpt1 andpt1aare not. we knew that hwas “thin” in win the sense that μ(h) = 0. in particular, this means that for anyt,p(bt∈h) = 0. actually more is true. proposition 5.19. letσh= inf{t>0 :bt∈h}. then for any x∈w,px(σh=∞) = 1. that is, from any starting point, with probability one, btneverhitsh. in other words, his polar for bt. proof.fix 0< t1< t2<∞. ifbtis a standard one-dimensional brownian motion started at 0, letc=p(inf{bt:t1≤t≤t2} ≥1), i.e. the probability that btis above 1 for all times betweent1andt2. clearlyc >0. by the strong markov property it is clear that for x0>0, p(inf{bt+x0:t1≤t≤t2} ≥1)> c, and by symmetry p(sup{bt−x0:t1≤t≤t2} ≤ −1)> c also. so for any x0∈r, we have p(inf{|bt+x0|2:t1≤t≤t2} ≥1)>c. fix aq-orthonormal basis {ek} ⊂w∗as in lemma 4.21, so that bt∈hiff/ba∇dblbt/ba∇dbl2 h=/summationtext k|ek(bt)|2<∞. under px,ek(bt) are independent one-dimensional brownian motions with variance 1 and starting points ek(x). so if we let akbe the event ak={inf{|ek(bt)|2:t1≤t≤ t2} ≥1}, by the above computation we have px(ak)> c. since the akare independent we have px(aki.o.) = 1. but on the event {aki.o}we have/ba∇dblbt/ba∇dbl2 h=/summationtext∞ k=1|ek(bt)|2=∞for allt∈[t1,t2]. thuspx-a.s.btdoes not hit hbetween times t1andt2. now lett1↓0 andt2↑ ∞along sequences to get the conclusion. remark 5.20.a priori it is not obvious that σh: ω→[0,∞] is even measurable (its measurability it is defined by an uncountable infimum, and there is no apparen t way to reduce it to a countable infimum), or that {σh=∞}is a measurable subset of ω. what we really showed is that ther e is a (measurable) event a={aki.o.}withpx(a) = 1 and σh=∞ona. if we complete the measurable space (ω ,f) by throwing in all the sets which are px-null for every x, then{σh=∞} will be measurable and so will σh. in the general theory of markov processes one shows that unde r some mild assumptions, including the above completion technique, σbis indeed measurable for any borel (or even analytic) setb. 6 calculus on abstract wiener space the strongly continuous semigroup ptoncu(w) has a generator l, defined by lf= lim t↓01 t(ptf−f). 38 this is an unbounded operator on cu(w) whose domain d(l) is the set of all ffor which the limit converges in cu(w). it is a general fact that lis densely defined and closed. in the classical setting where w=rnandμis standard gaussian measure (i.e. q=/a\\}b∇acketle{t·,·/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htrn), so thatbtis standard brownian motion, we know that l=−1 2∆ is the laplace operator, which sums the second partial derivatives in all orthogonal direction s. note that “orthogonal” is with respect to the euclidean inner product, which is also the cameron–ma rtin inner product in this case. we should expect that in the setting of abstract wiener space ,lshould again bea second-order differential operator that should play the same role as the lap lacian. so we need to investigate differentiation on w. definition 6.1. letwbe a banach space, and f:w→ra function. we say fisfr ́ echet differentiable atx∈wif there exists gx∈w∗such that, for any sequence w∋yn→0 in w-norm, f(x+yn)−f(x)−gx(yn) /ba∇dblyn/ba∇dblw→0. gxis the fr ́

cylinder function. then f′(x) =n/summationdisplay i=1∂iφ(f1(x),...,fn(x))fi. as it turns out, we will be most interested in differentiating i n directions h∈h, since in some sense that is really what the usual laplacian does. also, fr ́ echet differentiability seems to be too much to ask for; according to references in kuo [14], the set o f continuously fr ́ echet differentiable functions is not dense in cu(w). definition 6.3. f:w→rish-differentiable atx∈wif there exists gx∈hsuch that for any sequence h∋hn→0 inh-norm, f(x+hn)−f(x)−/a\\}b∇acketle{tgx,hn,/an}bracketri}hth /ba∇dblhn/ba∇dblh→0.

(note that /ba∇dbldf(x)/ba∇dblhis bounded as a function of x, so there is no question that df∈lp(w;h).) lemma 6.10 (integration by parts) .letf∈ fc∞ c(w)be a cylinder function, and h∈h. then /integraldisplay w/a\\}b∇acketle{tdf(x),h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hthμ(dx) =/integraldisplay wf(x)/a\\}b∇acketle{th,x/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hthμ(dx). (6.3) proof.it is easy to see that both sides of (6.3) are bounded linear fu nctionals with respect to h, so it suffices to show that (6.3) holds for all hin a dense subset: hence suppose h=i∗ffor some f∈w∗. now basically the proof is to reduce to the finite dimensional case. by adjusting φas needed, there is no loss of generality in writing f(x) =φ(f1(x),...,fn(x)) wheref1=f. we can also apply gram–schmidt and assume that all the fiareq-orthonormal. then /a\\}b∇acketle{tdf(x),h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth= 43 ∂1φ(f1(x),...,fn(x)). thefiare iidn(0,1) random variables under μ, so we have /integraldisplay w/a\\}b∇acketle{tdf(x),h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hthμ(dx) =/integraldisplay rn∂1φ(x1,...,x n)1 (2π)n/2e−|x|2/2dx =/integraldisplay rnφ(x1,...,x n)x11 (2π)n/2e−|x|2/2dx =/integraldisplay wφ(f1(x),...,fn(x))f1(x)μ(dx) =/integraldisplay wf(x)/a\\}b∇acketle{th,x/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hthμ(dx) so we are done. we also observe that dobeys the product rule: d(f·g) =f·dg+df·g. (this is easy to check by assuming, without loss of generality, that we hav e writtenf,gin terms of the same functionals f1,...,fn∈w∗.) applying the previous lemma to this identity gives: /integraldisplay wg(x)/a\\}b∇acketle{tdf(x),h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hthμ(dx) =/integraldisplay w(−f(x)/a\\}b∇acketle{tdg(x),h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth+f(x)g(x)/a\\}b∇acketle{th,x/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth)μ(dx).(6.4) we can use this to prove: proposition 6.11. the operator d:lp(w,μ)→lp(w,μ;h)is closable. proof.suppose that fn∈ fc∞ c(w) are converging to 0 in lp(w,μ), and that dfn→ηin lp(w;h). we have to show η= 0. it is sufficient to show that/integraltext w/a\\}b∇acketle{tη(x),h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htg(x)mu(dx) = 0 for allh∈handg∈ fc∞ c(w).

(recallbt(ω) =ω(t) is just the evaluation map, a continuous linear functional of ω.) we have f∈ frsoais adapted. then u(t,ω) =h(t)f(ω) whereh(t) =/integraltextt 01(r,s)(τ)dτ. in particular h(t) = 0 fort≤r, so /a\\}b∇acketle{tdf(ω),h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth=/summationdisplay i∂iφ(bt1(ω),...,b tn(ω))h(ti) = 0. thus δu(ω) =f(ω)/a\\}b∇acketle{th,ω/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth−✭✭✭✭✭✭✭/a\\}b∇acketle{tdf(ω),h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth =f(ω)(br(ω)−bs(ω)) =/integraldisplay1 0aτdbτ(ω). 48 now we just need to do some approximation. if f∈l2(w,fr), we can approximate finl2 by cylinder functions fnof the above form. then defining un,uaccordingly we have un→u inl2(w;h) andδun→f·(br−bs) =/integraltext1 0aτdbτinl2(w), so the conclusion holds for a= f(ω)1(r,s](t). by linearity it also holds for any linear combination of su ch processes. the set of such linear combinations is dense in the adapted processe s inl2([0,1]×w), so choose such a(n)→a. note that a(t,ω)/ma√sto→/integraltextt 0a(τ,ω)dτis an isometry of l2([0,1]×w) intol2(w;h) so the corresponding unconverge to uinl2(w;h), and by the itˆ o isometry, δun=/integraltext1 0a(n) τdbτ→/integraltext1 0aτdbτ. sinceδis closed we are done. this is neat because defining an integral in terms of δlets us integrate a lot more processes. example 6.28. let’s compute/integraltext1 0b1dbs(skorohod). we have u(t,ω) =tb1=h(t)g(ω) where h(t) =t, andg(ω) =φ(f(ω)) whereφ(x) =x, andf(ω) =ω(1). soδu(ω) =g(ω)/a\\}b∇acketle{th,ω/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth− /a\\}b∇acketle{tdg(ω),h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth. but/a\\}b∇acketle{th,ω/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht=/integraltext1 0 ̇h(t)dbt=b1. anddg(ω) =jfso/a\\}b∇acketle{tdg(ω),h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth=f(h) =h(1) = 1. so/integraltext1 0b1dbs=b2 1−1. note thatb1, although it doesn’t depend on t, is not adapted. indeed, a random variable is an adapted process iff it is in f0, which means it has to be constant. all the time derivatives and integrals here are sort of a red h erring; they just come from the fact that the cameron–martin inner product has a time deriva tive in it. another cool fact is that we can use this machinery to constru ct integration with respect to other continuous gaussian processes. again let w=c([0,1]) (or an appropriate subspace), μthe law of a continuous centered gaussian process xtwith covariance function a(s,t) =e[xsxt]. since δapplies to elements of l2(w;h), and we want to integrate honest processes (such as element s ofl2([0,1]×w)), we need some way to map processes to elements of l2(w;h). for brownian motion it was at/ma√sto→/integraltextt 0asds, an isometry of l2([0,1]×w) =l2(w;l2([0,1])) =l2(w)⊗l2([0,1]) intol2(w;h). to construct such an map φ in this case, we start with the ide a that we want/integraltextt 0dxs=xt, so we should have φ1 [0,t]=jδs∈h. we can extend this map linearly to e, the set of all step functions on [0 ,1]. to make it an isometry, equip ewith the inner product defined by /a\\}b∇acketle{t1[0,s],1[0,t]/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hte=/a\\}b∇acketle{tjδs,jδt/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth=a(s,t) again extended by bilinearity. it extends isometrically to the completion of eunder this inner product, whatever that may be. so the processes we can integr ate are we can integrate processes froml2(w; ̄e) =l2(w)⊗ ̄ejust by taking/integraltext1 0adx=δuwhereu(ω) = φ(a(ω)). exactly what are the elements of l2(w; ̄e) is a little hard to say. the elements of ̄ecan’t necessarily be identified as functions on [0 ,1]; they might be distributions, for instance. but we for sure know it contains step functions, so l2(w; ̄e) at least contains “simple processes” of the form/summationtextyi1[ai,bi](t). in the case of fractional brownian motion, one can show tha t ̄econtainsl2([0,1]), so in particular φ makes sense for any process in l2(w×[0,1]). of course, there is still the question of whether φ( a)∈domδ. there’s a chapter in nualart which works out a lot of this in th e context of fractional brownian motion. being able to integrate with respect to fbm is a b ig deal, because fbm is not a semimartingale and so it is not covered by any version of itˆ o integration. a couple of properties of δin terms of the wiener chaos: 1.hn(h)⊂domδfor eachn. (follows from lemma 6.26.) 49 2. foru∈domδ,jnδu=δjn−1u. using lemma 6.17 and the fact that the jn, being orthogonal projections, are self-adjoint, we have for any f∈d1,2, /a\\}b∇acketle{tjnδu,f/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w)=/a\\}b∇acketle{tδu,jnf/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w) =/a\\}b∇acketle{tu,djnf/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w;h) =/a\\}b∇acketle{tu,jn−1df/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w;h) =/a\\}b∇acketle{tδjn−1u,f/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w). d1,2is dense in l2(w) so we are done. 3.j0δu= 0. for if f∈l2(w), then/a\\}b∇acketle{tj0δu,f/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht=/a\\}b∇acketle{tδu,j0f/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht=/a\\}b∇acketle{tu,dj0f/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht. butj0fis a constant sodj0f= 0. 6.2 the clark–ocone formula until further notice, we are working on classical wiener spa ce,w=c0([0,1]), withμbeing wiener measure. a standard result in stochastic calculus is the itˆ o representation theorem , which in its classical form says: theorem 6.29. let{bt}be a brownian motion on rd, let{ft}be the filtration it generates, and let zbe anl2random variable which is f1-measurable (sometimes called a brownian functional ). then there exists an adapted l2processytsuch that z=e[z]+/integraldisplay1 0ytdbt,a.s. sketch.this is claiming that the range of the itˆ o integral contains all thel2random variables with mean zero (which we’ll denote h⊥ 0). since the itˆ o integral is an isometry, its range is automa tically closed, so it suffices to show it is dense in h⊥ 0. one can explicitly produce a dense set. exercise 6.30. look up a proof. an important application of this theorem is in finance. suppo se we have a stochastic process {xt}which gives the price of a stock (call it acme) at time t. (temporarily you can think xt=bt is brownian motion, though this is not a good model and we migh t improve it later.) we may want to study an optionorcontingent claim , some contract whose ultimate value zis determined by the behavior of the stock. for example: •aeuropean call option is a contract which gives you the right, but not the obligatio n, to buy one share of acme at time 1 for a pre-agreed strike price k. so if the price x1at time 1 is greater than k, you will exercise your option, buy a share for kdollars, and then you can immediately sell it for x1dollars, turning a quick profit of z=x1−kdollars. if x1< k, then you should not exercise the option; it is worthless, an dz= 0. thus we can writez= (x1−k)+. 50 •aeuropean put option gives the right to sell one share of acme at a price k. similarly we havez= (k−x1)+. •afloating lookback put option gives one the right, at time 1, to sell one share of acme at the highest price it ever attained between times 0 and 1. so z= supt∈[0,1]xt−x1. •there are many more. you can’t lose money with these contracts, because you can al ways just not exercise it, and you could gain a profit. conversely, your counterparty can only l ose money. so you are going to have to pay your counterparty some money up front to get them to ent er into such a contract. how much should you pay? a “fair” price would be e[z]. but it may be that the contract would be worth more or less to you than that, depending on your appetit e for risk. (say more about this.) here the itˆ o representation theorem comes to the rescue. if xt=btis a brownian motion, it says thatz=e[z]+/integraltext1 0ytdbt. this represents a hedging strategy . consider a trading strategy where at time twe want to own ytshares of acme (where we can hold or borrow cash as needed to achieve this; negative shares are also okay because we can sell short). ytis adapted, meaning the number of shares to own can be determined by what the stock has already done. a moment’s thought shows that the net value of your portfolio at time 1 is/integraltext1 0ytdbt. thus, if we start with e[z] dollars in the bank and then follow the strategy yt, at the end we will have exactly zdollars, almost surely. we can replicate the option zfore[z] dollars (not counting transaction costs, which we assume to be negligible). so anybody that wants more thane[z] dollars is ripping us off, and we shouldn’t pay it even if we would be willing to. so a key question is whether we can explicitly find yt. in wiener space notation, zis an element of l2(w,μ), which we had usually called f. also, nowftis theσ-algebra generated by the linear functionals {δs:s≤t}; since these span a weak-* dense subset of w∗we have f1=σ(w∗) =bw, the borel σ-algebra of w. letl2 a([0,1]×w) be the space of adapted processes. exercise 6.31. l2 a([0,1]×w) is a closed subspace of l2([0,1]×w). exercise 6.32. yt/ma√sto→e[yt|ft] is orthogonal projection from l2([0,1]×w) ontol2 a([0,1]×w). this section is tangled up a bit by some derivatives coming an d going. remember that h is naturally isomorphic to l2([0,1]) via the map φ : l2([0,1])→hgiven by φf(t) =/integraltextt 0f(s)ds (its inverse is simplyd dt). thusl2(w;h) is naturally isomorphic to l2([0,1]×w). under this identification, we can identify d:d1,2→l2(w;h) with a map that takes an element f∈d1,2to a processdtf∈l2([0,1]×w); namely,dtf(ω) =d dtdf(ω)(t) =d dt/a\\}b∇acketle{tdf(ω),jδt/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth=d dt/a\\}b∇acketle{tdf(ω),·∧ t/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth. sodtf= φ−1df. the clark–ocone theorem states: theorem 6.33. forf∈d1,2, f=/integraldisplay fdμ+/integraldisplay1 0e[dtf|ft]dbt. (6.5) to prove this, we want to reduce everything to skorohod integ rals. lete⊂l2(w;h) be the image ofl2 a([0,1]×w) under the isomorphism φ. then, since the skorohod integral extends the 51 itˆ o integral, we know that e⊂domδ, andδ:e→l2(w) is an isometry. moreover, by the itˆ o representation theorem, the image δ(e) is exactly h⊥ 0, i.e. the orthogonal complement of the constants, i.e. functions with zero mean. letpdenote orthogonal projection onto e, so that e[·|ft] = φ−1pφ. we summarize this discussion by saying that the following di agram commutes. l2([0,1]×w)e[·|ft]/d47/d47 /d75/d83 φ /d11/d19l2 a([0,1]×w)/d75/d83 φ /d11/d19/integraltext1 0·dbt /d39/d39◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆ d1,2dt/d56/d56qqqqqqqqqqq d/d38/d38▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼ l2(w) l2(w;h)p/d47/d47eδ/d55/d55♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣♣(6.6) from this diagram, we see that the clark–ocone theorem reads : f=/integraldisplay fdμ+δpdf.

(note by itˆ o’s formula that dxt= xtdbt.) 52 7 ornstein–uhlenbeck process we’ve constructed one canonical process on w, namely brownian motion bt, defined by having independent increments distributed according to μ(appropriately scaled). in finite dimensions, another canonical process related to gaussian measure is th eornstein–uhlenbeck process . this is a gaussian process xtwhich can be defined by the sde dxt=√ 2dbt−xtdt. intuitively, xttries to move like a brownian motion, but it experiences a “re storing force” that always pulls it back toward the origin. imagine a brownian particle on a sp ring. a key relationship between xtand standard gaussian measure μis thatxthasμas its stationary distribution: if we start xt in a random position chosen according to μ, thenxtitself is also distributed according to μat all later times. this also means that, from any starting distrib ution, the distribution of xtconverges toμast→ ∞. one way to get a handle on the ornstein–uhlenbeck process, in finite or infinite dimensions, is via itsdirichlet form . here are some basics on the subject. 7.1 crash course on dirichlet forms supposextis a symmetric markov process on some topological space xequipped with a borel measurem. this means that its transition semigroup ttf(x) =ex[f(xt)] is a hermitian operator onl2(x,m). if we add a few extra mild conditions (e.g. c ́ adl ́ ag, stron g markov) and make xt ahunt process , the semigroup ttwill be strongly continuous. it is also markovian , i.e. if 0≤f≤1, then 0 ≤ttf≤1. for example, if x=rn,mis lebesgue measure, and xtis brownian motion, then ttf(x) =1 (2πt)n/2/integraltext rnf(y)e−|x−y|2/2tm(dy) is the usual heat semigroup. a strongly continuous contraction semigroup has an associa tedgenerator , a nonnegativedefinite self-adjoint operator ( l,d(l)) which in general is unbounded, such that tt=e−tl. for brownian motion it is l=−∆/2 withd(l) =h2(rn). associated to a nonnegative self-adjoint operator is an unb ounded bilinear symmetric form e with domain d, such that e(f,g) = (f,lg) for every f∈dandg∈d(l). we can take ( e,d) to be a closed form, which essentially says that e1(f,g) =e(f,g)+(f,g) is a hilbert inner product on d. note that dis generally larger than d(l). for brownian motion, e(f,g) =/integraltext rn∇f·∇gdmand d=h1(rn). notee1is the usual sobolev inner product on h1(rn).e(f,f) can be interpreted as the amount of “energy” contained in the distribution fdm. letting this distribution evolve under the process will tend to reduce the amount of energy as quickl y as possible. whenttis markovian, ( e,d) has a corresponding property, also called markovian. name ly, iff∈d, let ̄f=f∧1∨0 be a “truncated” version of f. the markovian property asserts that ̄f∈dande( ̄f, ̄f)≤ e(f,f). a bilinear, symmetric, closed, markovian form on l2(x,m) is called adirichlet form . so far this is nice but not terribly interesting. what’s neat is that this game can be played backwards. under certain conditions, one can start with a di richlet form and recover a hunt process with which it is associated. this is great, because c onstructing a process is usually a lot of work, but one can often just write down a dirichlet form. more over, one finds that properties of the process often have corresponding properties for the dir ichlet form. for example, if the process xthas continuous sample paths, the form ( e,d) will be local: namely, iff= 0 on the support of g, thene(f,g) = 0. conversely, if the form is local, then the associated process will have continuous sample paths. if ad ditionally the process is not killed inside 53 x, the form is strongly local : iffis constant on the support of g, thene(f,g) = 0; and the converse is also true. so you might ask: under what conditions must a dirichlet form be associated with a process? one sufficient condition is that ( e,d) beregular: thatd∩cc(x) ise1-dense in dand uniformly dense incc(x). we also have to assume that x, as a topological space, is locally compact. the main purposeof this condition is to exclude the possibility thatxcontains “holes” that the process would have to pass through. unfortunately, this condition i s useless in infinite dimensions, since if x=wis, say, an infinite-dimensional banach space, then cc(w) = 0. there is a more general condition called quasi-regular , which is actually necessary and sufficient for the existence of a process. it is sufficiently compli cated that i won’t describe it here; see ma and r ̈ ockner’s book for the complete treatment. 7.2 the ornstein–uhlenbeck dirichlet form we are going to define the ornstein–uhlenbeck process via its dirichlet form. for f,g∈d1,2, let e(f,g) =/a\\}b∇acketle{tdf,dg/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w;h). this form is obviously bilinear, symmetric, and positive s emidefinite. with the domain d1,2,eis also a closed form (in fact, e1is exactly the sobolev inner product on d1,2, which we know is complete). proposition 7.1. (e,d1,2)is markovian. proof.fixǫ>0. letφn∈c∞(r) bea sequence of smooth functions with 0 ≤φn≤1,|φ′ n| ≤1+ǫ, andφn(x)→x∧1∨0 pointwise. (draw a picture to convince yourself this is pos sible.) then φn(f)→f∧1∨0 inl2(w) by dominated convergence. then, by the chain rule, for f∈d1,2, we have/ba∇dbldφn(f)/ba∇dbll2(w;h)=/ba∇dblφ′ n(f)df/ba∇dbll2(w;h)≤(1 +ǫ)/ba∇dbldf/ba∇dbll2(w;h). it follows from alaoglu’s theorem that f∧1∨0∈d1,2, and moreover, /ba∇dbld[f∧1∨0]/ba∇dbll2(w;h)≤(1+ǫ)/ba∇dbldf/ba∇dbll2(w;h). letting ǫ→0 we are done. exercise 7.2. fill in the details in the preceding proof. theorem 7.3. (e,d1,2)is quasi-regular. therefore, there exists a hunt process xtwhose transition semigroup is tt, the semigroup corresponding to (e,d1,2). proof.see [15, iv.4.b]. lemma 7.4. the operator dislocalin the sense that for any f∈d1,2,df= 0μ-a.e. on {f= 0}. proof.letφn∈c∞ c(r) haveφn(0) = 1, 0 ≤φn≤1, andφnsupported inside/bracketleftbig −1 n,1 n/bracketrightbig ; note thatφn→1{0}pointwise and boundedly. then as n→ ∞,φn(f)df→1{f=0}dfinl2(w;h). letψn(t) =/integraltextt −∞φn(s)ds, so thatφn=ψ′ n; thenψn→0 uniformly. by the chain rule we have d(ψn(f)) =φn(f)df. now if we fix u∈domδ, we have /a\\}b∇acketle{t1{f=0}df,u/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w;h)= lim n→∞/a\\}b∇acketle{tφn(f)df,u/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w;h) = lim n→∞/a\\}b∇acketle{td(ψn(f)),u/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w;h) = lim n→∞/a\\}b∇acketle{tψn(f),δu/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w)= 0 sinceψn(f)→0 uniformly and hence in l2(w). since dom δis dense in l2(w;h), we have 1{f=0}df= 0μ-a.e., which is the desired statement. 54 corollary 7.5. the ornstein–uhlenbeck dirichlet form (e,d1,2)is strongly local. proof.letf,g∈d1,2. suppose first that f= 0 on the support of g. by the previous lemma we have (up to μ-null sets) {df= 0} ⊃ {f= 0} ⊃ {g/\\e}atio\\slash= 0} ⊃ {dg/\\e}atio\\slash= 0}. thus, for a.e. xeither df(x) = 0 ordg(x) = 0. so e(f,g) =/integraltext x/a\\}b∇acketle{tdf(x),dg(x)/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hthμ(dx) = 0. iff= 1 on the support of g, writee(f,g) =e(f−1,g) +e(1,g). the first term vanishes by the previous step, while the second term vanishes since d1 = 0. we now want to investigate the generator nassociated to ( e,d). lemma 7.6. forf∈l2(w),j0f=/integraltext fdμ, wherej0is the orthogonal projection onto h0, the constant functions in l2(w). proof.this holds over any probability space. write ef=/integraltext fdμ. clearlyeis continuous, eis the identity on the constants h0, and iff⊥ h0, then we have ef=/a\\}b∇acketle{tf,1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w)= 0 since 1 ∈ h0. soemust be orthogonal projection onto h0. lemma 7.7.

(7.3) proof.since this is mostly computation, i’ll just sketch it. letrtdenote the right side. we’ll show that rtis another semigroup with the same generator. showing that rtis a semigroup is easy once you remember that μtis a convolution semigroup, or in other words /integraldisplay w/integraldisplay wg(ax+by)μ(dy)μ(dx) =/integraldisplay wg/parenleftbig/radicalbig a2+b2z/parenrightbig μ(dz). to check the generator is right, start with the finite dimensi onal case. if φis a nice smooth function on rn, andp(y)dyis standard gaussian measure, then show that d dt|t=0/integraldisplay rnφ/parenleftbig e−tx+/radicalbig 1−e−2ty/parenrightbig p(y)dy= ̃nφ(x). (first differentiate under the integral sign. for the term wit h thex, evaluate at t= 0. for the term withy, integrate by parts, remembering that yp(y) =−∇p(y). if in doubt, assign it as homework to a math 2220 class.) now iffis a smooth cylinder function on w, do the same and use the previous lemma, noting that (e1,...,en) have a standard normal distribution under μ. there is probably some annoying density argument as the last step. the interested reader can work it out and let me know how it went. this shows that at time t,xtstarted atxhas a gaussian distribution (derived from μ) with meane−txand variance 1 −e−2t. here is a general property of markovian semigroups that we wi ll use later: lemma 7.15. for bounded nonnegative functions f,g, we have |tt(fg)(x)|2≤tt(f2)(x)tt(g2)(x). (7.4) proof.note the following identity: for a,b≥0, ab=1 2inf r>0/parenleftbigg ra2+1 rb2/parenrightbigg . 57 (one direction is the am-gm inequality, and the other comes f rom taking r=b/a.) so tt(fg) =1 2tt/parenleftbigg inf r>0/parenleftbigg rf2+1 rg2/parenrightbigg/parenrightbigg ≤1 2inf r>0/parenleftbigg rtt(f2)+1 rtt(g2)/parenrightbigg =/radicalbig tt(f2)tt(g2) where in the second line we used the fact that ttis linear and markovian (i.e. if f≤gthen ttf≤ttg). as a special case, taking g= 1, we have |ttf(x)|2≤tt(f2)(x). alternative proof: use (7.3), or the fact that ttf(x) =ex[f(xt)], and cauchy–schwarz. 7.3 log sobolev inequality recall that in finite dimensions, the classical sobolev embe ddingtheorem says that for φ∈c∞ c(rn) (or more generally φ∈w1,p(rn)), /ba∇dblφ/ba∇dbllp∗(rn,m)≤cn,p(/ba∇dblφ/ba∇dbllp(rn,m)+/ba∇dbl∇φ/ba∇dbllp(rn,m)) (7.5) where1 p∗=1 p−1 n. note everything is with respect to lebesgue measure. in par ticular, this says that ifφand∇φare both in lp, then the integrability of φis actually better: we have φ∈lp∗. so w1,p⊂lp∗ and the inclusion is continuous (actually, if the inclusion holds at all it has to be continuous, by the closed graph theorem). this theorem is useless in infinite dimensions in two different ways. first, it involves lebesgue measure, which doesn’t exist. second, when n=∞we getp∗=pso the conclusion is a triviality anyway. in 1975, len gross discovered the logarithmic sobolev inequ ality [11] which fixes both of these defects by using gaussian measure and being dimension-inde pendent. thus it has a chance of holding in infinite dimensions. in fact, it does. the log-sobolev inequality says that in an abstract wiener s pace, forf∈d1,2with /integraldisplay |f|2ln|f|dμ≤ /ba∇dblf/ba∇dbl2 l2(w,μ)ln/ba∇dblf/ba∇dbll2(w,μ)+/ba∇dbldf/ba∇dbl2 l2(w;h). (7.6) if you are worried what happens for fnear 0: exercise 7.16. g(x) =x2lnxis bounded below on (0 ,∞), andg(x)→0 asx↓0. so if we define “02ln0 = 0”, there is no concern about the existence of the integr al on the left side (however, what is not obvious is that it is finite). what’ s really of interest are the places where |f|is large, since then |f|2ln|f|is bigger than |f|2. it’sworthnotingthat(7.6)alsoholdsinfinitedimensions, buttherearenodimension-dependent constants appearing in it. 58 a concise way of stating the log sobolev inequality is to say t hat d1,2⊂l2lnl wherel2lnl, by analogy with lp, represents the set of measurable functions fwith/integraltext |f|2ln|f|< ∞. this is called an orlicz space; one can play this game to defin eφ(l) spaces for a variety of reasonable functions φ. our proof of the log sobolev inequality hinges on the followi ng completely innocuous looking commutation relation. lemma 7.17. forf∈d1,2,dttf=e−tttdf. you mayobjectthat ontherightsideweareapplying tt, anoperatoronthereal-valued function spacel2(w), to theh-valued function df. okay then: we can define ttonl2(w;h) in any of the following ways: 1. componentwise: ttu=/summationtext i(tt/a\\}b∇acketle{tu(·),hi/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth)(x)hiwherehiis an orthonormal basis for h. 2. via (7.3), replacing the lebesgue integral with bochner. 3. via(7.2): set ttu=/summationtext∞ n=0e−tnjnuwherejnisorthogonalprojectiononto hn(h)⊂l2(w;h). exercise 7.18. verify that these are all the same. also verify the inequalit y /ba∇dblttu(x)/ba∇dblh≤tt/ba∇dblu/ba∇dblh(x). (7.7) it’s worthnotingthat forany f∈l2,ttf∈d1,2. thisfollows either fromthespectraltheorem, or from the observation that for any t, the sequence {ne−2tn}is bounded, so/summationtext nn/ba∇dbljnttf/ba∇dbl2=/summationtext nne2tn/ba∇dbljnf/ba∇dbl2≤c/summationtext/ba∇dbljnf/ba∇dbl2≤c/ba∇dblf/ba∇dbl2. in fact, more is true: we have ttf∈domn, and indeedttf∈domn∞. proof of lemma 7.17. dttf=d∞/summationdisplay n=0e−tnjnf =∞/summationdisplay n=1e−tndjnf (recalldj0= 0) =∞/summationdisplay n=1e−tnjn−1df =∞/summationdisplay k=0e−t(k+1)jkdf=e−tttdf wherewere-indexedbyletting k=n−1. we’ve extendedto l2(w;h)somewiener chaosidentities that we only really proved for l2(w); as an exercise you can check the details. there’s also an infinitesimal version of this commutation: lemma 7.19. forf∈ fc∞ c(w),dnf= (n+1)df. 59 proof.differentiate the previous lemma at t= 0. or, use wiener chaos expansion. exercise 7.20. (not necessarily very interesting) characterize the set of ffor which the foregoing identity makes sense and is true. we can now prove the log sobolev inequality (7.6). this proof is taken from [19] which actually contains several proofs. proof.first, letfbe a smooth cylinder function which is bounded above and boun ded below away from 0: 0< a≤f≤b <∞. takeg=f2;ghas the same properties. note in particular that g∈domn. we have q:= 2/parenleftbigg/integraldisplay f2lnfdμ−/ba∇dblf/ba∇dbl2ln/ba∇dblf/ba∇dbl/parenrightbigg =/integraldisplay glngdμ−/integraldisplay gdμln/integraldisplay gdμ. (7.8) and we want to bound this quantity qby 2/ba∇dbldf/ba∇dbl2 l2(w;h). note that for any g∈l2(w) we have lim t→∞ttg=j0g=/integraltext gdμ. (use lemma 7.11 and monotone convergence.) so we can think of ttgas a continuous function from [0 ,∞] to l2(w). it is continuously differentiable on (0 ,∞) and has derivative −nttg=−ttng. so define a: [0,∞]→l2(w)bya(t) = (ttg)·(lnttg)(notingthatas ttismarkovian, ttgisboundedabove and below, so ( ttg)·(lnttg) is also bounded and hence in l2). thenq=/integraltext w(a(0)−a(∞))dμ. since we want to use the fundamental theorem of calculus, we u se the chain rule to see that a′(t) =−(nttg)(1+lnttg). so by the fundamental theorem of calculus, we have q=−/integraldisplay w/integraldisplay∞ 0a′(t)dtdμ =/integraldisplay w/integraldisplay∞ 0(nttg)(1+lnttg)dtdμ. there are two integrals in this expression, so of course we wa nt to interchange them. to justify this, we note that 1+ln ttgis bounded (since 0 <a2≤g≤b2andttis markovian, we also have a2≤ttg≤b2)), and so it is enough to bound /integraldisplay w/integraldisplay∞ 0|nttg|dtdμ=/integraldisplay∞ 0/ba∇dblnttg/ba∇dbll1(w,μ)dt ≤/integraldisplay∞ 0/ba∇dblnttg/ba∇dbll2(w,μ)dt since/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dbll1≤ /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dbll2over a probability measure (cauchy–schwarz or jensen). not e thatnttg= ttngis continuous from [0 ,∞] tol2(w,μ), so/ba∇dblnttg/ba∇dbll2(w)is continuous in tand hence bounded on compact sets. so we only have to worry about what happens fo r larget. but corollary 7.12 says that it decays exponentially, and so is integrable. (no te that/integraltext ngdμ=/a\\}b∇acketle{tng,1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w)= /a\\}b∇acketle{tdg,d1/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w)= 0.) 60 so after applying fubini’s theorem, we get q=/integraldisplay∞ 0/integraldisplay w(nttg)(1+lnttg)dμdt =/integraldisplay∞ 0/a\\}b∇acketle{tnttg,1+lnttg/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w)dt. now sincen=δdwe have, using the chain rule, /a\\}b∇acketle{tnttg,1+lnttg/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w)=/a\\}b∇acketle{tdttg,✟✟d1+dlnttg/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w;h) =/a\\}b∇acketle{tdttg,dttg ttg/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w;h) =/integraldisplay w1 ttg/ba∇dbldttg/ba∇dbl2 hdμ =e−2t/integraldisplay w1 ttg/ba∇dblttdg/ba∇dbl2 hdμ where we have just used the commutation dtt=e−tttd. let’s look at /ba∇dblttdg/ba∇dbl2 h. noting that dg= 2fdf, we have /ba∇dblttdg/ba∇dbl2 h≤(tt/ba∇dbldg/ba∇dblh)2by (7.7) = 4(tt(f/ba∇dbldf/ba∇dblh))2 ≤4(tt(f2))(tt/ba∇dbldf/ba∇dbl2 h) by (7.4) . thus we have reached /integraldisplay w1 ttg/ba∇dblttdg/ba∇dbl2 hdμ≤4/integraldisplay wtt/ba∇dbldf/ba∇dbl2 hdμ. but sincettis self-adjoint and tt1 = 1 (or, if you like, the fact that ttcommutes with j0, we have/integraltext wttfdμ=/integraltext fdμfor anyt. thus/integraltext wtt/ba∇dbldf/ba∇dbl2 hdμ=/integraltext w/ba∇dbldf/ba∇dbl2 hdμ=/ba∇dbldf/ba∇dbl2 l2(w;h). so we have q≤/parenleftbigg 4/integraldisplay∞ 0e−2tdt/parenrightbigg /ba∇dbldf/ba∇dbl2 l2(w;h) the parenthesized constant equals 2 (consult a math 1120 stu dent if in doubt). this is what we wanted. toextendthistoall f∈d1,2, weneedsomedensityarguments. supposenowthat fisasmooth cylinder function which is bounded, say |f| ≤m. fixǫ>0, and for each nletφn∈c∞(r) be a positive smooth function, such that: 1.φnis bounded away from 0; 2.φn≤m; 3.φ′ n| ≤1+ǫ; 4.φn(x)→ |x|pointwise on [ −m,m]. 61 thusφn(f) is a smooth cylinder function, bounded away from 0 and bound ed above, so it satisfies the log sobolev inequality. since φn(f)→ |f|pointwise and boundedly, we have /ba∇dblφn(f)/ba∇dbll2(w)→ /ba∇dblf/ba∇dbll2(w)by dominated convergence. we also have, by the chain rule, /ba∇dbldφn(f)/ba∇dbll2(w;h)≤(1+ ǫ)/ba∇dbldf/ba∇dbll2(w;h). thus limsup n→∞/integraldisplay wφn(f)2lnφn(f)dμ≤ /ba∇dblf/ba∇dbl2ln/ba∇dblf/ba∇dbl+(1+ǫ)/ba∇dbldf/ba∇dbl2. now sincex2lnxis continuous, we have φn(f)2lnφn(f)→ |f|2ln|f|pointwise. since x2lnxis bounded below, fatou’s lemma gives /integraldisplay w|f|2ln|f|dμ≤liminf n→∞/integraldisplay wφn(f)2lnφn(f)dμ and so this case is done after we send ǫ→0. (dominated convergence could also have been used, which would give equality in the last line.) finally, let f∈d1,2. we can find a sequence of bounded cylinder functions fnsuch that fn→finl2(w) anddfn→dfinl2(w;h). passing to a subsequence, we can also assume thatfn→f μ-a.e., and we use fatou’s lemma as before to see that the log so bolev inequality holds in the limit. note that we mostly just used properties that are true for any markovian semigroup ttthat is conservative ( tt1 = 1). the only exception was the commutation dtt=e−tttd. in fact, an inequality like /ba∇dbldttf/ba∇dblh≤c(t)tt/ba∇dbldf/ba∇dblhwould have been good enough, provided that c(t) is appropriately integrable. (one of the main results in my the sis was to prove an inequality like this for a certain finite-dimensional lie group, in order to obtai n a log-sobolev inequality by precisely this method.) also, you might wonder: since the statement of the log-sobol ev inequality only involved dand μ, why did we drag the ornstein–uhlenbeck semigroup into it? r eally the only reason was the fact thatt∞f=/integraltext fdμ, which is just saying that ttis the semigroup of a markov process whose distribution at a certain time t0(we tookt0=∞) is the measure μwe want to use. if we want to prove this theorem in finite dimensions, we could instead u se the heat semigroup pt(which is symmetric with respect to lebesgue measure) and take t= 1, beak brownian motion at time 1 also has a standard gaussian distribution. 8 absolute continuity and smoothness of distributions this section will just hint at some of the very important appl ications of malliavin calculus to proving absolute continuity results. when presented with a random variable (or random vector) x, a very basic question is “what is its distribution?”, i.e. what is ν(a) :=p(x∈a) for borel sets a? a more basic question is “doesxhas a continuous distribution?”, i.e. is νabsolutely continuous to lebesgue measure? if so, it has a radon–nikodym derivative f∈l1(m), which is a density function for x. it may happen that fis continuous or ckorc∞, in which case so much the better. given a brownian motion btor similar process, one can cook up lots of complicated rando m variables whose distributions may be very hard to work out. f or example: 62 •x=f(bt) for some fixed t(this is not so hard) •x=f(bt) for some stopping time t •x= supt∈[0,1]bt •x=/integraltext1 0ytdbt •x=zt, wherezis the solution to some sde dzt=f(zt)dbt. malliavin calculus gives us some tools to learn something ab out the absolute continuity of such random variables, and the smoothness of their densities. let (w,h,μ) bean abstract wiener space. a measurable function f:w→ris then a random variable, and we can ask about its distribution. if we’re goi ng to use malliavin calculus, we’d better concentrate on f∈d1,p. an obvious obstruction to absolute continuity would be if fis constant on some set aof positiveμ-measure; in this case, as we have previously shown, df= 0 ona. the following theorem says if we ensure that dfdoesn’t vanish, then fmust be absolutely continuous. theorem 8.1. letf∈d1,1, and suppose that dfis nonzeroμ-a.e. then the law of fis absolutely continuous to lebesgue measure. proof.letν=μ◦f−1be the law of f; our goal is to show ν≪m. byreplacing fwithsomethinglikearctan( f), wecanassumethat fisbounded; say0 ≤f≤1. so we want to show that νis absolutely continuous to lebesgue measure mon [0,1]. leta⊂[0,1] be borel with m(a) = 0; we want to show ν(a) = 0. choose a sequence gn∈c∞([0,1]) such that gn→1am+ν-a.e., and such that the gnare uniformly bounded (say |gn| ≤2). setψn(t) =/integraltextt 0gn(s)ds. thenψn∈c∞,|ψn| ≤2, andψn→0 pointwise (everywhere). in particular ψn(f)→0μ-a.e. (in fact everywhere), and thus also in l1(w,μ) by bounded convergence. on the other hand, by the chain rule, dψn(f) =gn(f)df. now since gn→1a ν-a.e., we have gn(f)→1a(f)μ-a.e., and boundedly. thus gn(f)df→1a(f)dfinl1(w;h). nowdis a closed operator, so we must have 1 a(f)df=d0 = 0. but by assumption df/\\e}atio\\slash= 0 μ-a.e., so we have to have 1 af= 0μ-a.e., that is, ν(a) = 0. so knowing that the derivative df“never” vanishes guarantees that the law of fhas a density. ifdfmostly stays away from zero in the sense that /ba∇dbldf/ba∇dbl−1 h∈lp(w) for somep, then this gives more smoothness (e.g. differentiability) for the density. se e nualart for precise statements. in higher dimensions, if we have a function f= (f1,...,fn) :w→rn, the object to look at is the “jacobian,” the matrix-valued function γf:w→rn×ndefined by γf(x)ij= /a\\}b∇acketle{tdfi(x),dfj(x)/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth. ifγfis almost everywhere nonsingular, then the law of fhas a density. if we have (det γf)−1∈lp(w) for somep, then we get more smoothness. here’s another interesting fact. recall that the support of a borel measure νon a topological space ω is by definition the set of all x∈ω such that every neighborhood of xhas nonzero ν measure. this set is closed. proposition 8.2. iff∈d1,2, then the support of the law of fis connected, i.e. is a closed interval in r. 63 proof.letν=μ◦f−1. suppose supp νis not connected. then there exists a∈rsuch that there are points of supp νto the left and right of a. since supp νis closed, there is an open interval ( a,b) in the complement of supp ν. that is, we have μ(a<f <b ) = 0 but 0 <μ(f≤a)<1. letψ∈ c∞(r) haveψ(t) = 1 fort≤aandψ(t) = 0 fort≥b, and moreover take ψand all its derivatives to be bounded. then ψ(f) = 1(−∞,a](f) = 1{f≤a}. sinceψis smooth, 1 {f≤a}=ψ(f)∈d1,2by the chain rule (lemma 6.24). by the zero-one law of propositi on 6.25,μ(f≤a) is either 0 or 1, a contradiction. as an example, let’s look at the maximum of a continuous proce ss. let (w,h,μ) be an abstract wiener space. suppose we have a process {xt:t∈[0,1]}defined onw, i.e. a measurable map x: [0,1]×w→r, which is a.s. continuous in t. (if we take w=c([0,1]) andμthe law of some continuous gaussian process yt, thenxt=yt, in other words xt(ω) =ω(t), would be an example. another natural example would be to ta ke classical wiener space and let xtbe the solution of some sde.) let m= supt∈[0,1]xt. we will show that under certain conditions, mhas an absolutely continuous law. (note you can also index {xt}by any other compact metric space sand the below proofs will go through just fine. if you take sfinite, the results are trivial. you can take s= [0,1]2and prove things about brownian sheet. you can even take sto be cantor space if you really want (hi clinton!).) lemma 8.3. supposefn∈d1,2,fn→finl2(w), andsupn/ba∇dbldfn/ba∇dbll2(w;h)<∞. thenf∈d1,2 anddfn→dfweakly inl2(w;h). proof.this is really a general fact about closed operators on hilbe rt space. since {dfn}is a bounded sequence in l2(w;h), by alaoglu’s theorem we can pass to a subsequence and assume that dfnconverges weakly in l2(w;h), to some element u. suppose v∈domδ. then /a\\}b∇acketle{tdfn,v/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w;h)=/a\\}b∇acketle{tfn,δv/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w). the left side converges to /a\\}b∇acketle{tu,v/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w;h)and the right side to /a\\}b∇acketle{tf,δv/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w). since the left side is continuous in v, we havef∈domδ∗= domd=d1,2. moreover, since we have /a\\}b∇acketle{tdfn,v/a\\}b∇acket∇i}ht → /a\\}b∇acketle{tdf,v/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htfor allvin a dense subset of l2(w;h), and{dfn}is bounded, it follows from the triangle inequality that dfn→dfweakly. since we get the same limit no matter which weakly convergent subsequence we pass ed to, it must be that the original sequencedfnalso converges weakly to df. recall, as we’ve previously argued, that if f∈d1,2, then|f| ∈d1,2also, and /ba∇dbld|f|/ba∇dblh≤ /ba∇dbldf/ba∇dblha.e. (approximate |t|by smooth functions with uniformly bounded derivatives.) i t follows that iff1,f2∈d1,2, thenf1∧f2,f1∨f2∈d1,2also. (f1∧f2=f1+f2− |f1−f2|, and f1∨f2=f1+f2+|f1−f2|.) then by iteration, if f1,...,f n∈d1,2, then min kfk,maxkfk∈d1,2 as well. lemma 8.4. supposex,mare as above, and: 1./integraltext wsupt∈[0,1]|xt(ω)|2μ(dω)<∞; 2. for any t∈[0,1],xt∈d1,2; 3. theh-valued process dxthas an a.s. continuous version (which we henceforth fix); 4./integraltext wsupt∈[0,1]/ba∇dbldxt(ω)/ba∇dbl2 hμ(dω)<∞. 64 thenm∈d1,2. proof.the first property guarantees m∈l2(w). enumerate the rationals in [0 ,1] as{qn}. set mn= max{xq1,...,x qn}. thenmn∈d1,2(using item 2). clearly mn↑mso by monotone convergence mn→minl2(w). it suffices now to show that supn/ba∇dbldmn/ba∇dbll2(w;h)<∞. fixn, and fork= 1,...,nletakbe the set of all ωwhere the maximum in mnis achieved by xqk, with ties going to the smaller k. that is, a1={ω:xq1(ω) =mn(ω)} a2={ω:xq1(ω)/\\e}atio\\slash=mn(ω),xq2(ω) =mn(ω)} ... an={ω:xq1(ω)/\\e}atio\\slash=mn(ω),...,x qn−1(ω)/\\e}atio\\slash=mn(ω),xqn(ω) =mn(ω)} clearly the akare borel and partition w, andmn=xqkonak. by the local property of d, we havedmn=dxqka.e. onak. in particular, /ba∇dbldmn/ba∇dblh≤supt∈[0,1]/ba∇dbldxt/ba∇dblha.e. squaring and integrating both sides, we are done by the last assumption. exercise 8.5. let{xt,t∈[0,1]}be a continuous centered gaussian process. then we can take w=c([0,1]) (or a closed subspace thereof) and μto be the law of the process, and define xton wbyxt(ω) =ω(t). verify that the hypotheses of proposition 8.4 are satisfie d. proposition 8.6. supposextsatisfies the hypotheses of the previous theorem, and moreov er μ({ω:xt(ω) =m(ω) =⇒dxt(ω)/\\e}atio\\slash= 0}) = 1. (note we are fixing continuous versions of xtanddxtso the above expression makes sense.) then dm/\\e}atio\\slash= 0a.e. andmhas an absolutely continuous law. proof.it is enough to show μ({ω:xt(ω) =m(ω) =⇒dxt(ω) =dm(ω)}) = 1. call the above set a. (note that for every fixed ω,m(ω) =xt(ω) for somet.) letebe a countable dense subset of h. for fixed r,s∈q,h∈e,k>0, let gr,s,h,k={ω: sup t∈(r,s)xt(ω) =m(ω),/a\\}b∇acketle{tdxt(ω)−dm(ω),h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth≥1 nfor allr<t<s }. enumerate the rationals in ( r,s) as{qi}. if we let m′= supt∈(r,s)xt,m′ n= max{xq1,...,x qn}, then as we argued before, m′ n→m′inl2(w), anddm′ n→dm′weakly inl2(w;h). on the other hand, by the local property used before, for every ωthere is some tiwithdm′ n=dxti. thus forω∈gr,s,h,kwe have /a\\}b∇acketle{tdm′ n(ω)−dm′(ω),h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth≥1 nfor allr < t < s . integrating this inequality, we have /a\\}b∇acketle{tdm′ n−dm′,h1gr,s,h,k/a\\}b∇acket∇i}htl2(w;h)≥1 nμ(gr,s,h,k) for alln. the left side goes to 0 by weak convergence, so it must be that μ(gr,s,h,k) = 0. however,ac=/uniontextgr,s,h,kwhichisacountableunion. (if ω∈ac, thereexists tsuchthatxt(ω) = m(ω) butdxt(ω)/\\e}atio\\slash=dm(ω). as such, there must exist h∈ewith/a\\}b∇acketle{tdxt(ω)−dm(ω),h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth/\\e}atio\\slash= 0; by replacing hby−hor something very close to it, we can assume /a\\}b∇acketle{tdxt(ω)−dm(ω),h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth>0. as dxtis assumed continuous, thereexists ( r,s)∈qandk>0 such that /a\\}b∇acketle{tdxt(ω)−dm(ω),h/a\\}b∇acket∇i}hth>1 k for allt∈(r,s). so we have ω∈gr,s,h,k.) 65 exercise 8.7. again letxtbe a centered gaussian process as in exercise 8.5 above. give an example of a process for which mdoes not have an absolutely continuous law. however, show th at ifp(m= 0) = 0, then the hypothesis of proposition 8.6 is satisfied. ( can we show this always holds whenever xtis strong markov?) a miscellaneous lemmas lemma a.1. lety∈r∞, and suppose that/summationtexty(i)g(i)converges for every g∈l2. theny∈l2. proof.for eachn, lethn∈(l2)∗be the bounded linear functional hn(g) =/summationtextn i=1y(i)g(i). by assumption, for each g∈l2, the sequence {hn(g)}converges; in particular supn|hn(g)|<∞. so by the uniform boundedness principle, supn||hn||(l2)∗<∞. but||hn||2 (l2)∗=/summationtextn i=1|y(i)|2, so/summationtext∞ i=1|y(i)|2= supn||hn||2 (l2)∗<∞andy∈l2. for an elementary, constructive proof, see also [17]. lemma a.2. lethbe a separable hilbert space and e⊂ha dense subspace. there exists an orthonormal basis {ei}forhwith{ei} ⊂e. proof.choose a sequence {xi} ⊂ewhich is dense in h. (to see that this is possible, let {yk} be a countable dense subset of h, and choose one xiinside each ball b(yk,1/m).) then apply gram-schmidt to xito get an orthonormal sequence {ei} ⊂ewithxn∈span{e1,...,en}. then since{xi} ⊂span{ei}, span{ei}is dense in h, so{ei}is an orthonormal basis for h. lemma a.3. letxn∼n(0,σ2 n)be a sequence of mean-zero gaussian random variables conver ging in distribution to a finite random variable x. thenxis also gaussian, with mean zero and variance σ2= limσ2 n(and the limit exists). proof.supposeσ2 nkis asubsequenceof σ2 nconverging to some σ2∈[0,+∞]. (by compactness, such a subsequence must exist.) now taking fourier transforms, w e havee−λ2σ2 n/2=e[eiλxn]→e[eiλx] for eachx, soe[eiλx] =e−λ2σ2/2. moreover, the fourier transform of xmust be continuous and equal 1 atλ= 0, which rules out the case σ2= +∞. sox∼n(0,σ2). since we get the same σ2 no matter which convergent subsequence of σ2 nwe start with, σ2 nmust converge to σ2. lemma a.4. letμbe any finite borel measure on [0,1]. thenc∞([0,1])is dense in lp([0,1],μ). proof.use dynkin’s multiplicative system theorem. let mconsist of all μ-versions of all bounded measurablefunctionsintheclosureof c∞inlp(μ). thenmis avector spaceclosed underbounded convergence (since bounded convergence implies lp(μ) convergence) and it contains c∞([0,1]). by dynkin’s theorem, mcontains all bounded f-measurable functions, where fis the smallest σalgebra that makes all functions from c∞([0,1]) measurable. but the identity function f(x) =x is inc∞. so for any borel set b, we must have b=f−1(b)∈ f. thusfis actually the borel σ-algebra, and mcontains all bounded measurable functions. since the bound ed functions are certainly dense in lp(μ) (by dominated convergence), we are done. 66 b radon measures definition b.1. a finite borel measure μon a topological space wis said to be radonif for every borel set b, we have μ(b) = sup{μ(k) :k⊂b,kcompact} (b.1) (we say that such a set bisinner regular ). equivalently, μis radon if for every borel set band everyǫ>0, there exists a compact k⊂bwithμ(b\\k)<ǫ. proposition b.2. ifxis a compact metric space, every finite borel measure on xis radon. proof.let (x,d) be a compact metric space, and μa borel measure. let fdenote the collection of all borel sets bsuch thatbandbcare both inner regular. i claim fis aσ-algebra. clearly ∅ ∈ fandfis also closed under complements. if b1,b2,··· ∈ fare disjoint, and b=/uniontext nbnthen since/summationtext nμ(bn) =μ(b)<∞, there exists nso large that/summationtext∞ n=nμ(bn)< ǫ. forn= 1,...,n, choose a compact kn⊂bnwithμ(bn\\kn)<ǫ/n. then ifk=/uniontextn n=1kn,kis compact, k⊂b, andμ(b\\k)<2ǫ. sobis inner regular. next,fcontains all open sets u. for any open set umay be written as a countable union of compact sets kn. (for every x∈uthere is an open ball b(x,rx) contained in u, hence b(x,rx/2)⊂ualso. since xis second countable we can find a basic open set vxwithx∈vx⊂ b(x,rx/2), sovx⊂u. thenu=/uniontext x∈uvx. but this union actually contains only countably many distinct sets.) thus by countable additivity, uis inner regular. ucis compact and so obviously inner regular. thus u∈ f. sincefis aσ-algebra and contains all open sets, it contains all borel sets. proposition b.3. every complete separable metric space (x,d)is homeomorphic to a borel subset of the compact metric space [0,1]∞. proof.without loss of generality, assume d≤1. fix a dense sequence x1,x2,...inxand for eachx∈x, setf(x) = (d(x,x1),d(x,x2),...)∈[0,1]∞. it is easy to check that fis continuous. fis also injective: for any x∈xwe can choose a subsequence xnk→x, so thatd(xnk,x)→0. then iff(x) =f(y), thend(xn,x) =d(xn,y) for alln, soxnk→yas well, and x=y. finally, fhas a continuous inverse. suppose f(ym)→f(y). choose an xnsuch thatd(xn,y)< ǫ. we havef(ym)n=d(xn,ym)→d(xn,y) =f(y)n, so for sufficiently large m,d(ym,xn)< ǫ, and by the triangle inequality d(ym,y)<2ǫ. lastly, we check f(x) is borel. well, this theorem is standard and i’m too lazy to w rite it out. see, e.g. srivastava’s a course on borel sets , section 2.2. corollary b.4. any finite borel measure μon a complete separable metric space xis radon. proof.letfbe the above embedding of xinto [0,1]∞. thenμ◦f−1defines a borel measure on f(x). we can extend it to a borel measure on [0 ,1]∞by setting ̃μ(b) =μ(f−1(b∩f(x))), i.e. ̃μassigns measure zero to all sets outside f(x). then we know that ̃ μis radon and hence so is μ. exercise b.5. as a corollary of this, for any borel probability measure on a polish space, there is a sequence of compact sets knsuch thatμ(/uniontextkn) = 1. this is perhaps surprising because compact sets in an infinite dimensional banach space are very thin; in particular they are nowhere dense. for classical wiener space with wiener measure, find explici t setsknwith this property. (hint: think of some well-known sample path properties of brownian motion.) 67 c miscellaneous exercises exercise c.1. letxbe a set, and let τsandτwbe two topologies on xsuch thatτw⊂τs.τwis said to be “weaker” or “coarser,” while τsis “stronger” or “finer.” fill in the following chart. here a⊂x, andy,zare some other topological spaces. all terms such as “more,” “less,” “larger,” “smaller” should be under stood in the sense of implication or containment. for instance, since every set which is open in τwis also open in τs, we might say τs has “more” open sets and τwhas “fewer.” property τwτschoices open sets more / fewer closed sets more / fewer dense sets more / fewer compact sets more / fewer connected sets more / fewer closure ̄a larger / smaller interiora◦larger / smaller precompact sets more / fewer separable sets more / fewer continuous functions x→y more / fewer continuous functions z→x more / fewer identity map continuous (x,τs)→(x,τw) or vice versa convergent sequences more / fewer exercise c.2. now suppose that xis a vector space, and τw⊂τsare generated by two norms /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblw,/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dbls. also lety,zbe other normed spaces. property /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblw/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblschoices size of norm /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dbls≤c/ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblwor vice versa, or neither closed (unbounded) operators x→y more / fewer closed (unbounded) operators z→x more / fewer cauchy sequences more / fewer exercise c.3. give an example where xis complete in /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblsbut not in /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblw. exercise c.4. give an example where xis complete in /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dblwbut not in /ba∇dbl·/ba∇dbls.
