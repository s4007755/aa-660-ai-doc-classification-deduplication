Waite, Emma Lovell\nRelatives\nFrederika Waite\nArthur Edward Waite (October 2, 1857 – May 19, 1942) was a scholarly mystic who wrote extensively on occult\nand esoteric matters, and was the co-creator of the Rider-Waite Tarot deck. As his biographer, R.A. Gilbert described\nhim, \"Waite's name has survived because he was the first to attempt a systematic study of the history of western\noccultism—viewed as a spiritual tradition rather than as aspects of proto-science or as the pathology of religion.\"[1]\nEarly life\nWaite was born in the United States.[2] Waite's father, Capt. Charles F. Waite, died when he was very young, and his\nwidowed mother, Emma Lovell, returned to her home country of England, where he was then raised.[3] As they were\nnot well off, Waite was educated at a small private school in North London. When he was 13, he was then educated\nat St. Charles' College.[4] When he left school to become a clerk he wrote verse in his spare time. The death of his\nsister, Frederika Waite, in 1874 soon attracted him into psychical research. At 21, he began to read regularly in the\nLibrary of the British Museum, studying many branches of esotericism.\nWhen Waite was almost 30, he married Ada Lakeman (also called \"Lucasta\") and they had one daughter, Sybil.[5]\nSome time after Lucasta's death in 1924, Waite married Mary Broadbent Schofield. He spent most of his life in or\nnear London, connected to various publishing houses, and editing a magazine The Unknown World.\n\nA. E. Waite\n2\nWaite photographed in London, January 13,\n 1921.\n \n Career\n \n Golden Dawn\n Waite joined the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in January 1891\nafter being introduced by E.W. Berridge.[6] He became a Freemason in\n1901,[7][8] and entered the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia in 1902.\nThe Golden Dawn was torn by internal feuding until Waite's departure\nin 1914; later he formed the Fellowship of the Rosy Cross,[9] not to be\nconfused with the Societas Rosicruciana. By that time there existed\nsome half-dozen offshoots from the original Golden Dawn, and as a\nwhole it never recovered.[10]\n Aleister Crowley, Waite's foe, referred to him as a villainous\n\"Arthwate\" in his novel Moonchild and referred to him in his magazine\nEquinox. Lovecraft has a villainous wizard in his short story \"The\nThing on the Doorstep\" called Ephraim Waite; according to Robert M.\nPrice this character was based on Waite.[11]\n \nAuthor and scholar\nWaite was a prolific author with many of his works being well received in academic circles. He wrote occult texts on\nsubjects including divination, esotericism, Rosicrucianism, Freemasonry, and ceremonial magic, Kabbalism and\nalchemy; he also translated and reissued several important mystical and alchemical works. His works on the Holy\nGrail, influenced by his friendship with Arthur Machen, were particularly notable.[12][13] A number of his volumes\nremain in print, The Book of Ceremonial Magic (1911), The Holy Kabbalah (1929), A New Encyclopedia of\nFreemasonry (1921), and his edited translation of Eliphas Levi's Transcendental Magic, its Doctrine and Ritual\n(1896) among others by Levi, having seen reprints in recent years.\nTarot deck\nWaite is best known as the co-creator of the popular and widely used Rider-Waite Tarot deck and author of its\ncompanion volume, the Key to the Tarot, republished in expanded form the following year, 1911, as the Pictorial\nKey to the Tarot, a guide to Tarot reading.[14] The Rider-Waite-Smith tarot was notable for being one of the first\ntarot decks to illustrate all 78 cards fully, in addition to the 22 major arcana cards. Golden Dawn member Pamela\nColman Smith illustrated the cards for Waite, and the deck was first published in 1909. It remains in publication\ntoday.\n\nA. E.
