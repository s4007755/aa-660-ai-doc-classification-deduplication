Describe what happens during telophase. [4 marks] \n \nDuring telophase, the chromosomes, at either end of the cell begin to unwind into chromatin. The spindle fibers  \ndissolve, and a nuclear membrane forms around the chromatin.  The cytoplasm begins to divide (cytokinesis) and the  \ncell membrane pinches off forming two identical cells, each with a full set of chromosomes.  \n \n 2. What is cytokinesis?
