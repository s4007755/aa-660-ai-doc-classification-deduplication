This ATP provides employment of the \nSBCT Infantry rifle company in decisive action. \nThis ATP provides doctrinal guidance for commanders, staff, and leaders who are responsible for planning, \npreparing, executing, and assessing operations of the SBCT Infantry rifle company. It serves as an authoritative \nreference for personnel developing, materiel and force structure, institutional and unit training, and standard \noperating procedures (SOP) for SBCT Infantry rifle company operations. This ATP supplements the doctrinal \nmaterial found in FM 3-96 .  \nCommanders, staffs, and subordinates ensure that their decisions and actions comply with applicable United \nStates, international, and in some cases host-nation laws and regulations. Commanders at all levels ensure that \ntheir Soldiers operate in accordance with the law of war and the rules of engagement. (See FM 27-10.) \nATPs contain techniques that are nonprescriptive ways or methods used to perform missions, functions, or \ntasks. They are intended to be used as a guide to supplement doctrinal material published in active Field \nManuals. This ATP outlines the framework that the SBCT Infantry rifle company will operate separately or as \npart of a combined arms team. It includes discussions of doctrine that is applicable to all companies. \nATP 3-21.11 uses joint terms where applicable. Selected joint and Army terms and definitions appear in both \nthe glossary and the text. Terms for which ATP 3-21.11 is the proponent publication (the authority) are \nitalicized in the text and are marked with an asterisk (*) in the glossary. Terms and definitions for which \nATP 3-21.11 is the proponent publication are boldfaced in the text. For definitions shown in the text, the term is \nitalicized and the number of the proponent publication follows the definition. This publication applies to the \nActive Army, the Army National Guard/Army National Guard of the United States (ARNGUS), and the United \nStates (U.S.) Army Reserve, unless otherwise stated.  \nUnless otherwise stated, whenever the masculine gender is used, both men and women are implied. \nThe proponent for this publication is the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). The \npreparing agency is the U.S. Army Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE).

These are techniques and are not prescriptive. Mission, enemy, \nterrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, and civil \nconsiderations (METT-TC) condition will dictate how the company commander \naccomplishes his tasks. This manual provides the commander and his subordinates \nwith an array of methods that can be used or modified. \nA TP 3-21.11 has eight chapters and one appendix. The chapters consist of an \norganizational chapter and a chapter on offense, defense, and stability operations. \nDefense support to civilian authorities and defense support of civil authority (DSCA) \nis not covered. Throughout the chapters, tactical enabling operations are included in \nthe discussions. The chapters and the appendix use examples and illustrations to \nshow techniques that can be used. Doctrine is included only to the extent of \nunderstanding the context and relationships between techniques. \nThe following text below compares the table of contents of A TP 3-21.11 and \nFM 3-21.11. The chapters and sections of FM 3-21.11 are reorganized and updated to \nadhere to the standards of an A TP. For parts of FM 3-21.11 that have no \ncorresponding discussion in the A TP, the applicable publication is listed in \nparenthesis. This manual incorporates the significant changes in Army doctrinal \nterminology, concepts, constructs, and proven tactics developed during recent \noperations. It also incorporates doctrinal terms and changes based on Doctrine 2015.  \nNote.  This manual is written based on the current structure of the SBCT and its subordinate \nunits. The organizational charts in chapter 1 illustrate the structure of the SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany for this publication. Future changes to the organizational structures of the SBCT \nInfantry rifle company will be published as change documents to the manual. \nThe following is a brief introduction and summary of changes by chapter. \nChapter 1 – Organization \nChapter 1 addresses the organizational characteristics of the SBCT Infantry rifle company as optimized and \ntrained to conduct offensive and defensive tasks, and operations in support of stability to function across the \nrange of military operations. Chapter 1 describes the organization and mission of the company, each of its \nsubordinate elements as well as the duties and responsibilities of its key leaders. \nChapter 2 – Offense \nChapter 2 discusses offensive actions to destroy, defeat, or neutralize the enemy. The chapter addresses the \ncharacteristics of a SBCT Infantry rifle company offense and describes the movement to contact, attack tasks, \nand considerations when participating in exploitation, and pursuit. Chapter 2 also discusses — \nCommon offensive planning considerations.\nForms of maneuver. (Adds sixth form of maneu ver “flan attack”.)\nPlanning considerations when transitioning to other tactical operations.\nNote.  ADRP 3 90, dated 31 August 2012, adds a sixth form of maneuver, flank attack. \nIntroduction \nx  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016Chapter 3 – Defense \nChapter 3 discusses defensive actions to defeat enemy attacks, buy time, control key terrain, protect critical \ninfrastructure, secure the population, and economize forces.

The SBCT Infantry rifle company can be deployed \nrapidly and can be sustained by an austere support structure for up to 72 hours of \nindependent operations . SBCT conducts operations against threat forces in all types \nof terrain and weather conditions. The SBCT Infantry rifle company is ready to adapt \nto various environments. This requires bold, aggressive, resourceful, and adaptive \nleaders who are willing to accept prudent risks to accomplish the mission. This \nchapter emphasizes the role, organization, capabilities, duties and responsibilities \nwithin the SBCT Infantry rifle company. \nSECTION I – OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW \n1-1. An operation is a series of tactical actions with a common purpose or unifying theme. A tactical \naction is a battle or engagement, employing lethal or nonlethal actions, designed for a specific purpose \nrelative to the enemy, the terrain, friendly forces, or other entity. Tactical actions include widely varied \nactivities such as an attack to seize a piece of terrain or destroy an enemy unit, the defense of a population , \nand the training of other militaries to assist security forces as part of building partner capacity. \nUNIFIED LAND OPERATIONS \n1-2. Unified land operations  describes how the Army seizes, retains, and exploits the initiative to gain \nand maintain a position of relative advantage in sustained land operations. Through decisive action \n(simultaneous combination of offensive, defensive, and stability tasks) unified land operations can prevent \nor deter conflict, prevail in war, and create the conditions for favorable conflict resolution.  \n1-3. A unified land operation is the Army’s operational concept and the Army’s contribution to unified \naction. The four foundations of unified land operations are initiative, decisive action, Army core \ncompetencies (wide area security and combined arms maneuver), and mission command. (Refer to \nADRP 3-0 for a more in-depth discussion of unified land operations and its tenets.) The SBCT Infantry \nrifle company supports the Army’s operational concept with their organization, equipment, capabiliti es, \nleadership, training, and Soldiers. \nOPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT \n1-4. The operational environment  is a composite of the conditions, circumstances, and influences that \naffect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander (Joint Publication \n(JP) 3-0). The operational environment of the Infantry battalion includes all enemy, adversarial, friendly, \nand neutral systems across the range of military operations. The operational environment includes an \nunderstanding of the physical environment, the state of governance, technology, local resources, and the \nculture of the local population. The operational environment for each operation is different, and it evolves \nas the operation progresses. The company must train agile and adaptive leaders who can understand, adapt, \nand successfully operate within the current operational environment. \n1-5. When the Infantry company is alerted for deployment, redeployment within a theater of operations, \nor assigned a mission, its assigned higher headquarters provides an analysis of the operational environment. \nThat analysis includes the operational variables: political, military, economic, social, information, \ninfrastructure, physical environment, and time (PMESII-PT ). \nChapter 1 \n1-2  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  1-6. Upon receipt of a mission, the commander assisted by his company intelligence support team \n(COIST) if formed, filter information categorized by the operational variables into relevant information \nwith respect to the mission. Leaders use the mission variables to analyze missions enabling them to \ncombine operational variables and tactical-level information with knowledge about local conditions \nrelevant to their mission. The mission variables are: METT- TC. Refer to ADRP 6.0 for more information. \nTHREAT \n1-7. A threat is any combination of actors, entities, or forces that have the capability and intent to harm \nUnited States forces, United States national interests, or the homeland (ADRP 3-0) . Threats may include \nindividuals, groups of individuals (organized or not organized), paramilitary or military forces, nation-\nstates, or national alliances. When threats execute their capability to do harm to the United States, they \nbecome enemies. It is critical that the SBCT Infantry rifle company understands the threat in their \noperational environment.  \n1-8. In general, the various actors in any operational area can qualify as a threat, an enemy, an adversary, \na neutral, or a friend. An enemy is a party identified as hostile against which the use of force is authorized \n(ADRP 3-0). An enemy is also called a combatant and is treated as such under the law of war. An \nadversary  is a party acknowledged as potentially hostile to a friendly party and against which the use of \nforce may be envisaged (JP 3-0). An adversary becomes an enemy when friendly forces take action against \nthem. A neutral is a party identified as neither supporting nor opposing friendly or enemy forces. Land \noperations often prove complex because a threat, an enemy, an adversary, a neutral, or a friend intermix, \noften with no easy means to distinguish one from another. The SBCT Infantry rifle company must engage \nwith the various actors to determine categories they may display characteristics of. Building relationships \nand trust is key to influencing neutral and adversaries from moving towards the enemy goals .  \nHYBRID THREAT  \n1-9. The term hybrid threat has evolved to capture the seemingly increased complexity of operations, the \nmultiplicity of actors involved, and the blurring between traditional elements of conflict. A hybrid threat is \nthe diverse and dynamic combination of regular forces, irregular forces, terrorist forces, or criminal \nelements unified to achieve mutually benefitting effects. Hybrid threats combine regular forces governed \nby international law, military tradition, and custom with unregulated forces that act with no restrictions on \nviolence or their targets. These may involve nation-state actors that employ protracted forms of warfare, \npossibly using proxy forces to coerce and intimidate, or nonstate actors using operational concepts and \nhigh-end capabilities traditionally associated with states. Such varied forces and capabilities enable hybrid \nthreats to capitalize on perceived vulnerabilities, making them particularly effective. (Refer to ADRP 3-0 \nfor more information.) \n1-10. Today and in the future, the SBCT will be called upon to fight and win against regular forces, \nirregular forces , terrorist forces, and criminal elements that employ unconventional and terrorist tactics, and \nhybrid threats that combine conventional, unconventional, and terrorist capabilities and methods to meet \ntheir strategic goals and political aims.  \nTHREAT CAPABILITIES , TACTICS , AND TECHNIQUES  \n1-11. Current and future enemies and adversaries will seek to counter U.S. advantages in information \ncollection capabilities, long-range precision fires, armor protection and mobility, communications, and \ncombined-arms integration by employing a series of integrated tactical and technical countermeasures. \nEnemy tactical countermeasures will consist of deception operations, dispersion, concealment, and the \nintermingling with civilians in urban terrain. Complementing these tactical techniques, the enemy will \nemploy technological countermeasures such as cyber attacks and global positioning system jamming to \nevade and disrupt U.S. forces’ ability to develop the situation,  seize the initiative, and consolidate tactical \ngains into favorable political outcomes. \nUNIFIED  ACTION \n1-12. Unified action is the synchronization, coordination, and/or integration of the activities of \ngovernmental and nongovernmental entities with military operations to achieve unity of effort (JP 1). As \nmilitary forces synchronize actions, they achieve unity of effort. Unified action includes actions of military \nOrganization and Capabilities \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 1-3 forces synchronized with activities of other government agencies, nongovernmental and intergovernmental \norganizations, and the private sector. Military forces play a key role in unified action before, during, and \nafter operations through engagement. The Army’s contribution to unified action is unified land operations.  \n1-13. Army forces coordinate operations with unified action partners. Unified action partners are those \nmilitary forces, governmental and nongovernmental organizations, and elements of the private sector with \nwhom Army forces plan, coordinate, synchronize, and integrate during the conduct of operations. Unified \naction partners include joint forces and components, multinational forces, and U.S. government agencies \nand departments (ADRP 3-0). \nFOUNDATIONS OF UNIFIED LAND OPERATIONS \n1-14. Commanders can achieve strategic success by integrating the four foundations of unified land \noperations initiative, decisive action, core competencies, and mission command. The foundations of unified \nland operations begin and end with the exercise of individual and operational initiative.  \nINITIATIVE  \n1-15. All Army operations aim to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative and achieve decisive results. \nOperational initiative is setting or dictating the terms of action throughout an operation. Individual \ninitiative is the willingness to act in the absence of orders, when existing orders no longer fit the situation, \nor when unforeseen opportunities or threats arise (ADRP 3-0). Initiative gives all operations the spirit, if \nnot the form, of the offense. It originates in the principle of war of the offensive. This principle goes \nbeyond simply attacking. It requires action to change the situation on the ground. Risk and opportunity are \nintrinsic in seizing the initiative. To seize the initiative, commanders evaluate and take prudent risks as \nnecessary to exploit opportunities. Initiative requires constant effort to control tempo and momentum while \nmaintaining freedom of action. This offensive mindset, with its focus on initiative, is central to the Army’s \noperational concept and guides all leaders in the performance of their duty. It emphasizes opportunity \ncreated by developing the situation through decisive action, whether in offensive, defensive, stability, or \ndefense support of civil authority’s tasks ( refer to ADRP 3-0 for more information).  \nDECISIVE A CTION  \n1-16. The Stryker Infantry rifle company is optimally designed to conduct decisive action through its \nequipment and task organization in every theat er of conflict. Decisive action requires continuous, \nsimultaneous combinations of offensive , defensive, stability, and defense support of civil authorities’  tasks . \nSBCT Infantry rifle companies are prepared to conduct any combination of these elements (described \nbelow) either independently, or as part of a larger force. (Refer to ADRP 3-0 for more information.)  \nOffensive Tasks \n1-17. An offensive task  is a task conducted to defeat and destroy enemy forces and seize terrain, resources, \nand population centers (ADRP 3-0). They impose the commander’s will on the enemy. Seizing and \nretaining the initiative requires executing offensive tasks at some point even when conducting defensive \ntasks. They accomplish this through using mission command to direct and coordinate tasks that allow them \nto see the threat first, maneuver to a position of advantage and finish decisively. \nDefensive Tasks \n1-18. A defensive task  is a task conducted to defeat an enemy attack, gain time, economize forces, and \ndevelop conditions favorable for offensive or stability tasks (ADRP 3-0). Successful defenses are \naggressive and commanders use all available means to disrupt enemy forces. The SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany uses the defense to occupy territory and initiate mass effects on enemy forces to repel their assault \nby fire, close combat, and counterattack. \nStability Tasks \n1-19. Stability tasks  include various missions, tasks, and activities conducted outside the U.S. These tasks \nare coordinated with other instruments of national power to maintain or reestablish a safe and secure \nenvironment, restore essential government services, and provide emergency infrastructure reconstruction \nChapter 1 \n1-4  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016and humanitarian relief ( ADP  3-07). The SBCT Infantry rifle company supports stability tasks by \nperforming company level missions, tasks, and activities that support a safe and secure environment, \nprovide essential governmental services, emergency infrastructure reconstruction, and humanitarian relief. \nDefense Support of Civil Authorities \n1-20. Defense support of civil authority is the Department of Defense’s (DOD) support to U.S. civil \nauthorities for domestic emergencies, and for designated law enforcement and other activities. Forces \nconduct defense support of civil authority tasks only within the U.S. to protect her possessions and \nterritories. U.S. Army forces conduct defense support of civil authority when the size and scope of events \nexceed the capabilities or capacities of domestic civilian agencies. Army defense support of civil authority \nincludes four primary tasks (refer to ADRP 3-28): \nProvide support for domestic disaster.\nProvide support for domestic chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield\nexplosive (CBRNE) incidents.\nProvide support for domestic civilian law enforcement agencies.\nProvide other designated support.\n1-21. Stryker units are capable to support defense support of civil authority due to their mobility and \nformation specifications. They provide the ability to carry the support needed for all tasks for its personnel \nand partnered forces for sustained periods of time. It can operate in the same areas as many of the vehicles \nthe civil authority operate in. \nCORE COMPETENCIES \n1-22. Although distinct by definition, combined arms maneuver and wide area security are inseparable and \nsimultaneous. Combined arms maneuver and wide area security provide the Army a focus for decisive \naction and as a construct for understanding how Army forces use combined arms to achieve success in this \ncontest of wills. As core competencies, combined arms maneuver and wide area security uniquely define \nwhat the Army provides to the joint force commander (JFC). Additionally, the Army is organized and \nequipped to support the JFC through combined arms to cover vast distances for extended periods. The \nArmy works to integrate all available instruments to unified action partners to achieve the desired outcome \n(ADRP 3-0). \nCOMBINED ARMS MANEUVER  \n1-23. Combined arms maneuver is the application of the elements of combat power in unified action to \ndefeat enemy ground forces; to seize, occupy, and defend land areas; and to achieve physical, temporal, and \npsychological advantages over the enemy to seize and exploit the initiative (ADRP 3-0).  \n1-24. Combined arms maneuver for an SBCT Infantry rifle company is more than just the combined arms \nmaneuverability from within the company, battalion, or the SBCT itself. It is using all available asset s \npossible to keep the enemy off balance and to have a better situational understanding of your operational \nenvironment (OE). Because of the multiple assets available with in the company itself, for example, snipers, \nmortars, Infantry, and MGS vehicles , and throughout the SBCT, the SBCT Infantry rifle company has the \nability to task-organize for combined arms maneuver. Some of these assets could come from other units \ninside and outside of the SBCT, sister services, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), or host-nation \nsecurity forces (HNSF) when available. \nWIDE AREA SECURITY  \n1-25. Wide area security  is the application of the elements of combat power in unified action to protect \npopulations, forces, infrastructure, and activities; to deny the enemy positions of advantage; and to \nconsolidate gains in order to retain the initiative (ADRP 3-0). Reconnaissance and security tasks provide a \nfoundation to support successful wide area security. This allows the company commander to understand the \noperational environment and to protect the local population and the unit. As with combined arms maneuver, \nsuccessful wide area security involves all available assets from inside and outside of the SBCT Infantry \nrifle company. \nOrganization and Capabilities \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 1-5 COMBAT POWER \n1-26. Combat power  is the total means of destructive, constructive, and information capabilities that a \nmilitary unit or formation can apply at a given time (ADP 3-0). SBCT Infantry rifle companies generate \ncombat power by converting potential into effective action. Infantry company commanders conceptualize \ntheir capabilities in terms of combat power. Combat power has eight elements, the six warfighting \nfunctions —mission command, movement and maneuver, intelligence, fires, sustainment, and protection —\nplus leadership, and information. Commanders apply the warfighting functions using leadership and \ninformation throughout to multiply the effects of combat power.  \n1-27. SBCT Infantry rifle company commanders understand, visualize, describe, direct, and lead \noperations and training in terms of the warfighting functions. Decisive, shaping, and sustaining operations \ncombine all the warfighting functions to generate combat power. No warfighting function is a stand-alone \nentity or capability. (Refer to ADRP 3-0 for more information.) \nLEADERSHIP \n1-28. Leadership  is the process of influencing people by providing purpose, direction, and motivation, to \naccomplish the mission and improve the organization ( ADP  6-22). Leaders, by virtue of their assumed role \nor assigned responsibility, inspire and influence people to accomplish the mission. Leaders motivate \nSoldiers to pursue actions, reemphasize thinking, and shape decisions for the greater good of the \norganization. They instill in Soldiers the will to win. \n1-29. Leadership within the SBCT Infantry rifle company requires bold, aggressive, resourceful, and \nadaptive initiatives that force Soldiers to take actions that support their leaders’ intent. Leaders should be \nwilling to accept prudent risks to accomplish the mission. The SBCT Infantry rifle company challenges \nleaders to think quickly and act decisively to seize the initiative from the enemy. The techniques used \nwithin the SBCT differ from Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) and Infantry brigade combat team \n(IBCT) in that Infantry normally operate in front of their Stryker vehicle during maneuver requiring \nleadership to focus on synchronization of their efforts. \nINFORMATION \n1-30. Information that is analyzed and developed into actionable intelligence is a powerful tool in the \noperational environment. In modern conflict, information and analyzing that information has become \nnearly as important as lethal action when determining success or failure of operations at all levels. Every \nengagement or major operation requires supporting information operations to ensure successful mission \naccomplishment. Commanders use analyzed information to understand, visualize, describe, and direct the \nwarfighting functions.  \n1-31. Soldiers use information to persuade, inform, and influence target audiences. Information helps \nshape the perceptions of the civilian population. Commanders conduct reconnaissance to collect \ninformation in order to make timely decisions to shape the operational environment. Enemy forces, neutral, \nand friendly populations use information to convey their message. Information can be critical in decisive \naction and is particularly critical in stability tasks where popular support is a major factor in success or \nfailure. \n1-32. Information systems provide leaders with the information they need to enhance and reemphasize the \nwarfighting functions. Relevant information enables the SBCT Infantry company commander to make \ninformed decisions on how to apply combat power. The Force XXI battle command-brigade and below \n(FBCB2) computer-displayed common operational picture (COP) is a good example. It can provide SBCT \nInfantry company commanders with improved situational awareness (SA) by merging information into \ndisplays that Infantry Soldiers can understand at a glance. COPs do not always include terrain based \nsystems such as FBCB2 and command post of the future (CPOF). They can also contain data bases that \ndescribe the civil considerations as well in such systems as tactical ground reporting (TIGR) net and \nBiometrics Automated Toolset System/Handheld Interagency Identity Detection Equipment \n(BATS/HIIDE) systems. Accurate intelligence disseminated quickly through information systems enables \nthe SBCT Infantry rifle company to maneuver to positions of tactical advantage while massing the effects \nat the decisive place and time. \nChapter 1 \n1-6  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016WARFIGHTING FUNCTIONS \n1-33. A warfighting function  is a group of tasks and systems (people, organizations, information, and \nprocesses) united by a common purpose that commanders use to accomplish missions and training \nobjectives (ADRP 3-0). All warfighting functions possess scalable capabilities to mass lethal and nonlethal \neffects. No warfighting function is exclusively decisive, shaping, or sustaining, but may contain elements \nof more than one type of operation. (Refer to ADRP 3-0 for more information.) Commanders use the \nfollowing warfighting functions to help them exercise mission command. \nMISSION COMMAND  \n1-34. The mission command warfighting function  is the related tasks and systems that develop and \nintegrate those activities enabling a commander to balance the art of command and the science of control in \norder to integrate the other warfighting functions (ADRP 3-0). Mission command uses mission orders to \nensure the use of disciplined initiative within the commander's intent, enabling agile and adaptive \ncommanders, leaders, and organizations.  \n1-35. In the SBCT Infantry rifle company, the company commander is the central figure in mission \ncommand. The commander is essential to integrating the capabilities of the warfighting functions to \naccomplish the mission. Mission command invokes the greatest possible freedom of action to subordinates, \nfacilitating their abilities to develop the situation, adapt, and act decisively through disciplined initiative \nwithin the commander’s intent. It focuses on empowering subordinate leaders and sharing information to \nfacilitate decentralized execution. (Refer to Section III of this chapter for more information.) \n1-36. The SBCT Infantry company commander is provided with a full suite of networked enabled, mission \ncommand capabilities that allow them to gain and maintain situational awareness of friendly units and \nenemy activity, in near-real time, and allows them to synchronize assets and warfighting functions at their \nechelon of command. Additionally, the SBCT Infantry company commander has mission command access \nto secure elements of information from the Brigade through the squad level, allowing for situational \nawareness of their organic assets, adjacent units, and echelons above company level. This networked-\nenabled Mission Command capability also enables the commander with a reach-back capability for \nproducts, preformatted reports, information, and staff analysis support from echelons above the company \nlevel. The commander also has the capability to establish a static, command post (CP) and perform mission \ncommand and COIST activities. \nMOVEMENT AND MANEUVER  \n1-37. The movement and maneuver warfighting function  is the related tasks and systems that move and \nemploy forces to achieve a position of relative advantage over the enemy and other threats (ADRP 3-0). \nThe company commander concentrates combat power using movement and maneuver to achieve surprise, \nshock, momentum, and dominance. Effective maneuver for SBCT units requires close coordination with \nfires and synchronization with Infantry operating in front of their Stryker vehicles. \nINTELLIGENCE  \n1-38. The intelligence warfighting function  is the related tasks and systems that facilitate understanding the \nenemy, terrain, and civil considerations (ADRP 3-0). These tasks are interrelated, require the participation \nof the command and staff, and are often conducted simultaneously. The intelligence warfighting function \ntasks facilitate the commander’s visualization and understanding of the threat and other relevant aspects of \nthe operational environment. The COIST assists the commander in the conduct of mission analysis and \nwith analysis of information. Combat information is disseminated rapidly throughout the SBCT often \nlaterally and vertically. \nFIRES \n1-39. The fires warfighting function comprises tasks and systems that provide collective and coordinated \nuse of Army indirect fires and joint fires through the targeting process. It includes tasks that integrate and \nsynchronize the effects of these types of fires with the other warfighting functions (see ADP  3-0). The \nSBCT Infantry rifle company leadership integrates direct and indirect fires in conjunction with one another \nfrom varying echelons of direct and indirect fire systems from organic, attached, and augmented assets. \nOrganization and Capabilities \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 1-7 SUSTAINMENT  \n1-40. The sustainment warfighting function  is the related tasks and systems that provide support and \nservices to ensure freedom of action, extend operational reach, and prolong endurance (ADP 3-0) . The \nsustainment warfighting function includes the following tasks:  \nConduct logistics.\nProvide personnel services.\nProvide health service support.\n1-41. SBCT Infantry rifle company conducts sustainment in coordination with the SBCT Infantry battalion \nand logistical elements from the brigade support battalion (BSB) often directly to ensure that sustainment \nneeds are met. \nPROTECTION  \n1-42. The protection warfighting functi on is the related tasks and systems that preserve the force so the \ncommander can apply maximum combat power to accomplish the mission (ADRP 3-0). Preserving the \nforce includes protecting personnel (combatant and noncombatant), physical assets, and information of the \nUnited States and multinational partners.  \nSECTION II – ORGANIZATION \n1-43. SBCT Infantry rifle companies are optimized to conduct decisive action. The SBCT rifle company’s \ncombat power resides mostly with in its three rifle platoons —each with three Infantry rifle squads, a \nweapons squad, and four Stryker Infantry carrier vehicles. SBCT Infantry rifle companies deploy \nworldwide to conduct unified land operations. \nORGANIZATION  \n1-44. The SBCT Infantry rifle company, figure 1-1, can operate independently or as a combined arms force \nbased upon mission variables. Its effectiveness is increased through the synergy of combined arms to \ninclude tanks, field artillery, aviation, intelligence, engineers, and other support elements. Effective \napplication of the SBCT Infantry rifle company as a combined arms force can capitalize on the strengths of \nthe company’s elements while minimizing their respective limitations.  \n1-45. SBCT Infantry units can operate effectively in all terrain and weather conditions. They might be the \ndominant arm in operations because of their rapid strategic deployment and mobility capability. In such \ncases, they can gain the initiative early, seize and hold ground, and mass fires to stop the enemy. Infantry \nunits are particularly effective in the urban environment, where they can maneuver rapidly in close contact \nto positions of tactical advantage against enemy positions. \n1-46. The missions, types, equipment, capabilities, limitations, and organization of Infantry units are the \nfundamental considerations for employing SBCT Infantry rifle companies. These considerations are further \neffected by the unit's training program, leadership, morale, personnel strengths, and other factors. These \nother factors constantly change based on the current situation. \nChapter 1 \n1-8  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016\nLegend: ATGM = antitank guided missile, cal = caliber, Intel = intelligence, FSV= fire support vehicle, mg = \nmachine gun, mm = millimeter. \nFigure 1-1. SBCT Infantry rifle company \n1-47. The SBCT Infantry rifle company has the ability to task-organize within itself to meet specific \nmissions based on METT-TC. It can attach a sniper team, fire support vehicle (FSV), or a MGS to Infantry \nplatoons. \nSBCT Infantry Rifle Company Within the SBCT Infantry Battalion \n1-48. The SBCT Infantry rifle company within the SBCT Infantry battalions can deploy rapidly and be \nsustained by a minimal support structure. The company's composition and training uniquely equip it to \nconduct its mission against conventional and unconventional enemy forces in all types of terrain and \nclimate conditions. The company can support offensive, defensive, and stability or defense support of civil \nauthority tasks semi-independently or as a part of a larger force. It can be task-organized as part of an \nInfantry battalion, a combined arms battalion (CAB), an IBCT, an ABCT, or a support battalion or brigade. \n(See chapter 8 for a discussion of sustainment techniques associated with a Stryker company task-\norganized to these other types of units.) \nCapabilities and Limitations \n1-49. The SBCT combines the tactical mobility aspect of mechanized units while emphasizing and \nexploiting where the Infantry fight occurs. The following list highlights the capabilities and limitations of \nthe SBCT Infantry rifle company. \n1-50. Capabilities — \nIncreased combat power from a standard Infantry company with the addition of a fourth\nplatoon (mobile gun system platoon).\nIncreased tactical mobility for Infantry.\nCarries and employs assortment of weapons to the fight with a “mobile arms room” concept.\nEquipped with organic 120-mm and 60-mm mortars.\nAuthorized organic Sniper team.\nSelf-sustained for 72 hours or mission dependent fuel consumption rates.\nOrganization and Capabilities \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 1-9 Conduct offensive, defensive, and stability tasks in all types of environments.\nSeize, secure, occupy, and retain terrain.\nDestroy, neutralize, suppress, interdict, disrupt, block, canalize, and fix enemy forces.\nBreach enemy obstacles.\nCan conduct feints and demonstrations to deceive the enemy.\nReconnoiters, denies, bypasses, clears, contains, and isolates. (These tasks might be oriented\non both terrain and enemy.)\nOperates in conjunction with mounted or special operations forces.\n1-51. Limitations — \nVulnerable to indirect fires while dismounted.\nReduced company logistical systems.\nHas no organic maintenance section.\nUnable to conduct forced entry by air; requires preoperational staging point.\nVulnerable to enemy armor, artillery, and air assets when employed in open terrain.\nVulnerable to enemy chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) attacks with\nlimited decontamination capability.\nSBCT Infantry Rifle Platoon \n1-52. The Stryker Infantry rifle platoon is a versatile force that can fight in unison with a mounted force \nsupporting a dismounted force or as a purely dismounted force. The Stryker Infantry carrier vehicle (ICV) \nis a platform that is designed to provide protection and mobility to the Infantry element. It facilitates the \nInfantry to seize the initiative by deploying to positions of tactical advantage. The Stryker vehicle is not a \nfighting vehicle and lacks the protection and lethality to initiate contact and destroy enemy fighting \nplatforms. The Infantry platoon has one officer and 44 enlisted personnel in a platoon headquarters, three \nStryker Infantry weapons squads, and one Stryker Infantry weapons squad. Additionally the platoon is \naugmented with an FO and a medic as habitual attachments.  \n1-53. The Stryker Infantry rifle platoons can fight as in multiple mutually supporting maneuver elements to \ninclude: \nSquad leader controls two Infantry fire teams and Stryker ICV.\nThe Squad leader fights the Infantry squad while the ICVs move in vehicle Sections under a\nsection leader.\nThe platoon fights infantry squads with ICVs in support .\nThe platoon fights infantry squads and ICVs as separate formations and conduct a linkup .\n1-54. The Stryker Infantry rifle platoon relies on its mission command and intent based orders to \naccomplish the mission. The platoon facilitates lower level leadership to seize the initiative through intent \nbased orders with higher level leadership synchronizing their actions.  \nMGS Platoon \n1-55. The MGS platoon provides direct supporting fires to Infantry squads during the assault. Its function \nis to destroy or suppress hardened enemy bunkers, machine gun positions, and sniper positions. It also \ncreates Infantry breach points in urban, restricted, and open rolling terrain. The MGS 105 mm main gun \nprovides the platoon with limited anti-armor, self-defense capabilities. The MGS is not a tank, however, \nand should not be employed in the same manner as a tank; nor should the MGS platoon be employed in the \nsame manner as a tank platoon. \n1-56. The MGS offers an array of capabilities on the modern battlefield. It can move rapidly in a variety of \nterrain conditions, negotiating soft ground, shallow trenches, small trees, and limited obstacles. The \nfollowing factors, in combination, produce the shock effect that allows the MGS to close with and destroy \nthe enemy in most weather and light conditions: \nCross-country mobility.\nEnhanced target acquisition.\nChapter 1 \n1-10  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016Lethal firepower.\nMedium-strength armor protection.\n1-57. The MGS is limited when it operates in restricted terrain such as built-up areas or dense woods. The \nreduction of visibility limits the crew ’s situational awareness and creates vulnerability to dismounted \nenemy attacks. In such situations, the MGS usually requires that mounted or Infantrymen provide flank and \noverwatch security to maintain its maneuverability and observation advantage  \n1-58. The MGS platoon provides four different ways to operate within the SBCT Infantry rifle company \nbased on a commander’s operational considerations. (Refer to ATP 3 -20.16 for more information.) They \nare as follows:  \nIndividual MGS vehicles under Infantry platoon control. In this technique, each MGS vehicle\nis task-organized to an Infantry platoon. The purpose of this type of task organization is to\nprovide all the Infantry platoons with increased direct fire for suppression and breaching,\nspecifically in urban areas.\nMGS platoon retained under company control. In this technique, the MGS platoon is\nresponsible for maneuvering the MGS vehicles according to the company commander’s intent.\nMGS platoon minus (-) under company control and an MGS vehicle under Infantry platoon\ncontrol. In this technique, the MGS platoon detaches one vehicle to the control of an Infantry\nplatoon. The selected maneuver Infantry platoon has an MGS vehicle available to support the\nclose fight, and the company commander has an MGS platoon (-) to deploy at the critical place\nand time of his choosing.\nMortar Section \n1-59. Mortars sections are organic to all SBCT Infantry rifle companies. The mission of mortars is to \nprovide immediate and close supporting fires to the maneuver forces in contact. The primary role of the \ncompany mortar section is to provide immediate, responsive indirect fires in support of maneuver elements . \nThe mortar section is comprised of the fire direction center (FDC), and two mortar squads. The FDC \ncontrols and directs mortar fires. SBCT Infantry rifle company mortar squads are each equipped with \nmounted 120-mm and dismounted 60-mm mortars. (Refer to Army tactics, techniques, and procedures \n(ATTP) 3-21.90 for more information about mortars.) \nSniper Team \n1-60. Sniper tasks apply to most operations conducted by the SBCT Infantry rifle company. The following \ndiscussion is not inclusive and each unit sniper employment officer should develop the sniper tasks based \non the unit commander’s intent and operational requirements.  \nProvide Long-Range Precision Fire \n1-61. The sniper supports combat operations by delivering long-range precision fire on key selected targets \nand targets of oppo rtunity. Some specific missions include―  \nAccurate fire.\nCommand posts and key enemy leaders.\nCrew-served weapons and crews.\nBunkers and embrasures.\nKey enemy equipment.\nSelected targets just prior to an attack.\nSecurity or cover for.\nFriendly engineers, demolition guards, and supply columns.\nObstacles, key terrain and defiles.\nCounterattack routes.\nFlanks.\nCountersnip er missions.\nAmbushes or harassment of withdrawing enemy.\nOrganization and Capabilities \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 1-11 Covering fire for observation posts or fire positions.\nObservation and control of indirect fire onto enemy positions.\nCollect and Report Battlefield Information \n1-62. The sniper team’s alternate mission is always reconnaissance conducted by static surveillance. They \nuse their advanced optics to collect and report detailed battlefield information from concealed positions. \nATP 3-20.98 provides more information on the fundamentals of reconnaissance and battlefield information \ncollection and reporting. \nConsiderations \n1-63. When the commander receives a mission, his decision to employ sniper teams depends on his \nanalysis of METT-TC. The sniper employment officer assists the commander in determining exact sniper \nmissions and the number of teams to deploy. The commander also considers — \nRules of engagement.\nCollateral damage.\nPotential mines and unexploded ordinance.\nShoot-on -command capability.\nReconnaissance and security missions.\nSupport by the quick reaction forces.\nSustainment.\nCommunication.\nHeadquarters Section \n1-64. The SBCT Infantry rifle company is not resourced to operate a functional CP according to the \nmodified table of organization and equipment (MTOE). However, establishing a CP may have a positive \nimpact on the SBCT Infantry rifle company’s day -to-day performance particularly during sustained \noperations.  \n1-65. The Soldiers manning the SBCT Infantry rifle company CP assist the commander and his \nsubordinate leaders to prepare for missions by — \nProvides a centralized point for information collection and dissemination, coordination, time\nmanagement, and tracking the status of subordinate elements.\nMaintains a COP to higher and adjacent units.\nProvides communications with higher, lower, adjacent, and supporting units.\nAssists the commander in planning, coordinating, and issuing company operations orders\n(OPORD).\nResourcing the Command Post \n1-66. The most critical decision in developing a company CP is committing resources. Company \ncommanders should task organize for a command post based on the operating environment (offense, \ndefense, stability). Ideally, intelligence personnel are assigned to perform company-level intelligence tasks; \nhowever if not assigned, those duties and functions can be performed by other personnel. The level of \ndedicated resources (mainly personnel) to the company CP has a direct correlation to the effectiveness of \nthe fusion between missions and locally developed intelligence. \n1-67. There are several options for manning an SBCT Infantry rifle company CP. The basic minimum \nmanning requirement is for two noncommissioned officers (NCOs) to serve as noncommissioned officers \nin charge (NCOICs) with two radio/ telephone operators (RTOs). One NCO is in charge of each shift. A \nthird shift is ideal for longer continuous operations if it can be manned with personnel. Shifts can vary \nbetween times of starts and shift changes. Leaders should pay attention to circadian battle rhythm because \nsplitting shifts based on hours of sunlight and night time can have psychological effects on Soldiers. These \nNCOs perform their duties with little or no supervision.  \nChapter 1 \n1-12  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 20161-68. Members of the headquarters section can man needed positions in the CP, such as the RTO. These \nmembers include the company command group drivers. There should be two RTOs. One RTO supports \neach shift. The RTO assists the NCOIC as needed to accomplish the mission. \nFunctions \n1-69. The company CP assists the commander in reducing the number of items he personally tracks and \nreports. This frees him to conduct troop leading procedures (TLP) during the preparation phase. Examples \nof CP operations include the following: \nRecord incoming and outgoing information such as status reports, warning orders\n(WARNORDs), OPORDs, and fragmentary orders (FRAGORDs).\nContinuously refine the situational template using the latest intelligence and distribute the\nupdated situational template to all company elements.\nPost current guidance, timelines, and overlays.\nPass required reports to the battalion.\nTrack unit combat preparations and logistical status.\nConduct required coordination with adjacent and flank units.\nFacilitate bottom-up refinement of planning and preparation.\nBattle tracking.\nCPs act as a communications retransmitting site to higher headquarters, when necessary.\n1-70. The CP may be used as the point of contact for attached or operational control (OPCON) units. \nSoldiers manning the CP further assist the commander in his TLPs by supervising and enforcing the \ntimeline, reproducing overlays, and constructing sand tables for company and platoon rehearsals. The \ncompany CP is intended as an information management center during the planning and preparation phase \nof a mission and battle tracking during mission execution. \nCompany Intelligence Support Team (COIST) \n1-71. Many company commanders perform basic intelligence tasks that include refining collection \ncapabilities, analyzing ongoing metrics in the area of operations (AO), and performing basic intelligence \nsupport to targeting. To accomplish these tasks, company commanders organize small intelligence support \nteams from within their units that provide meaningful intelligence. These COISTs do this by analyzing and \nreporting information collected by the company while receiving, parsing, and reporting intelligence \ncollected by both adjacent and higher units.  \nDefinition and Function \n1-72. A company intelligence support team  is an organization formed by the company commander to \nperform tasks that facilitate his understanding and knowledge of the AO. COISTs assist a company by — \nDeveloping and maintaining situational understanding and knowledge of the relevant aspects\nof the AO.\nDeveloping information requirements.\nFacilitating flow of information to and from company elements and the battalion S-2.\nTurning information into intelligence.\n1-73. Ideally, companies organize COISTs as a part of the predeployment process. The COIST should \nidentify requirements based on mission variables (METT-TC) prior to arriving in the AO and analysis \nshould include activities within the unit’s area of interest. The function of the COIST is to describe the \neffects of the weather, enemy, terrain, and local population upon friendly operations in order to reduce the \ncommander’s uncertainty and aid in decisi on making. This function is accomplished by gleaning \nintelligence from the information gathered, recommending a course of action to the commander, and \ndisseminating any intelligence to members of the company and the higher and lateral units. The COIST \nprovides platoons with information and current intelligence concerning the company operations. The \nbattalion intelligence cell provides an initial analysis of the AO to the company; COISTs refine these \nproducts based on knowledge gained by Soldiers performing missions in the company AO. \nOrganization and Capabilities \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 1-13 Organization \n1-74. Ideally, a COIST should consist of enough individuals to enable continuous operations and provide \nthe depth required by the team to integrate with operations personnel and complete multiple COIST tasks. \n1-75. The commander identifies COIST personnel as soon as possible in the Army force generation \n(ARFORGEN) cycle. These individuals attend home station and mobile training team training, execute \nCOIST duties during combat training center rotations, and remain in the COIST throughout the \ndeployment. The early identification, training, and stability of COIST personnel ensure optimum \nperformance.  \nGeneral Requirements \n1-76. Commanders selects personnel that meet these basic requirement and attributes: \nAuthorized access to Secret information.\nAbility to organize information.\nAbility to think, speak, and write clearly.\nKnowledgeable of or able to learn computer skills and common office software applications.\nIntelligence Oversight \n1-77. COIST members are required to follow all intelligence oversight regulations, primarily AR 381-10. It \nspecifies that Army personnel cannot perform intelligence collection on U.S. persons. Therefore, in \ncompliance with AR 381-10, the COIST may not collect intelligence on any U.S. person. Members should \nreceive annual intelligence oversight training to ensure they understand the regulation and are compliant. \nDuty Positions \n1-78. Members of a COIST may include a leader, team members, and intelligence analyst. \nLeader \n1-79. The leader is responsible for the COIST. The officer in charge (OIC) — \nTasks COIST members appropriately and prioritizes their work.\nIs responsible for communicating with the battalion to verify what intelligence and collection\nassets are available to the company.\nEnsures intelligence communications flow in both directions.\nPerforming the duties of COIST Soldiers, if necessary.\nProviding guidance to subordinate Soldiers.\nSupervising ongoing intelligence support in the company.\n1-80. Specific products sent and received from the battalion should be coordinated in the battalion COIST \nSOPs.  \nTeam Members \n1-81. Soldiers in COIST complete most of the COIST duties. Although they may not have attended the all-\nsource intelligence analyst training at the Intelligence Center of Excellence, analysts are trained to \naccomplish analyst functions. Team members are responsible for reading, interpreting, researching, and \nanalyzing all available information on the company AO or other information that may affect company \noperations. COIST.  \n1-82. The primary duties of the team members include — \nReceiving and processing incoming reports and messages.\nAssisting in determining the significance and reliability of incoming information.\nMaking mission recommendations to the company commander.\nAssisting in integrating incoming information with current intelligenc e.\nPreparing and maintaining the situation map.\nChapter 1 \n1-14  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016Assisting in identifying information gaps.\nAssisting in preparing and submitting requests for information (RFIs) to adjacent and higher\nunits.\nAssembling and proofreading reports and consolidating them into usable products.\nPreparing intelligence preparation of the battlefield (IPB) products.\nAssisting in preparing reports on captured enemy materiel.\nAssisting in target development.\nDrafting periodic and special reports and briefings.\nSensitizing patrols to information collection requirements.\nBriefing and debriefing patrols.\nPreparing and providing mission briefs and debriefs.\nCompany IntelligenceAnalyst \n1-83. The company intelligence analyst (MOS 35F) is assigned to the battalion intelligence cell. Once the \nCOIST is formed, the company intelligence analyst joins the company. The company intelligence analyst \ngenerally supports the company commander by — \nAdvising the commander on intelligence related matters.\nEstablishing and maintaining systematic, cross-referenced intelligence records and files.\nRefining battalion IPB products for company/troop/battery planning.\nSupporting commander’s situational understanding of the operational environment.\nAssisting in the analysis and evaluation of intelligence holdings to determine changes in enemy\ncapabilities, vulnerabilities, and probable courses of action (COAs).\nAssisting in preparing threat characteristics and estimates of the enemy organization’s\nstrengths, capabilities, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).\nRecommending company/troop/battery information requirements and specific information\nrequirements to the commander.\nSupporting target development.\nCompany Intelligence Analyst Tasks \n1-84. The company intelligence analyst task list should be simple and allow the team to operate effectively \nwhile following the intelligence process described in ADRP 2-0. These individual intelligence analyst tasks \nare also performed by members of the COIST when formed by the company commander. \nFacilitate Company Commanders Situational Understanding and Visualization \n1-85. The analyst supports company situation development by collecting and processing information \ncollected from missions. The intelligence analyst is responsible for logging and plotting significant \nactivities (SIGACTs) and initial reports that may become official SIGACTs. COISTs may also present \npatrol prebriefs and debriefs while performing initial analysis on information to develop intelligence. The \nanalyst focuses on collecting the information, initial analysis for the company-specific AO, transmitting the \nanalysis to the battalion, and updating company products. The subordinate tasks are — \nAssist in developing company requirements —translates the battalion information collection\ntasks into company requirement recommendations to the commander. Company requirements\nanswer general questions that allow commanders to successfully accomplish their missions.\nPerform IPB for company operations —receives IPB products from the battalion and refines the\nproducts to satisfy company requirements. Company-level IPB products are synchronized with\nhigher and lateral echelons to improve the overall intelligence picture.\nSubmit request for information collection —forwards company requirements to the battalion to\nsatisfy the commander’s information requirements that can’t be answered through company\nlevel operations.\nSupport the commander’s TLP—produce products and materials that support the commander’s\nability to issue the operations order and conduct a rehearsal.\nOrganization and Capabilities \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 1-15 Evaluate and Perform Analysis \n1-86. The intelligence analyst performs basic analysis by organizing information and using analytical tools \nto process information. This analysis requires organization of information into categories and the \nidentification of patterns or relationships among the categories. The analyst takes products and reports from \nthe battalion and modifies these to support company operations. The subordinate tasks are — \nIntegrate and refine products and information —refines and modifies higher headquarters\nproducts, reports, and graphics to support the company’s operations.\nConduct pattern and event analysis —analyze significant activities to determine changes in\nenemy capabilities, vulnerabilities, and probable COAs\nInput threat portion of the COP —ensure relevant information concerning the threat and key\ncivil considerations are included in the COP.\nUpdate the commander —ensures the commander is updated on the enemy situation and key\ncivil considerations either via radio or in person briefing.\nManage Information and Intelligence \n1-87.

The intelligence analyst also provides information and refined intelligence that facilitates the \ncompany’s ability to conduct site exploitation, targeting, bilateral/key leader engagement and assists with \ndetainee operations. The subordinate tasks are — \nSupport site exploitation —provides information and intelligence that: predicts existence of\nitems of intelligence value at the site; identifies individuals who may be at the site; prepares a\nline of tactical questioning for detainees at the site; and provides the instructions for handling\ncaptured materials, documents, and equipment.\nSupport targeting —provides focused intelligence that supports target development, target\nsupport meetings, enhances the company detection and assessment capability, and that\nidentifies high-value individuals or organizations with the company’s area of operation.\nSupport bilateral and key leader engagement —maintains all information on community\nleaders, including nonlethal target packages. This information is organized by position, family,\npersonal traits, links to other individuals, and historical activities of community individuals\nAssist with detainee operations —ensures that departing patrols have blank detainee packets\nand the knowledge to complete the forms properly; maintains detainee packets and tracks the\ncurrent location and status of the company’s detainees; and ensures company’s detainees are\nenrolled in the appropriate biometrics data files/databases.\nHABITUAL ATTACHMENTS  \n1-89. The fire support team and combat medics are normally attached whenever the company deploys. \nChapter 1 \n1-16  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  Company and Platoon Fire Support Team \n1-90. A FIST from the battalion fire support platoon may be attached or placed OPCON to the company. \nThe FIST headquarters personnel authorized for the SBCT Infantry rifle company include an FSO, a fire \nsupport sergeant, a fire support specialist, an RTO, three FOs, and three RTOs according to company.  \nCompany and Platoon Medics \n1-91. The basis of allocation for company-level medical support is one senior combat medic for a company \nand one combat medic for a maneuver platoon. This allocation is designed to place medical treatment assets \nas close to the point of injury as is possible. \n1-92. The company’s emergency care sergeant is usually located with the company trains; and platoon \nmedics are usually located with the platoon headquarters element. The emergency care sergeant cares for \nthe sick, injured, or wounded company personnel. Tactical combat casualty care is provided in the \noperational environment by providing care in three stages: care under fire, tactical field care, and tactical \nevacuation under the training and supervision of the battalion surgeon. Emergency medical treatment \n(EMT) procedures performed by the senior combat medic include opening an airway, starting intravenous \nfluids, controlling hemorrhage, preventing or treating for shock, splinting fractures or suspected fractures, \nand providing relief for pain. The emergency care sergeant performs EMT under the supervision of the \nbattalion sur geon or physician’s assistant. The emergency care sergeant is responsible for—  \nOverseeing and providing guidance to each platoon medic, as required.\nTraining personnel to evaluate injured, wounded, or ill friendly and enemy personnel for\npriority of treatment as they arrive at the company casualty collection point (CCP).\nOverseeing sick call screening for the company.\nRequesting and coordinating the evacuation of sick, injured, or wounded personnel under the\ndirection of the company 1SG (first sergeant).\nAssisting in first aid training of the company personnel, and enhanced first aid procedures of\ncombat lifesavers.\nRecommending locations for company CCPs.\nProviding guidance to the company’s combat lifesavers.\nMonitoring the tactical situation, anticipating and coordinating health services support (HSS)\nrequirements, and Class VIII resupply, as needed.\nAdvising the company commander and 1SG on mass casualty operations.\nAdvising the company commander and 1SG on unit field sanitation issues.\nKeeping the 1SG informed of the status of casualties and coordinating with him for additional\nsustainment requirements.\nEmploying treatment vehicles with two medical equipment sets (MES) and tactical combat\nmedical care (TCMC) assemblages.\nAssist the 1SG in maintaining hygiene of the unit with force health protection (FHP) oversight\nand procedures.\nSECTION III – DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES \n1-93. This section describes the duties and responsibilities of key personnel and habitual attachments in the \nSBCT Infantry rifle company. \nCOMMANDER  \n1-94. The commander leads by personal example and is responsible for everything the SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany does, or fails to do, in executing its assigned missions. The commander’s responsibilities include, \nbut are not limited to leadership, training, tactical employment, and sustainment activities of his company. \nThese duties require the commander to understand the capabilities of the company’s Soldiers and \nequipment, and to understand how to employ them to the best tactical advantage. At the same time, the \ncommander is well versed in threat organizations, doctrine, and equipment.  \nOrganization and Capabilities \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 1-17 1-95. Using this knowledge, the commander prepares his unit for missions. Ultimately, he knows how to \nexercise the art and science of mission command effectively and decisively.

Offensive tasks lets the commander seize the initiative (choose when \nand where to fight), retain the initiative, and effectively exploit his company's \nstrengths. The commander may conduct offensive tasks to deprive the enemy of \nresources, seize decisive terrain, deceive or divert the enemy, collect information, or \nfix an enemy in position. This chapter covers basics of the offense, common \noffensive planning considerations, movement to contact, attack, and transitions. \nSECTION I – BASICS OF THE OFFENSE \n2-1. The basics of the offense establish a foundation for further discussion of how the SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany conducts offensive tasks. \nCHARACTERISTICS OF THE OFFENSE \n2-2. The main feature of offensive tasks is taking and maintaining the initiative. The aim of the \ncommander in the offense is to defeat the threat. Audacity, concentration, surprise, and tempo characterize \nthe conduct of offensive tasks and are components of initiative. Initiative —within the higher commander’s \nintent, combined with maneuver and fires, makes possible the conduct of decisive offensive tasks. (Refer to \nADP  3-90 for more information.) \nSURPRISE \n2-3. Commanders achieve surprise by striking the enemy at a time or place, or in a manner, for which he \nis unprepared, by assess ing the enemy commander’s intent and denying that commander the ability to gain \nsituational understanding. The company then capitalizes on information gained through action by \nmaneuvering forces to critical locations on the battlefield to limit the enemy’s  ability to react. \nCONCENTRATION \n2-4. Concentration is the massing of overwhelming effects of the combined arms team to achieve a single \npurpose. The company commander must avoid set patterns or obvious movements that would indicate the \ntiming or direction of the attack. He designates, sustains, and shifts the main effort as necessary. An \nenhanced digital communications and information system found at the company level facilitates the ability \nto concentrate combat power in a synchronized manner against the enemy quickly. \nTEMPO \n2-5. Tempo is a combination of speed and mass that creates pressure on the enemy. Commanders build \nthe appropriate tempo to provide the necessary momentum for attacks to achieve their objectives. \n2-6. Controlling or altering tempo, deliberate or rapid, is necessary to retain the initiative. At the tactical \nlevel, a rapid tempo focuses on key pieces of information, terrain, entails a small number of tasks, and \nallows attackers to quickly penetrate barriers and defenses and destroy enemy forces in depth before they \ncan react.   \nChapter 2 \n2-2  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 20162-7. Commanders adjust the tempo to achieve synchronization. Speed is preferred in order to keep the \nenemy off balance, but establishing the conditions for decisive actions may require the tempo to be slowed \nas the pieces are set in place. Once ready, the tempo is increased, and the action takes place rapidly. \nAUDACITY \n2-8. Audacity is achieved by boldly executing a simple plan of action. Commanders must exercise \naudacity by developing bold, inventive plans that produce decisive results while violently applying combat \npower. Commanders understand when and where to take risks, avoid hesitation when executing their plan \nin order to seize, retain, or exploit the initiative. \nOFFENSIVE TASKS \n2-9. An offensive task is a task conducted to defeat and destroy enemy forces and seize terrain, resources, \nand population centers (ADRP 3-0). The four primary offensive tasks are movement to contact, attack, \nexploitation, and pursuit. The SBCT Infantry rifle company can participate in an exploitation or pursuit as \npart of a larger force by conducting movement to contact or attack as part brigade and higher echelon \nformations. (Refer to FM 3-90-1 for more information.) \nSEQUENCE OF THE OFFENSE \n2-10. This chapter discusses executing movement to contact and attack offensive tasks using the following \nmethodology: \nGain and maintain enemy contact.\nDisrupt the enemy.\nFix the enemy.\nManeuver.\nFollow through.\n2-11. This methodology is for discussion purposes only and is not the only way of conducting these \noffensive tasks. The methodology used to illustrate the execution of offensive tasks actually tends to \noverlap each other during the conduct of offense. Normally the first three are shaping operations, while \nmaneuver is the decisive operation. Follow through is a sequel or a branch to the plan based on the current \nsituation. \nFORMS OF CONTACT  \n2-12. In both offensive and defensive tasks, contact occurs when a member of the SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany encounters a situation that requires a lethal or nonlethal response. These situations may entail one \nor more of the following forms of contact: (Refer to FM 3-20.96 for more information.) \nVisual.\nDirect fire.\nIndirect fire.\nObstacles.\nAerial.\nCBRN.\nElectronic warfare (EW ).\nNonhostile.\nAdversary.\nSupporters.\nNeutrals.\nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-3 Actions on Contact \n2-13. The SBCT Infantry rifle company should execute actions on contact using a logical, well-organized \nprocess of decision making and action that entails the following four steps: (Refer to FM 3-90-1 for more \ninformation.) \nDeploy and report.\nEvaluate and develop the situation and COA .\nChoose a COA.\nExecute the selected COA.\n2-14. This four-step process, with some steps often conducted simultaneously, is not intended to generate a \nrigid, lockstep response to the enemy. Rather, the goal is to provide an orderly framework that enables the \nSBCT Infantry rifle company and its platoons to survive the initial contact, and then apply sound decision \nmaking and timely actions to complete the operation. Ideally, the company sees the enemy (visual contact) \nbefore being seen by the enemy; it then can initiate physical contact on its own terms by executing the \ndesignated COA. \n2-15. Once the lead elements of a force encounter the enemy, they conduct actions on contact. The unit \ntreats obstacles like enemy contact, as it assumes that the obstacles are covered by fire. The unit’s security \nforce gains tactical advantage over an enemy force by using tempo and initiative to conduct actions on \ncontact. Doing so allows the unit to gain and maintain contact without becoming decisively engaged. How \nquickly the unit develops the situation is directly related to its security. This tempo is directly related to the \nunit's use of well-rehearsed SOPs and drills. \n2-16. Commanders understand that properly executed actions on contact require time at both platoon and \ncompany levels. To develop the situation fully, a platoon or company may have to execute flanking \nmovement; conduct reconnaissance; or call for and adjust indirect fires. Each of these activities requires \ntime. The commander balances the time required for subordinate elements to conduct actions on contact \nwith the need of the company or battalion to maintain momentum. \nDeploy and Report \n2-17. Events that occur during initial contact depend on whether the contact is expected or unexpected. The \nfirst step of actions on contact concludes with the unit deployed, the enemy suppressed or destroyed, and \nthe commander sending a contact report to battalion headquarters. The following paragraphs examine some \nvariables the company commander faces in both contact situations. \nExpected Contact \n2-18. If the commander expects contact (based on reports through his own reconnaissance or through other \nmeans), he will already have deployed the company by transitioning to the bounding overwatch movement \ntechnique. If the company is alert to the likely presence of the enemy, it has a better chance of establishing \nfirst visual contact and then physical contact on its own terms. Contact, either visual or physical, usually is \nmade by an overwatching or bounding platoon, which initiates the company’s actions on contact. In a \nworst-case scenario, a previously undetected (but expected) enemy element may engage the platoon. The \nplatoon in contact would conduct a battle drill for its own survival and then initiate actions on contact. \nUnexpected Contact \n2-19. In some cases, the SBCT Infantry rifle company makes unexpected contact with the enemy while \nusing traveling or traveling overwatch. The element in contact or, if necessary, the entire company may \ndeploy using battle drills to survive the initial contact. When making unexpected contact, the platoon in \ncontact immediately sends a contact report. The most efficient way for the battalion S-2 to provide \nsituational understanding and COP to the battalion is through digital reports sent by platoons in contact. \nThe SBCT Infantry rifle company and platoons develop SOPs that harness the capabilities of FBCB2 while \ndestroying the enemy force and protecting the company. \nEvaluate and Develop the Situation \n2-20. The commander evaluates the situation and continues to develop it while the SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany deploys. The commander quickly gathers as much combat information as possible, either visually \nChapter 2 \n2-4  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016or more often, through reports of the platoon(s) in contact. He analyzes the intelligence to determine critical \noperational considerations, to include the following: \nThe size of the enemy element.\nLocation, composition, activity, and orientation of the enemy force.\nThe impact of obstacles and terrain.\nEnemy capabilities.\nProbable enemy intentions.\nHow to gain positional advantage over the enemy.\nThe friendly situation (location, strength, and capabilities).\nPossible friendly COAs to achieve the specified end state.\n2-21. The SBCT Infantry rifle company commander sends a report to battalion once he determines the size \nof the enemy force the company has encountered. However, after evaluating the situation, the commander \nmay discover that he does not have enough intelligence to identify the necessary operational considerations. \nTo make this determination, he further develops the situation according to the battalion commander’s \nintent, using a combination of the following capabilities: \nReconnaissance; employing SBCT Infantry squads, MGS, sniper; and using other optic s.\nManeuver (this includes flanking maneuver to gain additional intelligence by viewing the\nenemy from another perspective).\nIndirect fire.\nReconnaissance by fire.\nUnmanned aircraft system (UAS).\nChoose a Course of Action \n2-22. After developing the situation and determining that he has enough intelligence to make a decision, \nthe company commander selects a COA that meets the requirements of the battalion commander’s intent \nand is within the company’s capabilities.  \nExecute the Selected Course of Action \n2-23. The company transitions to maneuver when executing a COA. It continues to maneuver throughout \nexecution, either as part of a tactical task or to advance while in contact to reach the point in the AO from \nwhich it executes its tactical task. The company can employ a number of tactical tasks as COAs, any of \nwhich may be preceded (or followed) by additional maneuver. Some of these tasks are as follows: \nAttack by fire.\nBreach.\nBypass.\nClear.\nControl.\nDisengagement.\nExfiltrate.\nFollow and assume.\nFollow and support.\nOccupy.\nRetain.\nSecure.\nSeize.\nSupport by fire.\n2-24. More intelligence becomes available to the company commander as execution continues. The \ncommander may have to alter his COA during execution based on the emerging details of the enemy \nsituation. (For example, as the SBCT Infantry rifle company maneuvers to destroy what appears to be an \nInfantry platoon, it discovers two additional platoons in prepared positions.) The commander analyzes and \nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-5 develops the new situation. He selects an alternate COA, such as establishing a support by fire (SBF) \nposition to support another company’s maneuver against the newly discovered enemy force.  \nRecommend a Course of Action to the Higher Commander \n2-25. Once the company commander selects a COA, keeping in mind the commander’s intent, he informs \nthe battalion commander, who has the option of disapproving it based on its impact on the overall mission. \nUnit SOP may provide automatic approval of certain actions to avoid delay. \nFORMS OF MANEUVER \n2-26. The commander selects the form of maneuver based on his analysis of METT-TC . The commander \nthen synchronizes the contributions of all warfighting functions to the selected form of maneuver. An \noperation may contain several forms of off ensive maneuver. (Refer to FM 3-90-1 for more information.) \nT\nhe six forms of maneuver are as follows: \nEnvelopment.\nFlank Attack.\nTurning movement.\nFrontal attack.\nPenetration.\nInfiltration.\nENVELOPMENT  \n2-27. Envelopment is a form of maneuver in which an attacking force seeks to avoid the principal enemy \ndefenses by seizing objectives behind those defenses that allow the targeted enemy force to be destroyed in \ntheir established positions (FM 3-90-1). At the tactical level, envelopments reemphasize on seizing terrain, \ndestroying specific enemy forces, and interdicting enemy withdrawal routes. The commander’s decisive \noperation focuses on attacking an assailable flank. For example, an MGS platoon fixes an enemy element \nto allow a Stryker infantry platoon to maneuver to a position of advantage at the flank or rear of the enemy, \nthus allowing the Infantry to dismount and assault the objective from a position of advantage. It avoids the \nenemy’s strength— his front —where the effects of his fires and obstacles are the greatest. The commander \nconducts an envelopment instead of a penetration or a frontal attack in order to preserve the attacking force \nby potentially having fewer casualties while having the most opportunity to destroy the enemy. \nEnvelopment also produces great psychological shock on the enemy. The attacking force creates an \nassailable flank if none is available. The four varieties of envelopment are single envelopment, double \nenvelopment, encirclement, and vertical envelopment . (See figure 2-1) . \nChapter 2 \n2-6  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016\nLegend:  MGS = mobile gun system \nFigure 2-1. Envelopment \nFLANK ATTACK  \n2-28. A flank attack  is a form of offensive maneuver directed at the flank of an enemy force. A flank is the \nright or left side of a military formation and is not oriented toward the enemy. It is usually not as strong in \nterms of forces or fires as is the front of a military formation. A flank may be created by the attacker \nthrough the use of fires or by a successful penetration. A flanking attack is similar to an envelopment but \ngenerally conducted on a shallower axis. It is designed to defeat the enemy force while minimizing the \neffect of the enemy‘s frontally -oriented combat power.  \n2-29. SBCT Infantry rifle companies conduct flank attacks normally as the decisive operation directed at \nthe flank of the enemy. They use mission command systems, mobility of their Stryker vehicles, and \nInfantry to initiate the flank attack unaware to the enemy. They capitalize on situations where speed and \nsimplicity are the main factors and, ultimately, keeping the initiative. Usually, a supporting effort engages \nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-7 the enemy ’s front by fire and maneuver while the main effort maneuvers to attack the enemy ’s flank. This \nsupporting effort diverts the enemy ’s attention from the threatened flank.  \n2-30. The primary difference between a flank attack and an envelopment is one of depth. A flank attack is \nan envelopment delivered squarely on the enemy ’s flank. Conversely, an envelopment is a flank attack \ndelivered beyond the enemy ’s flank and into their rear area, but short of the depth associated with a turning \nmovement. Smaller-size tactical units, such as maneuver battalions, companies, and platoons, are more \nlikely to conduct flank attacks than larger tactical units. This is largely a result of troop-to -space ratios and \nsustainment and mission command. (See figure 2-2.) \nLegend:  MGS = mobile gun system \nFigure 2-2. Flank attack \nTURNING MOVEMENT  \n2-31. A turning movement is a form of maneuver in which the attacking force seeks to avoid the enemy’s \nprinciple defensive positions by seizing objec tives behind the enemy’s current positions thereby causing the \nenemy force to move out of their current positions or divert major forces to meet the threat (FM 3-90-1) . \nChapter 2 \n2-8  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  When conducting a turning movement the attacking force avoids the enemy’s main defensiv e positions. \nThe attacking force seizes objectives behind the enemy’s current position which causes the enemy force to \nmove out of his current position or divert major forces to meet the threat.  \n2-32. The SBCT Infantry rifle company uses information sharing through mission command systems with \nthe mobility of the Stryker platform to maneuver in order to seize vital areas in the enemy’s support area \nbefore the main enemy force can withdraw or receive support or reinforcements. A turning movement \ndiffers from envelopment because the force conducting a turning movement seeks to make the enemy force \ndisplace from their current locations. An enveloping force seeks to engage the enemy in their established \nlocation from an unexpected direction. (See figure 2-3.) \nLege nd: MGS = mobile gun system, OBJ = objective \nFigure 2-3. Turning movement \nFRONTAL ATTACK  \n2-33. In a frontal attack  the attacking force destroys a weaker enemy or fixes a larger enemy force in place \nover a broad front ( FM 3-90-1 ). \nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-9 2-34. An attacking force can use a frontal attack to rapidly overrun a weak enemy force. The Stryker \nInfantry rifle company uses a frontal attack with its Infantry their ICVs, MGS, and mortars providing \nsupport by fire. (See figure 2-4.) \nLegend:  MGS = mobile gun system \nFigure 2-4. Frontal attack \nPENETRATION  \n2-35. A penetration is a form of maneuver in which an attacking force seeks to rupture enemy defenses on \na narrow front to disrupt the defensive system (FM 3-90-1). The penetration extends from the enemy’s main \ndefensive positions through the security area into the enemy support area. The Stryker Infantry rifle \ncompany commander employs a penetration when there is no assailable flank, enemy defenses are \noverextended and weak spots are detected in the enemy’s positions , or time pressures do not permit \nenvelopment. They use fires and effects to support maneuvering units. (See figure 2-5.) \nChapter 2 \n2-10  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016\nLegend:  FLOT = forward line of troops, OBJ = objective, PL = phase line \nFigure 2-5. Penetration \nINFILTRATION  \n2-36. An infiltration is a form of maneuver in which an attacking force conducts undetected movement \nthrough or into an area occupied by enemy forces to occupy a position of advantage behind those enemy \npositions while exposing only small elements to enemy defensive fires (FM  3-90-1). Infiltration occurs by \nland, water, air, or a combination of means. Moving and assembling forces covertly through enemy \npositions is time consuming. T o infiltrate successfully, the force avoids detection and engagement. Since \nthis requirement limits the size and strength of the infiltrating force —and infiltrated forces alone can rarely \ndefeat an enemy —infiltration is normally used in conjunction with and in support of other forms of \nmaneuver. \nCOMMON OFFENSIVE PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS \n2-37. The warfighting functions are critical tactical activities the commander can use to review, prepare, \nand execute planning. Synchronization and coordination between the warfighting functions are critical for \nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-11 success. The following paragraphs discuss selected warfighting functions and other additional planning \nconsiderations. \nWARFIGHTING FUNCTIONS \n2-38. The warfighting functions outlines the planning consideration for offense. \nMISSION COMMAND  \n2-39. The commander’s mission and intent determine t he scheme of maneuver and the allocation of \navailable resources. All planning for offensive tasks address the mission variables of METT-TC. The \nmission command function of offensive tasks for the Stryker Infantry rifle company include: \nCommander’s intent.\nMission objectives, to include task and purpose, for each subordinate element.\nScheme of maneuver.\nLocation of key leaders.\nSuspected enemy locations and courses of action.\nCourses of action.\nRequired control measures/graphics.\nPriorities of fire.\nBypass criteria.\nReporting requirements.\nPrimary, alternate, contingency, and emergency (PACE) communications.\nMOVEMENT AND MANEUVER  \n2-40. The commander conducts maneuver to avoid enemy strengths and to create opportunities to increase \nthe effects of friendly fires. The commander achieves surprise by making unexpected maneuvers, rapidly \nchanging the tempo of ongoing missions, avoiding observation, and using deceptive techniques and \nprocedures. The commander seeks to overwhelm the enemy with one or more unexpected actions before \nthe enemy has time to react in an organized fashion. This happens when the company or force conducting \nthe attack is able to attack the enemy from a position of strength or from an unexpected location or \ndirection. The Stryker Infantry rifle company does this. By dismounting at a predetermined point. The \nStryker vehicle is designed to be used as an infantry carrier vehicle for transporting Soldiers safely and \nmore rapidly. The vehicle has the ability to support the infantry platoon while dismounted.  \nFormations \n2-41. The company commander selects what formation and order of units to deploy his forces based on the \nfactors of METT-TC. Each formation provides the commander with flexibility to achieve a specific \noutcome. Commanders can shift formations as needed as factors of METT-TC change to maintain the \ninitiative. \n2-42. Mounted formation selection for the SBCT Infantry rifle company commander occurs from point of \ndeparture until the lead element reaches its dismount point or makes contact and deploys its forces. The \ncompany rapidly shifts to a combination of mounted and dismounted elements working to complement \neach other’s  maneuver. METT-TC will impact the decision making of subordinate leaders to select \nformations that optimally support their maneuver. The compa ny commander’s role is to coordinate the \nmaneuver of its subordinate forces to synchronize their maneuver and formation to accomplish to overall \nmission. \nColumn \n2-43. The column formation allows the company to make contact with one platoon and maneuver with the \ntwo trail platoons. It is a flexible formation, allowing easy transition to other formations. It provides good \nall-around security and allows fast movement. It provides good dispersion and aids maneuver and control, \nespecially in limited visibility. The company can deliver a limited volume of fire to the front and to the \nrear, and a high volume to the flanks. (See figure 2-6.) \nChapter 2 \n2-12  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  \nLegend:  CDR = commander, FIST = fire integration support team, MGS = mobile gun system, MTR = mortar, \nXO = executive officer \nFigure 2-6. Company column with platoons in a wedge and in columns \nCompany Wedge \n2-44. The company wedge formation allows the commander to make contact with a small element and still \nmaneuver the remaining platoons. If the company is engaged from the flank, one platoon is free to \nmaneuver. This formation is hard to control, but it allows faster movement than the company vee \nformation. (See figure 2-7 on page 2-13.) \nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-13 \nLegend:  CDR = commander, FIST = fire integration support team, MGS = mobile gun system, MTRS = \nmortars, XO = executive officer \nFigure 2-7. Company in wedge with platoons in different formations \nCompany Vee \n2-45. The company vee formation has two platoons forward to provide immediate fire on contact or to \nflank the enemy. It has one platoon centered trailing the two forward platoons. If the company is engaged \nfrom either flank, two platoons can provide fire, and at least one platoon is free to maneuver. This \nformation is hard to control and slows movement. The company commander designates one of the forward \nplatoons as the base platoon. (See figure 2-8.) \nChapter 2 \n2-14  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016\nLegend:  CDR = commander, FIST = fire integration support team, MGS = mobile gun system, MTRS = \nmortars, XO = executive officer \nFigure 2-8. Company vee with platoons in different formations \nCompany Line \n2-46. The company line formation puts all platoons forward along the same direction of movement, and it \nprovides for the delivery of maximum fire to the front, but less to the flanks. It is the most difficult \nformation to control. The company commander designates a base platoon, normally the center one, for the \nothers to guide on. Flank and rear security is generally poor, but is improved when the flank platoons use \nechelon formations. (See figure 2-9 on page 2-15.) \nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-15 \nLegend:  CDR = commander, FIST = fire integration support team, MGS = mobile gun system, XO = executive \nofficer \nFigure 2-9. Company line with platoons in wedge formations \nEchelon Right or Left \n2-47. The echelon right or echelon left formation is used if the situation is vague and the company \ncommander anticipates enemy contact to the front or on one of the flanks. Normally, an obstacle or another \nfriendly unit exists on the flank of the company opposite the echeloned flank, preventing enemy contact on \nthat side. This formation provides a good volume of fire and protection to the echeloned flank, but less to \nthe opposite flank. (See figure 2-10.) \nLegend:  CDR = commander, FIST = fire integration support team, MGS = mobile gun system, MTRS = \nmortars, XO = executive officer  \nFigure 2-10.

The box information is useful when general information about the enemy is known, and the SBCT \nInfantry rifle company requires flexibility and depth in its attack. The diamond formation is a variation of \nthe box formation. The SBCT Infantry rifle company uses box and diamond formations (see figure 2-11) \nwhen it has four maneuver forces. Both the box and the diamond formations — \nProvide the best flexibility for maneuver.\nEnable easy transition into all other formations.\nDistribute firepower forward and to the flanks.\nAre easy to control.\nProvide all-around security.\nFacilitate rapid movement.\nProvide protection of accompanying maneuver enhancement and sustainment elements located\nin the center of the formation.\nLegend:  CDR = commander, FIST = fire integration support team, MGS = mobile gun system, MTR = mortar, \nXO = executive officer \nFigure 2-11.

Combat formations allow a unit to move in the AO in a posture suited to the senior commander’s \nintent and mission. A unit may employ a series of combat formations during the course of an attack; each \nhas its advantages and disadvantages. Subordinate units within a combat formation can employ their own \ncombat formations consistent with their particular situation. The commander considers the advantages and \ndisadvantages of each formation with both mounted and dismounted elements in the areas of leading, \ninfluencing, maintenance, firepower orientation, ability to mass fires, and flexibility when determining the \nappropriate formation for a given situation.  \nMovement Techniques \n2-51. All combat formations use one or more of the three movement techniques which are traveling, \ntraveling  overwatch, or bounding overwatch ( FM 3-90-1).  \nTraveling \n2-52. Continuous movement characterizes the traveling technique. It is best suited for situations in which \nenemy contact is unlikely and speed is important. (See figure 2-12.) \nChapter 2 \n2-18  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016\nLegend:  MGS = mobile gun system \nFigure 2-12. Traveling \nTraveling Overwatch \n2-53. Traveling overwatch is an extended form of traveling that provides additional security when speed is \ndesirable but contact is possible. The intent is to maintain depth, provide flexibility, and maintain the ability \nto maneuver if contact occurs. (See figure 2-13 on page 2-19.) \nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-19 \nLegend:  MGS = mobile gun system \nFigure 2-13. Traveling overwatch \nBounding Overwatch \n2-54. Bounding overwatch is used when contact is expected. It is the most secure, but slowest, movement \ntechnique. The purpose of bounding overwatch is to deploy before contact, giving the unit the ability to \nprotect a bounding element by immediately suppressing an enemy force. The company can employ either \nof two bounding methods; alternate or successive. (See figure 2-14.) \n2-55. A technique to employ for the length of a bound is based on half the distance of the maximum \neffective range of weapon system in the overwatch element. This allows the overwatching element to cover \nthe bounding element by allowing enough range to identify and engage a threat. The bounding element \nselects a covered position within that range and then becomes the overwatching element. \nChapter 2 \n2-20  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016Alternate Bounds \n2-56. Covered by the rear element, the lead element moves forward, halts, and assumes overwatch \npositions. The rear element advances past the lead element and takes up overwatch positions. This sequence \ncontinues, as needed, with only one element moving at a time. This method is usually more rapid than \nsuccessive bounds. \nSuccessive Bounds \n2-57. In the successive bounding method, the lead element covered by the rear element, advances and \nassumes overwatch positions. The rear element then advances to an overwatch position abreast of the lead \nelement, halts, and assumes overwatch. The lead element then moves to the next position, and so on. Only \none element moves at a time, and the rear element avoids advancing beyond the lead element. This method \nis easier to control and more secure than the alternate bounding method, but it is slower. \nLegend:  MGS = mobile gun system \nFigure 2-14 . Bounding overwatch \nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-21 2-58. The commander’s use of standard formations enables the unit to shift rapidly from one formation to \nanother, giving additional flexibility when adjusting to changes in the mission variables. Dismounting \nInfantry platoons will change the pace of the operation and formations will change rapidly and often \nbetween mounted and dismounted elements. (This results from the commander rehearsing subordinates so \nthat they can change formations using standard responses to changing situations, such as actions on \ncontact.) By designating the combat formation planned for use, the commander — \nEstablishes the geographic relationship between units.\nIndicates probable reactions once the enemy makes contact with the formation.\nIndicates the level of security desired.\nEstablishes the preponderant orientation of subordinate weapons systems.\nPostures friendly forces for the attack.\n2-59. The company should try to make enemy contact with the smallest possible friendly force at terms \nthat are favorable. This is achieved by the reconnaissance task conducted by the higher echelon to support \nthe SBCT Infantry rifle c ompany’s maneuver . This allows most of the company freedom to maneuver \nagainst the enemy force. \nINTELLIGENCE  \n2-60. The commander, assisted by the COIST if formed, uses threat templates, the situation template, the \nmost probable COA, the most dangerous COA, civil consideration products, terrain products, and other \nintelligence products to identify any aspect within the operational environment that will affect the friendly \nforce and enemy force. This information may come from the intelligence sections from within the \ncompany, battalion, brigade, or in combination with other intelligence agency or entity. (Refer to \nATP 2-01.3 for more information.)  \n2-61. The attacking unit continuously conducts information collection during the mission because it is \nunlikely that the commander has complete knowledge of the enemy’s intentions and actual actions  but will \nreceive constant updates from higher and adjacent units with sharing of the COP. \nFIRES \n2-62. Leader’s conduct fires planning concurrently with maneuver planning at all levels. Brigade combat \nteam’s (BCT’s ) and SBCT Infantry battalions typically use top-down fire support planning, with bottom-up \nrefinement of the plans. As part of the top-down fire planning system, the battalion includes a fires annex \nwith its OPORD. The company commander refines the fire plan from higher headquarters to meet his \nmission requirements and to ensure that these refinements are incorporated into the higher headquarters ’ \nplan.  \n2-63. A clearly defined concept of operations enables the company commander to articulate precisely how \nhe wants indirect fires to affect the enemy during the different phases of the operation. This allows the \nSBCT Infantry rifle company FSO to develop a fire support plan that supports the SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany’s mission. He has the ability to plan an echelon of fires with access to company mortars using \n60mm dismounted, or 120-mm mounted. It allows the mortar section sergeant to develop their scheme of \nmaneuver and place mortar firing positions. The company can possibly use battalion mortars 120-mm and \n81-mm, fires from the field artillery battalion using 155-mm howitzers, and use of CAS and close combat \nattack (CCA). To develop an effective fires plan, the company FSO understands the commander’s intent to \nconduct the fire planning process and address all the essential elements of a fire support plan. \nSUSTAINMENT  \n2-64. The objective of sustainment in offensive tasks is to ensure the tactical commander maintains the \nmomentum. The commander wants to take advantage of windows of opportunity and launch offensive tasks \nwith minimum advance warning. Therefore, sustainment planners, and operators anticipate these events and \nmaintain the flexibility to support the offensive plan. A key to successful offensive tasks is the ability to \nanticipate the requirement to push support forward, specifically regarding ammunition, fuel, and water. The \n1SG supervising the supply sergeant requests classes of supply packages that are designed specifically to \nthe company. Planning rates of future consumption will need to be factored when the company coordinates \nits resupply at a specific time and location. All Stryker vehicles and personnel can carry up to 72 hours of \nChapter 2 \n2-22  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016supply and conduct resupply to carry that capacity when necessary. (See chapter 8 , sustainment, for more \ninformation.) \nLogistics \n2-65. Sustainment maintains momentum of the attack by delivering supplies as far forward as possible. In \norder for the SBCT Infantry rifle company to get their required supplies it may require them to send combat \npower elements to provide security for the transport of supplies and logistics packages to their company for \nemergency situations or operations beyond 72 hours. The commander can use throughput distribution and \npreplanned and preconfigured packages of essential items to help maintain offensive momentum and \ntempo. The XO and 1SG ensure that the supply packages are arranged according to the company \ncommander’s plan.  \nHealth Service Support \n2-66. The burden on medical resources increases due to the intensity of offensive tasks and the increased \ndistances as the force advances. The commander reallocates medical resources as the tactical situation \nchanges. The 1SG and emergency care sergeant advise the commander to enhance the company’s \nresponsive and effective health service support. \nPROTECTION  \n2-67. The rapid tempo and changing nature of offensive tasks present challenges when protecting friendly \nassets. The forward movement of subordinate units is critical if the commander is to maintain the initiative \nnecessary for successful offensive tasks. Denying the enemy a chance to plan, prepare, and execute an \neffective response to friendly offensive tasks through maintaining a high operational tempo is a key means \nthe commander employs to ensure the survivability of his force. Maintaining a high tempo of offensive \ntasks includes using multiple routes; dispersion; highly mobile forces; piecemeal destruction of isolated \nenemy forces; scheduled rotation and relief of forces before they culminate; keeping an Infantry team with \nthe vehicles for local security; and wise use of terrain. The exact techniques employed in a situation reflect \nthe mission variables. \n2-68. The commander protects subordinate forces to deny the enemy the capability of interfering with \nongoing missions. That protection meets the commander’s legal and moral obligations to the organization’s \nSoldiers. To help protect the force, the commander addresses all protection tasks during the unit’s  planning, \npreparation, and execution, while he assesses the effectiveness of those protection tasks. Some of these \nprotection assets will need to be requested from higher headquarters. (Refer to FM 3-90-1 and ADRP 3-37 \nfor \nmore information.) \nADDITIONAL PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS \n2-69. Additional offensive task planning considerations include the following: \nUrban environment.\nMountainous terrain.\nDesert environment.\nJungle environment.\nSubsurface areas.\nSniper employment considerations.\nAir assault operations.\nURBA N ENVIRONMENT  \n2-70. Offensive tasks in an urban environment aim to destroy, defeat, or neutralize an enemy force. \nHowever, the purpose may be to achieve some effect relating to the population or infrastructure of the \nurban area. No matter the purpose, commanders should use a combined arms approach for successful \noffense. \nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-23 2-71. Stryker Infantry rifle company has a significant advantage in the urban environment during offensive \ntasks with its force structure, technology, firepower, and protection. The force structure allows it to place \nInfantry squads into an urban area that can maneuver, communicate , and interact in close contact with the \nlocal population, and search. It has the firepower to be able to organically conduct dynamic building \nbreaches using MGS or demolition charges if rules of engagement (ROE) allow; suppress or destroy \nsignificant fortified emplacements with the use of .50cals, MK-19s or the MGS; and infiltrate snipers to \nprovide long range precision fires or surveillance. The vehicles themselves provide protection with their \narmor and can engage enemy safely and accurately with the use of the remote weapon station.   \nMOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN  \n2-72. Combat in mountainous terrain presents units with complicated and ever-shifting hazards, \ndifficulties, opportunities, and risks. Mountain combat calls for extreme physical fitness, mental toughness, \nendurance, and the utmost in tactical and technical proficiency on the part of all individuals. A disciplined \nand prepared SBCT Infantry rifle company that is task-organized with and supported by the other members \nof the combined arms team facilitates success. A unit fighting in the mountains overcomes difficulties, \nmeasures risks, and exploits opportunities to close with the enemy and defeat him. Well prepared \ncommanders anticipate, understand, and adapt to the physical demands of mountain environments. They \nface and overcome the challenges of fighting in areas where technological supremacy can be negated by \neven the most crude and nontechnical enemy actions. Leaders should prepare for mountain missions in a \nmanner that allows their units to adapt to the challenges. (Refer to ATTP 3-21.50 for more information.) \n2-73. SBCT Infantry companies conducting offensive, defensive, and stability tasks in mountainous terrain \nare able to adapt and skillfully use the environmental challenges to their advantage. The design of the \nlandscape, coupled with climatic conditions, creates a unique set of characteristics in mountainous terrain \nthat are described below. \nClose Fights With Infantry \n2-74. Mountain combat is close as the opposing forces meet in the rugged terrain. Even though engaging \ntargets near the limits of direct fire weapons does occur in mountain engagements, intervening crests, hills, \nridges, gullies, depressions, and other terrain features often limit long range engagements with the enemy. \nThe upper levels of mountainous terrain are characterized by a lack of trafficable roads. Dismounted units \nexecute the mission when use of motorized vehicles is restricted. The SBCT Infantry rifle company \nSoldiers can use organic air burst munitions that can set conditions to fix or maneuver against the enemy \nthat are behind defilade or in dead space where direct fire weapons have little effect. \nDecentralized Small-Unit Operations \n2-75. Mountainous terrain environments do not support the meeting and maneuver of large units requiring \nconflicts to be fought at the platoon and squad level. Mountainous terrain can separate brigades from \nbattalions, battalions from companies, and companies from platoons for long periods. Communication with \nhigher and adjacent units can be difficult at times. Contingencies for establishing PACE communications \nshould be established. Intent based operations should be clearly communicated to allow platoon and squad \nlevel leaders to take actions according to the commander’s intent in case communications cannot be \nmaintained. \nDegraded Mobility and Increased Movement Times \n2-76. The ruggedness of mountainous terrain may restrict mobility to foot movements using file type \nformations on roads and trails. A relatively short distance from point to point may be an arduous movement \nover steep, rocky, uneven terrain, with multiple trail switchbacks that increase the distance traveled and the \nenergy expended to traverse it. In mountainous terrain, the Infantry dismount to move through defiles, \nchoke points, and other restricted terrain at higher or lower elevations. This allows the Stryker vehicles to \ncarry the majority of the Infantry’s equipment and sustainment needs to lessen the combat load weight. \nPeriodic link up points should be planned along traveled routes to resupply the dismounted force. \nUnique Sustainment Techniques \n2-77. Sustainment in a mountainous terrain is a challenging and time-consuming process. Terrain and \nweather complicate sustainment tasks to include logistics resupply, medical evacuation, CASEVAC, and \nChapter 2 \n2-24  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  Soldier health and hygiene. The network of restrictive mountain roads rarely supports resupply vehicles \nwith a large turning radius, or two-way traffic. Often, vehicle traffic can use more terrain favorable routes \nat lower elevations along the base of mountains and through rivers and streams. Movement of supplies \nincludes air, vehicle, foot, and animal. Each technique has its own challenges in mountainous terrain. \nOperations in Thinly Populated Areas \n2-78. The populace that reside in mountainous terrain live in small villages in the valleys with some \nscattered villages in the upper mountain areas. Although the farmers and animal herders that are most of the \nindigenous population may work in the mountains, the vast amount of mountainous terrain remains \nunpopulated. \n2-79. Mountainous terrain and weather conditions can be both an advantage and a disadvantage to friendly \nor enemy forces. If unprepared, the terrain can be a company's adversary. Personnel prepare mentally and \nphysically, and leaders prepare tactically and logistically to conduct missions in the mountains. Company \nleaders understand physical characteristics of mountainous terrain and how to use terrain and weather to \ntheir advantage. Mountainous terrain is characterized by one or more of the following: \nHigh altitudes.\nGently rolling slopes and steep cliffs.\nVarying amounts of vegetation (heavy, light, or none).\nTimberline.\nRocky ground.\nWet or dry stream beds.\nGlaciated peaks.\nCompartmentalization.\nMountain weather is characterized by the following:\nExtreme conditions (such as scorching hot, subfreezing, violent thunderstorms, and\nblizzards).\nLarge temperature differences between day and night.\nSudden atmospheric disturbances.\nOffensive Tasks in Mountainous Terrain \n2-80. Determining where the enemy is located or suspected to be is a key factor when conducting offensive \ntasks in mountainous terrain. It is extremely difficult to target the enemy in rugged mountainous terrain \nwith physical characteristics such as caves, rock formations, depressions, rifts, and wooded areas. These \noffer excellent cover and concealment to Infantry or paramilitary forces within a dispersed area. The \nsecond factor is determining an appropriate method to fix or place the enemy in a kill zone where they can \nbe attacked without escaping.  \n2-81. The mountainous, restrictive terrain drives most offensive combat tasks to dismounted movements \nwith smaller elements. Correspondingly, tasks tend to become more decentralized and take place at the \nplatoon and squad level. Junior leadership initiative and decisiveness is essential during the conduct of \nthese tasks. \n2-82. Leaders plan offensive engagements on favorable terms to the attacking force. As with all offensive \ntasks, the initiative is with the attacker. The attacker chooses the time, place, and method of attack, while \nthe defender considers all possible methods of attack and avenues of attack. Units can execute effective \nattacks in the mountains with careful planning and preparation. Understanding the enemy and how they use \nmountainous terrain and weather to their advantage is crucial to developing a scheme of maneuver. \nReconnaissance will be limited in gaining timely information because the terrain offers cover and \nconcealment from visual contact and limits signal signatures for both forces. Establishment long duration \nobservations posts (OPs) equipped with enhanced optics from points overwatching likely routes can \nmitigate some of the lack of information. It is beneficial when creating clear, tactical tasks for mission \ncommand, time, and additional combat power to support the mission. Leaders who understand enemy \nmountain tactics are able to use the same mountain characteristics to their advantage. (Refer to \nATTP 3-21.50 for more information .) \nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-25 DESERT E NVIRONMENT  \n2-83. Successful desert operations require adaptation to the environment and to the terrain and climate \nlimitations. Equipment and tactics must be modified and adapted to a dusty and rugged landscape with \nextremes in temperature and where visibility may change from 30 miles to 30 feet in a matter of minutes. \n(Refer to FM 90-3 for more information.) Stryker units often lack the range advantage with MTOE weapon \nsystems to engage targets identified with their sensors. They rely on indirect fires, CAS and CCA, antitank \nguided missile (ATGM) and MGS to mitigate. The Stryker vehicle is also vulnerable in open desert usually \nwhen moving and relies on the terrain for protection by utilizing covered positions in restricted terrain. \nBounding overwatch should be considered as more prevalent movement technique when the enemy force \nhas armored forces or Armor defeating weapon systems with long ranges.  \nJUNGLE E NVIRONMENT \n2-84. Successful offensive tasks in a jungle environment combine dispersion and concentration. For \nexample, a force may move out in a dispersed formation so that it can find the enemy. Once contact is \nmade, its subordinate forces close on the enemy from all directions. Operations are enemy-oriented, not \nterrain-oriented. Wherever the enemy is found, that is where he should be destroyed. If he is allowed to \nescape, he will only have to be found again, with all the risks involved. (Refer to FM 90-5 for more \ninformation.)  \nSUBSURFACE AREAS  \n2-85. A subsurface area is a condition that can be found on all four of the operational environments. \nSubsurface areas are areas below ground level that may consist of underground facilities, passages, subway \nlines, utility tunnels, sewers, and storm drains, caves, or other subterranean spaces. These areas can be used \nfor cover and concealment, troop movement, command and control functions, and engagements, but their \nuse requires intimate knowledge of the area. Knowledge of the nature and location of these subsurface \nareas is of great value to both friendly and enemy forces. To exploit the advantages of subsurface areas, a \nthorough reconnaissance is required. Maximizing the use of these areas could prove to be a decisive factor \nwhile conducting offensive operations.  \nSNIPER EMPLOYMENT  \n2-86. Snipers are organic to the SBCT Infantry rifle company. Snipers and observers play a critical role in \nInfantry company operations. Well-trained snipers provide the commander accurate, discriminating, long-\nrange small-arms fire, and direct observation of key terrain and avenues of approach. The two best uses of \nsniper fire or long-range precision fire are against key targets beyond the range of organic rifles and \nautomatic weapons, or against any targets that other weapon systems cannot destroy due to range, size, \nlocation, visibility, or security and stealth requirements. Sniper TTP enables them to directly gather and \nrelay critical, detailed enemy information. Sniper effectiveness is measured by more than casualties or \ndestroyed targets. Commanders know snipers affect enemy activities, morale, and decisions. Knowing \nsnipers are present hinders the enemy ’s movement, and creates confusion and continuous personal fear. It \ndisrupts enemy operations and preparations, and compels the enemy to divert forces to deal with the \nsnipers. (Refer to TC 3-22.10 for more information.) \n2-87. During the offense, snipers help the commander accomplish the mission by — \nObtaining information.\nDepriving the enemy of resources.\nDeceiving or diverting the enemy from the main effort.\nKeeping the enemy from regrouping or repositioning.\nConducting preemptive attacks to gain the initiative.\nDisrupting enemy offensive actions.\n2-88. During the conduct of offensive tasks, snipers infiltrate enemy areas and engage them from \nunexpected directions. The teams should move out well in advance of the projected movement. This allows \nthem to move at their own pace so they remain undetected. It also allows them to engage any targets that \nthreaten the advance. The teams may use normal stalking methods, or they can be inserted by ground \nvehicle, helicopter, parachutes, or boats. Their precision fire reduces delays during the hasty attack. \nChapter 2 \n2-26  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 20162-89. In a deliberate attack, snipers can be effectively employed near the fire support element. Their \naccuracy and optics enable them to reduce enemy targets in the midst of friendly forces. During a deliberate \nattack, the unit should take care to avoid drawing enemy attention to the sniper team’s position. The team \nmay be deployed forward of the fire support (FS) element to support the attack, with accurate selective rifle \nfire, or deployed with a cutoff force with the same task. They infiltrate behind the enemy positions to \ndisrupt counterattacks or withdrawal and to harass enemy reinforcements if time permits. (Refer to \nTC 3-22.10 for more information.)  \nAIR ASSAULT  \n2-90. The Stryker Infantry rifle company participates in air assault operations as part of an air assault task \nforce (AATF), led by a battalion headquarters or higher. When the mission variables of METT-TC require \nInfantry Soldiers to conduct offensive tasks beyond the capabilities of their Stryker vehicles. This occurs \nwhen speed and difficult terrain are factors. Air assault operations can be conducted by purely Infantry or \nin conjunction with another Stryker mounted element. \n2-91. Air assaults operations should not be employed in roles requiring deliberate operations over an \nextended period of time, and is best employed in situations that provide a calculated advantage due to \nsurprise, terrain, threat, or mobility. In particular air assault operations are conducted when — \nMassing or shifting combat power quickly.\nUsing surprise.\nUsing flexibility, mobility, and speed.\nGaining and maintaining the initiative.\n2-92. The following are basic planning considerations for the SBCT Infantry Rifle company when \nparticipating in air assault operations: \nAir assault operations are best conducted at night or during weather conditions that allow\naircraft operation, but obscure enemy observation to facilitate deception and surprise.\nFire support planning provides suppressive fires along air routes and in the vicinity of LZs.\nPriority for fires should be to the suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) systems. Upon\nlanding the ground force is responsible for identifying and marking targets.\nThe initial assault force requires enough combat power to seize the LZ upon landing, establish\nair control over the LZ, and conduct clearance of fires as part of the air-ground operations.\nThe LZ control makes the decision for landing follow on forces based upon established criteria\ndeveloped during planning or discovered during execution.\nContingency plan to respond to downed aircraft.\nInfantry unit operations are not fundamentally changed by integrating with aviation units.\nHowever, tempo and distance are dramatically changed.\nVULNERABILITIES  \n2-93. An AATF uses helicopters to move to and close with the enemy. Initial assault elements should \nminimize the amount of equipment and the number of personnel to assure mobility. They are often \nseparated from weapon systems, equipment, and materiel that provide protection and survivability on the \narea of operation. (Refer to FM 3-99 for more information.) An AATF is particularly vulnerable to \nenemy — \nAttack by aircraft and air defense weapon systems during the movement phase.\nAttack by CBRN weapons because of limited CBRN protection and decontamination\ncapability.\nAttack by ground, air, or artillery during the loading and landing phases.\nAir strikes due to limited availability of air defense weapon system s.\nElectronic attack, to include jamming of communications and navigation systems, and\ndisrupting aircraft survivability equipment.\nSmall-arms fire which presents a large threat to helicopters during the air movement and\nlanding phases.\nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-27 SECTION II – MOVEME NT TO CONTACT \n2-94. Movement to contact  is an offensive task designed to develop the situation and establish or regain \ncontact (ADRP 3-90). When necessary, the SBCT Infantry rifle company can conduct this task regardless \nof which decisive action element is currently predominate —offense, defense, or stability. Units plan and \nconduct movement to contact to gain or regain contact with the enemy. It ends when they make enemy \ncontact. The company usually conducts a movement to contact as part of an SBCT Infantry battalion or \nlarger element. Based on mission variables, the SBCT Infantry rifle company may conduct the task \nindependently. Movement to contact includes search and attack and cordon and search. \n2-95. Purposeful and aggressive movement, decentralized control, and the hasty deployment of formations \nfrom the march to conduct offensive, defensive, or stability tasks characterize a movement to contact. The \nfundamentals of an movement to contact are as follows: \nFocus all efforts on finding the enemy.\nMake initial contact with small, mobile, self-contained forces to avoid decisive engagement of\nthe main body on ground chosen by the enemy. This allows the commander maximum\nflexibility to develop the situation.\nTask-organize the force and use movement formations to deploy and attack rapidly in any\ndirection.\nKeep subordinate forces within supporting distances to facilitate a flexible response.\nMaintain contact regardless of the COA adopted once contact is gained.\nORGANIZATION OF FORCES \n2-96. The SBCT Infantry rifle company organizes for a movement to contact with a forward security force \nand a main body. A portion of the main body composes the commander’s sustaining base. Based on the \nmission variables of METT-TC, the battalion commander may increase the SBCT Infantry rifle c ompany’s \nsecurity force by attaching the Scout platoon. This usually happens when the SBCT Infantry battalion is \nconducting a movement to contact and the SBCT Infantry rifle company is the advance guard for the \nbattalion. The security force for the company can be an Infantry rifle platoon, MGS platoon, or battalion \nscout platoon if attached or combination of any of these elements. Snipers can also be assigned to this \nelement to provide assistance. \nSECURITY FORCE  \n2-97. A security force is comprised of four elements; covering force, advance guard, flank guard, and rea r \nguard. For the SBCT Infantry rifle company its covering force and advance guard are normally the same \nelement and normally one of its SBCT Infantry rifle platoons. \nCovering Force \n2-98. Normally the lead squad of the Infantry rifle platoon will serve as a covering force providing early \nwarning allowing the SBCT Infantry rifle platoon following as the advance guard fix the enemy force when \nit makes contact. \n2-99. The primary advantage to having a covering force is the early and accurate reporting about the \nenemy and terrain. This force must be prepared to fight for information against an enemy. Depth is \nessential to providing early warning and reaction time for leaders at the platoon, company, and battalion \nlevels. It enables leaders to conduct actions on contact that preserve the parent unit’s freedom of movement \nand maneuver. This security element is normally the unit’s initial main effort.  \nAdvance Guard \n2-100. The purpose of the SBCT Infantry rifle platoon or company, when it is serving as the advance guard \nof a larger force, is to protect the main body from surprise attack, develop the situation to protect the \ndeployment of the main body, and fix the enemy’s main body. The advance guard’s responsibilities include \nthe following: \nProvide security and early warning for the main body and facilitate its uninterrupted advance.\nChapter 2 \n2-28  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016Conduct reconnaissance to locate enemy forces along the battalion’s axis of ad vance.\nConduct actions on contact to retain freedom of maneuver for the battalion.\nCall for indirect fires to impede or harass the enemy.\nDestroy enemy reconnaissance elements.\nFind, fix, or contain enemy main body to retain freedom of maneuver for the battalion.\nBypass and report obstacles or act as the battalion support or breach force during breaching\noperations.\n2-101. The composition of the advance guard depends on METT-TC factors. In open terrain, the guard may \nmove mounted in restricted, close, complex, or the urban environment. In severely restrictive terrain \nInfantry maneuver with vehicles in the overwatch may be a better choice. The SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany has the flexibility to accomplish this mission mounted or dismounted.  \n2-102. The advance guard is the battalion commander’s main effort until the main body is committed; \nthen priority of fires shifts to the main body. Each decision point (DP) should be based on the actions of the \nadvance guard in some circumstances. \nFlank and Rear Guard \n2-103. Platoon-size elements from one of the SBCT rifle company serve as the flank guard for both the \nbattalion and company. This is done through formation selection. Normally this element conducts a moving \nflank screen using alternating or successive bounds with squads or section. These elements remain at a \ndistance from the main body. Flank security elements operate far enough out to prevent the enemy from \nsurprising the main body with direct fires.  \n2-104. The company provides its own rear security, assisted by rapid forward movement, which gives the \nenemy less opportunity to react or reposition forces to attack the battalion. Units plan indirect fires on \nmajor flank and approaches to enhance security. Upon switching from a movement to contact to an attack, \nthis platoon will normally conduct follow and support of the main body. \nMAIN BODY \n2-105. The combat elements of the main body are prepared to deploy and maneuver rapidly to a DP in the \nAO to destroy the enemy. The main body keys its movement to the advance guard. It maintains information \nof the advance guard’s activities via FM crosstalk or digital communication, primarily FBCB 2. The main \nbody, remaining attuned to the advance guard’s situation, provides responsive support when the advance \nguard is committed.  \n2-106. Tasks the company can perform within the main body include the following: \nFind, fix, defeat, destroy, or contain the enemy’s main body, followed by an assault on the\nenemy force or initiate exploitation.\nExecute a course of action to defeat or destroy designated enemy main body elements.\n2-107. The use of standard formations and battle drills allows the battalion commander, using the \ninformation available to him through the Army Mission Command System (AMCS), to shift combat power \nrapidly in the AO. Companies employ the appropriate movement techniques within the battalion formation. \nCompany commanders, based on their knowledge of the commander’s intent and their own SA, anticipate \nthe battalion commander’s decisions for commitment of the main body and plan accordingly.  \nCONTROL MEASURES \n2-108. The task usually starts from a line of departure (LD) at the time specified in the OPORD. The \ncommander controls the movement to contact by using phase lines, contact points, target reference points \n(TRPs), and checkpoints as required. Soldiers should be mindful of surface danger zones of their weapon \nsystems to prevent friendly fire or collateral damage. The commander controls the depth of the movement \nto contact by using a limit of advance (LOA) or a forward boundary. The commander could designate one \nor more objectives to limit the extent of the movement to contact and orient the force. However, these are \noften terrain-oriented and used only to guide movement. Although a movement to contact may result in \nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-29 taking a terrain objective, the primary focus should be on the enemy force. The commander should plan \nsome other type of offensive action if he has enough intelligence to locate significant enemy forces.  \n2-109. Comp any commanders use positive control over maneuver units, coupled with battle drills and \nformation discipline. The commander can designate a series of phase lines that can successively become \nthe new rear boundary of the forward security elements as that force advances. Each rear boundary \nbecomes the forward boundary of the main body and shifts as the security force moves forward. The rear \nboundary of the main body designates the rear security element’s limit of responsibility. This line shifts as \nthe main body moves forward. \nPLANNING A MOVEMENT TO CONTACT \n2-110. Planning a movement to contact allows for flexibility and promotes subordinate initiative. \nDeveloping the concept of the operation needs to have an emphasis on ultimate control of the objective, \nand conducting a reverse planning sequence from the objective to the LD. This is accomplished by issuing \na clear command er’s intent, developing a simple concept of operations, and developing a series of decision \npoints to execute maneuver options. Units place increased emphasis on developing an aggressive and \nflexible information collection effort that is linked to the comm ander’s priority intelligence requirement \n(PIR) focusing on locating and identifying the enemy’s strength, disposition, and activities.  \n2-111. The commander conducts information collection tasks to determine the enemy’s location and \nintent while conducting security operations to protect the main body. This includes the use of available air \nassets, manned and unmanned. This enables the main body to focus on planning and preparation, to include \nrehearsals of: hasty attacks, bypass maneuvers, and hasty defenses. The plan addresses actions anticipated \nby the commander based on available intelligence and the conduct of meeting engagements and other \nanticipated battle drills. \nPREPARING FOR A MOVEMENT TO CONTACT \n2-112. The preparations for a movement to contact are the same as those for an attack. To avoid \nredundancy see the appropriate paragraph of Section VI, Attack, of this chapter for more information on \nthis subject. \nEXECUTING A MOVEMENT TO CONTACT \n2-113. Each element of the force synchronizes its actions with adjacent and supporting units, maintaining \ncontact and coordination as prescribed in orders and unit SOP. This section discusses executing a \nmovement to contact using the sequence of the offense discussed in Section II of this chapter. \nGAIN AND MAINTAIN ENEMY CONTACT  \n2-114. The commander conducts reconnaissance by using all available information collection assets to \nfind the enemy’s location and dispositions. Sensors alone cannot confirm the exact disposition and location \nof all enemy forces. Infantry should dismount their vehicles prior to the last known point of enemy \ndetection. This ensures that the commander can commit friendly forces under optimal conditions. The \ncommander uses all available sources of combat information and intelligence reports to find the enemy ’s \nlocation and dispositions.  \nDISRUPT THE ENEMY  \n2-115. Once contact is made, the main body brings overwhelming fires onto the enemy to prevent him \nfrom conducting either a spoiling attack or organizing a coherent defense. The security force maneuvers as \nquickly as possible to find gaps in the enemy ’s defenses. The commander gathers as much information as \npossible about the enemy ’s dispositions, strengths, capabilities, and intentions. As more intelligence \nbecomes available, the main body attacks to destroy or disrupt enemy command and control centers, fire \ncontrol nodes, and communication nets. \n2-116. The Stryker vehicles should maneuver to positions out of enemy contact to engage repositioning \nenemy forces or support the dismounted force with dir ect fire, CASEVAC, mission command capabilities, \nor remounting their vehicles. \nChapter 2 \n2-30  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016FIX THE ENEMY  \n2-117. The commander initiates maneuver at a tempo the enemy cannot match since success in a meeting \nengagement depends on effective actions on contact. The techniques the commander employs to fix the \nenemy when both forces are moving are different than those employed when the enemy force is stationary \nduring the meeting engagement. The SBCT Infantry commander has the organic assets of MGS, ICVs, \nInfantry, mortar section, and sniper team to use in order to fix the enemy through maneuver.  \nMANEUVER  \n2-118. The commander quickly maneuvers his main body to a position of advantage to conduct a \npenetration or envelopment if the security force cannot overrun the enemy with a frontal attack. He uses his \nmission command systems to deploy and direct his forces before the enemy can react effectively or \nreinforce. The commander attempts to defeat the enemy in detail while still maintaining the momentum of \nhis advance. The main body commander resumes the movement to contact after a successful attack. If he \ndid not defeat the enemy, he has three main options —bypass, transition to a more deliberate attack, or \nconduct a defense. \n2-119. The company commander maneuvers his main body elements rapidly to the vicinity of the contact. \nThe intent is to deliver the assault before the enemy can deploy or reinforce his engaged forces. The \ncommander masses effects of organic and augmented assets on the enemy to maneuver forces on attacking \nthe enemy’s flanks and rear before the enemy can counter these action s. He avoids piecemeal commitment \nof squads and platoons until he can seize the initiative and maintain it throughout the attack. The \ncommander uses the security force to fix the enemy while the main body maneuvers to look for an \nassailable flank or he uses the main body to fix the enemy while the security force finds the assailable \nflank. \nFOLLOW THROUGH  \n2-120. The unit transition back into a movement to contact and continues to advance if the enemy is \ndefeated. The movement to contact terminates when the unit reaches the final objective or limit of advance \nor it transitions to a more deliberate attack, defense, or retrograde. \nSEARCH AND ATTACK \n2-121. Search and attack is a decentralized movement to contact, requiring multiple, and coordinated \nreconnaissance patrols to locate and destroy the enemy . It is most often used when operating within \nnoncontiguous areas of operation during a small scale contingency (SSC ). The SBCT Infantry battalion \nconducts this form of the movement to contact to destroy enemy forces, deny the enemy certain areas, to \nprotect the force, or for information collection. Execution of the search-and-attack will typically be by \ncompany-sized elements in battalion-sized AOs . This is based on their speed with the mobility of the \nStryker vehicle and flexibility of their organic task organization primarily in the SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompanies. The SBCT may task its subordinate units to conduct the following missions:  \nLocate enemy positions or habitually traveled routes.\nDestroy enemy forces within its capability, or fix and block the enemy until reinforcements\narrive.\nMaintain surveillance of a larger enemy force through stealth until reinfor cements arrive.\nSearch urban areas.\nSecure military or civilian property or installations.\nORGANIZATION OF FORCES FOR A SEARCH AND ATTACK  \n2-122. The commander task-organizes the unit into  reconnaissance, fixing, and finishing forces, each \nwith a specific purpose and task. The size of the reconnaissance force is based on the available intelligence \nabout the size of enemy forces in the AO. The nature of the operational environment sometimes requires an \nSBCT Infantry rifle company to conduct a search and attack while operating in a noncontiguous AO. The \ncommander primarily employs ground forces when the enemy is operating with small, dispersed elements \nor when the task is to deny the enemy the ability to move within a given area. \nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-31 Reconnaissance \n2-123. The reconnaissance force conducts a zone reconnaissance to reconnoiter identified named areas of \ninterest (NAIs). Once detection is made it is confirmed, preferably through visual contact. The \nreconnaissance force is small enough to achieve stealth, but large enough to provide adequate self-defense \nuntil the fixing and finishing forces arrive. \nFixing \n2-124. The fixing force develops the situation, and then executes one of two options based on the \ncommander ’s guidance and METT-TC. The first option is to block identified routes that the enemy can use \nto escape or to be reinforced. The fixing or support by fire force maintains contact with the enemy and \npositions its forces to isolate and fix him before the finishing force attacks. The second option is to conduct \nan attack to fix the enemy in his current position until the finishing force arrives. The fixing force can be a \ncombination of MGS, ICVs, and Infantry that can be supported by the mortar section. The fixing force \nrequires enough combat power to isolate the enemy once the reconnaissance force finds him. The fixing \nforce attacks if that action meets the commander ’s intent and it can generate sufficient combat power \nagainst the enemy.  \nFinishing \n2-125. The commander uses his finishing force to destroy the detected and fixed enemy during a search \nand attack. The SBCT Infantry rifle company has many organic assets to use in synchronization of \nmaneuver with a combination of mounted, dismounted, and indirect. The SBCT Infantry rifle company \nfinishes the enemy force in close combat using dismounted Infantry. They are supported by precision of \ncrew served weapons on the remote weapons station, MGS, and mortar indirect fires from longer distances \nto isolate the objective, destroy a retreating force, or disrupt an enemy counterattack. \nControl Measures for a Search and Attack \n2-126. The commander establishes control measures that allow for decentralized actions and small-unit \ninitiative to the greatest extent possible. The minimum control measures for a search and attack are an AO, \nTRPs, objectives, checkpoints, and contact points. The use of TRPs facilitates responsive fire support once \nthe reconnaissance force makes contact with the enemy. The commander uses objectives and checkpoints \nto guide the movement of subordinate elements. Coordination points indicate a specific location for \ncoordinating fires and movement between adjacent units. The commander uses other control measures , \nsuch as phase lines, as needed. \nPlanning a Search and Attack \n2-127. Applying all of the warfighting functions, the commander conducts a search and attack for one or \nmore of the following purposes: \nDestroy the enemy. Render enemy units in the AO combat-ineffective.\nDeny the area. Prevent the enemy from operating unhindered in a given area; for example, in\nany area he is using for a base camp or for logistics support.\nProtect the force. Prevent the enemy from massing to disrupt or destroy friendly military or\ncivilian operations, equipment, property, and key facilities.\nCollect information. Gain combat information about the enemy and the terrain to confirm the\nenemy COA predicted as a result of the IPB process.\n2-128. The search and attack plan places the finishing force, as the decisive operation, where it can \nmaneuver to destroy enemy forces or essential facilities located by reconnaissance assets. Typically, the \nfinishing force occupies a central location in the AO. However, the mission variables may allow the \ncommander to position the finishing force outside the search and attack area. The commander allocates \nadditional combat power to this decisive operation by using priority of fires and assigning priorities to \navailable combat multipliers, such as engineer elements and helicopter lift support. The commander \nestablishes control measures as needed to consolidate units and concentrate the combat power of the force \nbefore the attack. Once the reconnaissance force locates the enemy, the fixing and finishing forces can fix \nChapter 2 \n2-32  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016and destroy the enemy force. The commander develops a contingency plan in the event that the \nreconnaissance force is compromised. \nExecution of the Search and Attack \n2-129. Each subordinate element operating in its own AO is tasked to destroy the enemy within its \ncapability. The commander should have in place previously established control measures and \ncommunications means between any closing elements to prevent fratricide and friendly fire. The \nreconnaissance force conducts a zone reconnaissance to reconnoiter identified named areas of interest \n(NAIs) \nGain and Maintain Enemy Contact \n2-130. Once the reconnaissance force finds the enemy force, the fixing force develops the situation and \nexecutes one of two options based on the commander ’s guidance and the mission variables of METT-TC. \nThe first option is to block identified routes that the detected enemy can use to escape or rush \nreinforcements over. The fixing force maintains contact with the enemy and positions its forces to isolate \nand fix him before the finishing force attacks. The second option is to conduct an attack to fix the enemy in \ntheir current positions until the finishing force arrives. The fixing force attacks if that action meets the \ncommander ’s intent and it can generate sufficient combat power against the detected enemy.  \nDisrupt the Enemy \n2-131. The commander integrates direct and indirect fires, terrain, and obstacles to upset an enemy’s \nformation or tempo, interrupt the enemy’s timetable, or cause enemy forces to commit prematurely or \nattack in a piecemeal fashion. The force attempting to disrupt an enemy attacks the enemy with enough \ncombat power to achieve desired results with one mass attack or sustain the attack, until it achieves the \ndesired results. It may involve attacking the enemy force while it is still in its assembly areas or in an \napproach march before it can deploy into a combat formation. \nFix the Enemy \n2-132. If conditions are unfavorable for using the finishing force or the main body to attack the detected \nenemy, the reconnaissance or the fixing force can continue to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance \nactivities to further develop the situation. Whenever this occurs, the force maintaining surveillance avoids \ndetection and possible enemy ambushes. \nManeuver \n2-133. The finishing force may move behind the reconnaissance and fixing forces, or it may locate at a \nPZ and air assault into a LZ near the enemy once he is located. The finishing force or the main body is \nresponsive enough to engage the enemy before he can break contact with the reconnaissance force or the \nfixing force. The commander provides additional mobility assets so the finishing force and main body can \nrespond within that timeframe.  \n2-134. The commander may have the finishing force or the main body established in an area ambush and \nuse the reconnaissance and fixing forces to drive the enemy into the ambushes. \nFollow Through \n2-135. After the search and attack the commander transitions to the appropriate task; continuing offensive \ntasks , defensive tasks or stability tasks .  \nCORDON AND  SEARCH \n2-136. A common tactical mission during operations focused on stability tasks is a cordon and search. \nThe purpose of cordon and search is to obtain weapon caches, materiel or information, a specific high-\nvalue target , or persons of interest. Biometric identity data collection enables cordon and search mission by \nidentifying the persons of interest. A cordon and search involves two processes —limiting freedom of \nmovement and searching dwellings. These two actions have the potential to produce negative \nconsequences; therefore, organizing cordon and search elements requires extensive mission tailoring. \nCommanders are prepared for a civil disturbance. (Refer to ATP 3-06.20 for more information.) \nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-33 2-137. Searches are an important aspect of populace and resource control. The need to conduct search or \nto employ search procedures is a continuous requirement. A search can orient on people, materiel, \nbuildings, or terrain. A search usually involves both civil police and Soldiers. \n2-138. Cordon and search involve isolating the target area and searching suspected buildings to capture or \ndestroy possible insurgents or contraband. It involves the emplacement of a cordon, or security perimeter, \nto prevent traffic in and out of the area. The cordon permits the search element to operate unimpeded within \nthe secured area. The Stryker vehicle provides a means of establishing traffic control points by using its \nsize to block high speed avenues of approach. When paired with another Stryker vehicle at a point it can \nprovide coverage on both inner and outer cordon security. The remote weapon system (RWS) allows the \nvehicle to engage targets at a distance or in buildings. The top hatches on the rear of the vehicle allow \nadditional personnel to provide security from a protected position. The vehicles themselves are vulnerable \nto dismounted attacks in close proximity and benefit greatly when protected by dismounts. \n2-139. There are two cordon and search techniques: cordon and kick, and cordon, knock, and ask. The \ncordon and search method selected to accomplish the mission is dependent on a number of factors. The \nprimary consideration is to capture the designated personnel, site, or equipment. Additional factors such as \nthe enemy threat, local populace support, and HNSF capabilities are taken into account during operation \nplanning. \nCordon and kick. The cordon and kick method is used to maintain speed, surprise, and\ntimeliness during entry to the target within the objective. In this instance, considerations of\npopulation perceptions and integration of HNSF are less important than accomplishing the\ntask(s) of capturing the target individual, site, or equipment. Proper safety precautions will\nneed to be strictly followed. The Infantry platoon can also conduct a dynamic breach with use\nof demolitions and engineers or conduct entering and clearing techniques through available\nentry points of the buildings. The MGS vehicle can provide a means for creating a breaching\npoint in a target building if ROE allows.\nCordon, knock, and ask. If the mission is focused on increasing the legitimacy of the host\nnation (HN) government and security forces, it may be necessary to sacrifice a degree of\nsurprise and timeliness to achieve that goal. In this instance, the unit focuses on maintaining a\npresence and control of an area by incorporating local authorities into the mission.\nORGANIZATION OF FORCES FOR A CORDON AND SEARCH  \n2-140. A cordon and search requires four elements to perform the major tasks —a command element, a \nsecurity element, a search and assault element, and a support element. The security element sets up the \ncordon, which usually comprises an outer cordon “ring” and an inner cordon “ring.” The search and assault \nelement is the decisive operation and will clear and search suspected buildings to capture or destroy \ninsurgents or contraband. The support element may be the reserve, provide support by fire, and be prepared \nto perform the other cordon and search tasks. \nCommand Element \n2-141. The command element is the headquarters, usually from a battalion, that executes mission \ncommand for the cordon and search mission and may have several combat multipliers attached. Frequently, \nthe commander is given a variety of assets to assist him in accomplishing his mission. Ideally, the \ncommander task-organizes his assets and maintains control of no more than three to five elements. \nSubordinate command elements, such as company headquarters, can provide mission command functions \nfor efforts if the force has more than three to five elements. \n2-142. The location of the command element provides the ability to control the subordinate teams and \nsupporting assets of the cordon and search mission. The ability to observe the search and assault element \ngenerally causes the command element to collocate with the inner cordon. Visibility and communications \ncapability are deciding factors in identifying the best location for the command element during the actual \nmission. \n2-143. The command element may be only a commander and a radio operator, or may include security \nvehicles, interpreters, host nation officials, or local authorities. The command element remains mobile and \nable to move to any point within the cordon and search operation to ensure coordination of all elements and \nChapter 2 \n2-34  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016supporting assets. When HN forces or authorities are involved in the operation, the command element \ncoordinates with them and integrates them as identified during the planning phase of the operation. \nOperation and communications security is the guiding principle when conducting unified action with HN \nforces. \n2-144. The command element is the single point of coordination for supporting assets and for status \nreporting to higher headquarters. The command element is a critical component of the cordon and search \noperation so an alternate element is designated in the event it becomes combat ineffective. The command \nelement ensures that all actions are documented when necessary and that the rules of engagement are \nfollowed. The command element monitors the documentation, security, and transport of every person \ndetained. The command element ensures that damage caused during the cordon and search is documented \nto identify legitimate future claims by the occupants of the target. \nSecurity Element \n2-145. The security element’s primary task is to isolate the target area. The security element limits enemy \nor civilian influence in the objective area and prevents targets from escaping the cordon. It is usually \ncomprised of a Stryker Infantry rifle platoon. It can be task-organized with sniper, MGS, and mortar section \nto assist with isolating the target area. They may have to use multiple avenues of approach and operate \ndecentralized to accomplish their mission. They may have to establish multiple blocking positions and \nobservation posts and conduct patrols to isolate the target area. The security element may include — \nVehicle-mounted sections or platoons.\nInterpreter(s).\nDetainee teams.\nCrowd control teams.\nTraffic control points or blocking positions.\nHNSF (military or police).\nIntegrated aviation assets.\nInfantry squads or platoons.\nFemale search teams.\nSmall unmanned ground vehicles (SUGV) to assist in searches.\nNonlethal munitions (for example, rubber pellets, bean bag rounds, and tear gas.) for crowd\ncontrol.\nBiometric identify data collection team.\n2-146. The execution of the outer cordon mission is an integral part of the security element in any cordon \nand search mission. The outer cordon isolates the objective area and prevents enemy or civilian influence. \nAs such, it requires detailed planning, coordination, integration, and synchronization to achieve the \ncombined arms effects, lethal and nonlethal, required for mission execution. Some considerations for the \nouter cordon include — \nVehicles for traffic control points or blocking positions.\nFire planning and coordination.\nOverwatch positions.\nAviation assets to observe target area and inform outer cordon if vehicles or persons leave the\ntarget area. Constant communication between the aviation element and the outer cordon\nfacilitate the isolation of the target area.\nAn initial detainee collection point for the receipt and temporary holding of detainees.\nAn initial material collection point for consolidation of captured material.\n2-147. Each subordinate outer cordon element (traffic control point, blocking position) has a designated \nleader and a clear task and purpose. Weapons systems to consider for outer cordon positions are primarily \nICV and MGS variants with RWS, crew-served weapons, javelin with the command launch unit (CLU), \nand snipers or designated marksman. Keeping dismounts in close proximity and to the rear of the vehicles \nincrease their security.  \nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-35 2-148. The leader of the outer cordon element develops and maintains SA of his area of responsibility and \nthe areas of the inner cordon and the search elements. This enables him to anticipate threat activity, control \ndirect and indirect fires, and facilitate the achievement of the outer cordon’s task and purpose. Aviation \nassets, communications systems, and reporting procedures are implemented to facilitate SA for the entire \nelement. \nSearch and Assault Element \n2-149. The search and assault element’s mission is to assault, clear, and search the objective to capture, \nkill, or destroy the targeted individuals or materials. The search and assault is one or more Stryker Infantry \nrifle platoons. An MGS vehicle can be task-organized to this element to create a breach point or provide \nsupport by fire (See Appendix A for more information). The search and assault element initiates action \nonce the outer and inner cordons are in place. The element accomplishes its mission by gaining a foothold \non or in the target to clear all enemy and noncombatant personnel, and by conducting a systematic search of \nthe target areas. These areas may be searched selectively (only specific rooms, buildings, or blocks) or \nsystematically (everything within a given area). Due to the split-second decisions that have to be made, it is \nimperative that this element thoroughly understands the ROE and can execute in a dynamic environment. \n2-150. To accomplish its mission the search and assault element has three primary tasks —securing, \nclearing, and searching the target. The search and assault element may be task-organized into four teams —\nassault, search, security, and support to facilitate accomplishing its mission. All of these teams understand \nand prepare to assume the role of the other teams in the search and assault element. \nSite Exploitation \n2-151. Site exploitation (SE) is systematically searching for and collecting information, material, and \npersons from a designated location and analyzing them to answer information requirements, facilitate \nsubsequent operations, or support criminal prosecution.  \nPrimarily, SE is a means of gathering information that supports the intelligence process. Three\npurposes for SE are —\nTo answer information requirements (usually commander’s critical in formation\nrequirements [CCIRs] ). \nTo facilitate subsequent operations (already planned or not yet anticipated).\nTo facilitate criminal prosecution by host-nation or international authorities (related to war\ncrimes). \n2-152. SE missions may concentrate on one fundamental purpose or involve all three simultaneously. The \npurpose of the site exploitation should be considered throughout the commander’s TLPs. The development \nof intelligence, through immediate analysis or off-site processing can enable the commander to target \nadditional objectives. At the company level, many of the SE-related activities answer higher headquarters \nintelligence requirements.  \n2-153. The forces executing SE provide critical data for inclusion in the intelligence process which \nsubsequently supports operations already planned or not yet anticipated. They identify information, \nmateriel, and persons of interest; and collect, record, and preserve these items. After the mission is \ncompleted, they are debriefed by appropriate intelligence representatives, usually the battalion S-2 or the \ncompany COIST. The information (in any medium or form), material, or persons collected are processed \nby the appropriate agencies and analyzed to produce intelligence that will support ongoing or subsequent \noperations. \n2-154. During stability tasks, units can use SE to gain intelligence that supports criminal prosecution by \nhost-nation authorities. Clearly documenting the details surrounding the initial detention, preserving \nevidence and maintaining chain of custody are critical and aid in determining if further detention is \nwarranted, classifying the detainee, developing intelligence, and prosecuting detainees suspected of \ncommitting criminal acts. Documentation should be detailed and answer the six Ws: who, what, when, \nwhere, why, and witnesses. \nChapter 2 \n2-36  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016Support Element \n2-155. The support element reinforces, and is capable of accomplishing, the task and purpose of the unit’s \ndecisive operation. This element is usually task-organized toward a specific purpose and can be comprised \nof any subordinate units with the SBCT Infantry rifle company . The commander may direct the support \nelement to accomplish priority planning tasks. This means that the support element leader is intimately \nfamiliar with all aspects of the cordon and search mission from planning through its completion. \n2-156. The commander identifies the tasks the support element needs to execute. These tasks are \nprioritized and given to the support element leader so he can plan and rehearse these actions according to \nthe commander’s plan. Probable tasks  assigned to the support element during a cordon and search are as \nfollows, but are not limited to — \nReinforce outer and inner cordon.\nClear buildings.\nSearch buildings.\nSecure, safeguard, and escort civilians or detainees.\nSecure and safeguard captured material or equipment.\nBiometric identify data collection team.\nPursues enemy elements that bypass or escape inner and outer cordon.\n2-157. Commitment criteria is a guide to assist the commander in deciding when to commit the support \nelement, but is not intended to be a trigger for employment. Possible commitment criteria are as follows: \nHostile crowd forming around inner cordon.\nLoss of main effort.\nNumerous rooms in building being searched.\nMore than a specified number of detainees.\nEnemy engages inner cordon.\nCONTROL MEASURES FOR A CORDON AND SEARCH  \n2-158. The use of standard tactical control measures is essential to effective mission command over \nforces approaching and conducting cordon and search. \nAssembly areas. Assembly areas are the most convenient areas for staging a cordon and\nsearch due to the relative safety, size, and location. However, commanders assume that all\nfriendly positions are under constant observation. If possible, position assembly areas in\nremote or separate areas or use multiple assembly areas to minimize any enemy surveillance\nefforts.\nCheckpoints. Checkpoints leading to the target and in the objective area are essential in\nensuring that all units arrive at the target in the proper order and on time.\nTarget Reference Points. Weapon orientation for crew served weapons is a key safety\nconsideration. Surface danger zones will need consideration with the types of munitions\npotentially fired from the weapon systems particularly with MGS main gun, .50 cal and\nMK-19 if used. A method of orienting on check points and rally points as TRPs is also\nacceptable.\nRally points. Rally points to and from the objective area allow for cordon and search elements\nto reorganize if units become engaged, lost, have vehicle trouble, or lose communications\nduring ingress and egress from the target.\nPhase lines. Phase lines (PLs) are helpful in controlling cordon and search elements that are\napproaching the target from different directions or at different times.\n2-159. Techniques for cordon and search success are as follows: \nPosition key leaders so that they can see and control all subordinate elements.\nPosition key assets such as crew-served weapons and interpreters at the critical locations.\nBe prepared to move leadership and support assets from one location to another during\nmission execution or as needed.\nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-37 When executing searches and biometrics identity data collection, position vehicles and\npersonnel to be searched so that the security element’s sectors of fi re face to the outside of the\nfriendly element and away from noncombatants.\nKeep the bulk of the forces within the perimeter so that if the situation escalates they are\nessentially in a battle or support by fire position.\nEnsure that all personnel understand the direct fire plan and any contingency plans. For\nexample —\nWhat actions to take in the event a vehicle penetrates a traffic control point (TCP) from\noutside the established perimeter. \nWho engages and with what weapons systems.\nWhen to cease fire, and what signal to use for cease fire.\nPLANNING A CORDON AND SEARCH  \n2-160. Commanders consider numerous factors when planning and preparing for a cordon and search. \nCommanders apply the same steps used in TLP’s, applying the warfighting functions as discussed in \nChapter 1. When the objective of the cordon and search is a high-payoff target (HPT), the planning time \ncan be extremely limited between when a SBCT Infantry rifle company receives the mission from higher \nheadquarters and when it actually executes the mission. Planning time may require planning by key leaders \nof all the elements and accelerated TLPs due to the complexity of the mission and the many assets task-\norganized to support the operation. As in all cases, the quality of the intelligence associated with METT-TC \nis critical. In particular, the “civil  considerations ” variable of METT-TC should be specifically considered, \nand interpreters and biometric tactical collection devices and operators (to positively identify or verify an \nHVI) should be added, as required. (See figure 2-15  on page 2-39.)  \nPREPARING A CORDON AND SEARCH  \n2-161. A search can orient on people, material, buildings, or terrain. It often involves civil police and \nSoldiers. Authority for search has to be carefully reviewed. Military personnel perform searches only in \nareas of military jurisdiction (or where otherwise lawful). They conduct searches only to apprehend \nsuspects or to secure evidence to an offence. Collection of biometric identity data enables the identification \nor verification of people. \n2-162. Soldiers record and maintain the chain of custody for the seizure of contraband, evidence, captured \nenemy or detainee documents, weapons, and materiel, supplies, or other items for the seizure to be of legal \nvalue. Search teams have detailed instructions for handling controlled items. Lists of prohibited or \ncontrolled distribution items should be widely disseminated and on hand during searches. The unit contacts \nmilitary or civil police who work with the populace and the resource control program before the search \nbegin. Units consider the effect of early warning on the effectiveness of their search. \n2-163. A unit conducts search at a pace to help ensure an effective search, but rapidly enough to prevent \nthe enemy from reacting to the search. Soldiers use only the necessary force to eliminate any resistance \nencountered. There should be plans for securing the search area (establishing a cordon) and for handling \ndetained personnel. \nEXECUTING A CORDON AND SEARCH  \n2-164. Cordon and search involves isolating the target area and searching suspected buildings to capture \nor destroy possible insurgents or contraband. \n2-165. An effective cordon is critical to the success of the search effort. Cordons are designed to prevent \npersons of interest from escaping, prevent insurgents from reinforcing, and protect the forces conducting \nthe operation. Based on factors of METT-TC, the SBCT Infantry rifle company can establish an inner \ncordon and an outer cordon. A mounted SBCT Infantry rifle company is best suited to provide the outer \ncordon given its mobility and armaments. Both cordon elements emphasize on inward and outward for \nsecurity purposes. (See figure 2 -15 on page 2-39 .) \n2-166. The outer cordon’s composition and capabilities should be based on METT -TC. The mission of \nthe outer cordon is to provide containment and prevent a high-value target (HVT) from escaping the \nChapter 2 \n2-38  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016objective area. The outer cordon may have to accomplish this task by being more terrain-oriented to \nreemphasize on the most probable avenues of approach into and out of the objective area. The outer cordon \ncan be tasked to block specific locations and prevent escape from inside and interference from outside of \nthe objective area. \n2-167. The mission of the inner cordon is to contain the immediate vicinity of the target to prevent escape \nand provide security to the search and assault element. If the cordon and search is opposed by a hostile \nforce, the inner cordon provides SBF. The inner cordon provides direct fires to suppress the enemy force \nand allow maneuver of the search and assault element to the objective.  \n2-168. Due to the congested nature of the urban environment, direct fire control measures can be \ncomplicated. One proven technique is for the unit to number buildings, letter building corners, and number \nfloors. This way, a request for immediate direct fire suppression can be specific and the risk of collateral \ndamage, and fratricide is reduced. The fire command can be, “IMMEDIATE SUPPRESSION, TWO \nPERSONNEL WITH WEAPONS, BUILDING 23, SIDE A-B, SECOND FLOOR, SECOND WINDOW, \nFIRE WHEN READY”. Fires are precise and accurate as opposed to high volume because of the \ncondensed and compressed nature of the physical area. \nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-39 \nFigure 2-15 . Establishment of a cordon \nSECTION III – ATTACK \n2-169. An attack is an offensive task that destroys or defeats enemy forces, seizes and secures terrain, or \nboth (ADRP 3-90). An attack is a primary offensive task that destroys or defeats enemy forces, seizes and \nsecures terrain, or both. (Refer to FM 3-90-1 for more information.) \n2-170. The primary difference between a deliberate and a hasty attack is the extent of planning and \npreparation that the attacking force conducts. At one end of the continuum, the SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany launches hasty attacks as a continuation of a meeting engagement to exploit a combat power \nadvantage and to preempt enemy actions. At the other end of the continuum, the SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany conducts a deliberate attack from a reserve position or assembly area with detailed knowledge of \nthe enemy, a task organization designed specifically for the attack, and a fully rehearsed plan. Most attacks \nfall somewhere between the two ends of the continuum. \nChapter 2 \n2-40  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  2-171. The commander conducts a deliberate attack against a strong enemy position. As the company \nprepares for the attack, the enemy continues to strengthen his position. A deliberate attack is a fully \nsynchronized mission that employs every available asset against the enemy defense. It is characterized by a \nhigh volume of planned fires, use of major supporting attacks, forward positioning of resources needed to \nmaintain momentum, and operations throughout the depth of enemy positions. Deliberate attacks follow a \npreparatory period that includes planning, reconnaissance, coordination, positioning of follow-on forces \nand reserves, preparation of troops and equipment, rehearsals, and operational refinement. \n2-172. The commander conducts a hasty attack during movement to contact, as part of a defense, or when \nhe determines that the enemy is in a vulnerable position and can be quickly defeated. The SBCT Infantry \nrifle company usually conducts a hasty attack immediately, with available resources. This type of attack \nmay cause the attacking force to lose a degree of synchronization. To minimize this risk, the commander \nmaximizes use of standard formations and well-rehearsed, thoroughly understood battle drills and SOPs. A \nhasty attack often is the preferred option during continuous operations. It enables the commander to \nmaintain the momentum while denying the enemy the time needed to prepare his defenses.  \nORGANIZATION OF FORCES \n2-173. Once the commander determines the scheme of maneuver, the commander task-organizes the \nforce to ensure he has enough combat power to accomplish its mission. The commander organizes into a \nsecurity force, a main body, and a reserve, all of which are supported by some type of sustainment \norganization. The commander should complete any changes in task organization in time to allow units to \nconduct rehearsals with their attached and supporting elements.  \nSECURITY FORCES  \n2-174. Under normal circumstances, the commander resources dedicated security forces during an attack \nonly if the attack will uncover one or more flanks or the rear of the attacking force as it advances. In this \ncase, the commander designates a flank or rear security force and assigns it a guard or screen mission, \ndepending on the mission variables and factors of METT-TC. The security force can be comprised of a \nplatoon, section, or squad, attached with the sniper team. \nMAIN BODY \n2-175. The commander organizes the main body into combined arms formations to conduct the decisive \noperation and necessary shaping operations. The commander aims the decisive operation toward the \nimmediate and decisive destruction of the enemy force, its will to resist, seizure of a terrain objective, or \nthe defeat of the enemy’s plan. The maneuver scheme identifies the decisive operation. All of the force’s \navailable resources operate in concert to assure the success of the decisive operation. The subordinate unit \nor units designated to conduct the decisive operation can change during the course of the attack. The \ncommander designates an assault, breach, and support force if the commander expects to conduct a breach \nduring the attack. The assault force is primarily made of Infantry. The breach force can be a combination of \nInfantry, combat engineers (when augmented), or MGS depending on the obstacle. The support force is \nusually comprised of MGS, the mortar section, and ICV’s using crew served weapons. Infantry can be used \nto provide local security for the Stryker vehicles in the support force. \n2-176. If it is impractical to determine when or where the echelon’s decisive operation will be, such as \nduring a hasty attack, the commander retains flexibility by arranging forces in depth, holding out strong \nreserves, and maintaining centralized control of long-range fire support systems. As soon as the tactical \nsituation develops to allow the commander to designate the decisive operation, the commander focuses \navailable resources to support that decisive operation. Enemy actions, minor changes in the situation, or the \nlack of success by other elements cannot be allowed to divert either forces or their effects from the decisive \noperation ( FM 3-90-1).  \nRESERVE  \n2-177. The commander uses the reserve to exploit success, defeat enemy counterattacks, or restore \nmomentum to a stalled attack. For a company mission, this would usually be a squad-size force. For a \nbattalion mission, it usually is a platoon size element. Once committed, the reserve’s actions normally \nbecome or reinforce the echelon’s decisive operation, and the commander  makes every effort to \nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-41 reconstitute another reserve from units made available by the revised situation. Often the commander’s \nmost difficult and important decision concerns the time, place, and circumstances for committing the \nreserve. The reserve is not a committed force; it is not used as a follow and support force, or as a follow \nand assume force. The commander decides what type of reserve force is best suited according to METT-T C \nwhen using SBCT units. The reserve can be comprised of MGS, Infantry squads with Stryker vehicles or \ncombination of. \n2-178. In the attack, the combat power allocated to the reserve depends primarily on the level of \nuncertainty about the enemy, especially the strength of any expected enemy counterattacks. The \ncommander only needs to resource a small reserve to respond to unanticipated enemy reactions when \ndetailed intelligence about the enemy exists. When the situation is relatively clear and enemy capabilities \nare limited, the reserve may consist of a small fraction of the command. When the situation is vague, the \nreserve may initially contain most of the commander’s combat power ( FM 3-90-1). \nSUS\nTAINMENT ORGANIZATION  \n2-179. The commander resources his sustainment assets to support the attacking force. The commander \norganizes the supporting sustainment and other logistics assets into combat and field trains and they are \noverseen by the 1SG .  \nCONTROL MEASURES FOR AN ATTACK \n2-180. Units conducting offensive tasks are assigned an AO within which to operate. Within the AO the \ncommander designates the following control measures regardless of whether the attack takes place in a \ncontiguous environment or a noncontiguous environment:  \nAOs for all pertinent battalion level and below subordinate, adjacent, host-nation, or allied\nforces within the operating area .\nPL as the LD, which also may be the line of contact (LC).\nTime to initiate the mission.\nObjective.\n2-181. The commander can use any other control measures necessary to control the attack. Short of the \nLD and LC, the commander may designate assembly areas and attack positions where the unit prepares for \noffensive tasks or waits for the establishment of the required conditions to initiate the attack. Beyond the \nLD and LC, the commander may designate checkpoints, PLs, probable line of deployment (PLD), assault \npositions, direct fire control measures, and fire support coordination measures. A final coordination line \n(FCL), assault positions, SBF, and attack by fire positions, and time of assault to further control the final \nstage of the attack can be used between the PLD and the objective. Beyond the objective the commander \ncan impose an LOA if the commander does not want the unit to conduct exploitation or a pursuit \n(FM 3-90-1 ). \nPLANNING AN ATTACK \n2-182. Friendly forces seek to place the enemy in a position where the enemy can easily be defeated or \ndestroyed in an attack. The commander seeks to keep the enemy off-balance while continually reducing the \nenemy’s options. In an attack the commander focuses movement and maneuver effects, supported by the \nother warfighting functions, on those enemy forces that seek to prevent the unit from accomplishing its \nmission and seizing its objective. Planning helps the commander synchronize the effects of combat power \nthrough TLPs. (Refer to ADP  5-0 for more information ). \nMISSION COMMAND  \n2-183. The commander states the desired effect of fires on the enemy weapons systems, such as \nsuppression or destruction, as part of his planning process. The commander assigns subordinate units their \nmissions and imposes the control measures needed to synchronize and maintain control over the operation. \nHe plans redundant forms of communication to his subordinate units to facilitate quick and timely \nresponses to adjustments to the plan. These forms of communication will often change between voice, \ndigital, and visual signals as phases of the operation are completed. \nChapter 2 \n2-42  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 20162-184. The commander determines the probable LC and enemy trigger lines using the enemy situational \nand weapons templates previously developed. As the commander arrays subordinate elements to shape the \nAO, fri endly weapons systems are matched against the enemy’s to determine the PLD. Once the \ncommander determines the PLD, he establishes how long it takes subordinates to move from the LD to the \nPLD and any support-by-fire positions the attack requires. The commander establishes when and where the \nforce maneuvers into enemy direct-fire range.  \n2-185. Every attack plan contains provisions for exploiting success or any advantages that may arise to \naccomplish the mission. The commander exploits success by aggressively executing the plan, promoting \nsubordinate leader initiative, and using units that can rapidly execute battle drills. \nMOVEMENT AND MANEUVER  \n2-186. In the plan of attack, the commander seeks to surprise the enemy by choosing an unexpected \ndirection, time, type, or strength for the attack and by exploiting the success of military deception \noperations. Surprise delays enemy reactions, overloads and confuses enemy mission command, induces \npsychological shock in the enemy, and reduces the coherence of the enemy defense. The commander \nachieves tactical surprise by attacking in bad weather and over seemingly impassible terrain, conducting \nfeints and demonstrations, maintaining a high tempo, destroying enemy forces, and employing sound \noperations security (OPSEC). The commander plans different attack times for the decisive and shaping \noperations to mislead the enemy and allow the shifting of supporting fires to successive attacking echelons. \nHowever, simultaneous attacks provide a means to maximize the effects of mass in the initial assault. They \nprevent the enemy from concentrating defensive fires against successive attacks.  \n2-187. When planning an attack, the commander and subordinate leaders focus on the routes, formations, \nnavigational aids, dismount locations, or dismount criteria they will use to traverse the ground from the LD \nor PD to the objective. Some terrain locations may require the attacking unit to change its combat \nformation, direction of movement, or movement technique when it reaches those locations. SBCT \ncommanders need to consider how and where they will use the MGS platoon in the attack. This includes \nthe MGS task organization with techniques of keeping them pure with company commander control, \nassigning a squad for their additional protection, task organizing one or all MGS vehicles to support each of \nthe infantry platoons. The unit can post guides at these critical locations to ensure maintaining control over \nthe movement ( FM 3-90 -1). \nINTE\nLLIGENCE  \n2-188. The commander needs to have detailed knowledge of the enemy’s organiza tion, equipment, and \ntactics to employ his capabilities and tactics. The commander needs to understand the enemy’s strengths \nand weaknesses. The COIST aids the commander with these tasks. \n2-189. The commander cannot conduct a deliberate attack if he does not have good intelligence and, \ntherefore, does not know where most of the enemy’s units and systems are located. The attacking unit can \nconduct a movement to contact, a hasty attack, or conduct additional information collection .  \nFIRES \n2-190. The planning process synchr onizes the unit’s maneuver with the provision of fire support. It \nidentifies critical times and places where the commander needs the maximum effects from fire-support \nassets and direct fire assets to include the MGS platoon and the company mortar section. The commander \ncombines maneuver with fires to mass effects, achieve surprise, destroy enemy forces, and obtain decisive \nresults.  \n2-191. Company commanders will often find themselves as the observer (and executor) of battalion fires. \nUnderstanding how to echelon fires is critical for the indirect fire plan to be effectively synchronized with \nthe maneuver plan. The purpose of echeloning fires is to maintain constant fires on a target while using the \noptimum delivery system to the point of its risk-estimate distance in combat operations or minimum safe \ndistance in training. Echeloning fires provides protection for friendly forces as they move to and assault an \nobjective, allowing them to close with minimal casualties. It prevents the enemy from observing and \nengaging the assault by forcing the enemy to take cover, allowing the friendly force to continue the \nadvance unimpeded. \nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-43 2-192. The commander’s attack criteria goal is to concentrate fires on seizing the initiative. The \ncommander emphasizes simple and rapidly integrated fire support plans. This is done using quick-fire \nplanning techniques and good SOPs. The commander integrates fire assets as far forward as possible in the \nmovement formation to facilitate early emplacement. Fires concentrate (mass) on forward enemy element s \nto enable maneuver efforts to close with the enemy positions.  \nSUSTAINMENT  \n2-193. Sustainment  is the provision of the logistics, personnel services, and health service support \nnecessary to maintain operations until successful mission completion (ADRP 4-0). The commander plans , \nalong with the XO and 1SG, to provide sustainment to ensure freedom of action, extend operational reach, \nand prolong endurance. The sustainment plan includes medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) and CASEVAC, \nvehicle recovery, and resupply during the execution and consolidation and reorganization phase of the \nattack. This plan must synchronize with the movement and maneuver so that actions taken in the event of a \ncasualty, loss of vehicle, or critical item do not compromise the mission or retask combat power. \nPROTECTION  \n2-194. Protection facilitates the commander’s ability to maintain the force’s integrity and combat power. \nIt determines the degree to which potential threats can disrupt operations and counters or mitigates those \nthreats. Emphasis on protection increases during preparation and continues throughout execution. \nProtection is a continuing activity; it integrates all protection capabilities to safeguard bases, secure routes, \nand protect forces. \nPREPARING AN ATTACK \n2-195. Attacks are best organized and coordinated in assembly areas. If the commander decides that rapid \naction is essential to retain a tactical advantage he may opt not to use an assembly area. Detailed advance \nplanning, combined with effective communications, SOP, and battle drills, reduces negative impacts of \nsuch a decision.  \n2-196. Unless already in an assembly area, the attacking unit moves into one during the preparation \nphase. The unit moves with as much secrecy as possible, normally at night, and along routes that prevent or \ndegrade the enemy’ s capabilities to visually observe or otherwise detect the movement. It avoids \ncongesting its assembly area and occupies it for the shortest length of time possible. Each unit is \nresponsible for its own security activities, such as local ground security, while in the assembly area.  \n2-197. The attacking unit should continue its TLPs and priorities of work to the extent the situation and \nmission allow before moving to attack positions. These preparations include, but are not necessarily limited \nto— \nProtecting the force.\nConducting task organization.\nPerforming reconnaissance.\nRefining the plan and updating mission data into mission command systems .\nBriefing the troops.\nConducting rehearsals, to include test firing of weapons.\nMoving sustainment and medical support forward.\nPromoting adequate rest for both leaders, and Soldiers.\nPositioning the force for subsequent action.\n2-198. Leaders at all levels should conduct a reconnaissance of the actual terrain when it will not \ncompromise operational security or result in excessive risk to the unit leadership as part of TLPs. Modern \ninformation systems and reconnaissance assets enable leaders to conduct a virtual reconnaissance when a \nphysical reconnaissance is not practical. If a limited-visibility attack is planned, they should reconnoiter the \nterrain at night ( FM 3-90-1).  \nChapter 2 \n2-44  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016REHEARSALS  \n2-199. The commander exercises and refines the maneuver, fire, and sustainment plans during rehearsals, \nwhich are an important part of ensuring the plan’s coordination and synchronization. As part of the \nrehearsal process, the commander reviews his decision points and the anticipated battle sequence with \nsubordinate leaders, ensuring all units understand the plan, the relationship between fire and movement, \nand the synchronization of critical events. These critical events include — \nActions on the objective.\nReconnaissance handover.\nMoving from the assembly area to the LD.\nManeuvering from the LD to the PLD, to include dismount points.\nOccupying support-by-fire positions.\nConducting the breach or gap crossing if applicable.\nConsolidating on the objective.\nExploiting success or pursuing a withdrawing enemy.\nActions of echelon reserves.\nResupply operations.\n2-200. The unit should conduct rehearsals under as many types of adverse conditions as possible, with \ntime and other restraints, to identify and prepare the unit to cope with problems. At lower tactical echelons, \nthe rehearsal includes battle drills, such as creating lanes through minefields, react to contact, loss of \ncommunications, CASEVAC, and so forth. \nEXECUTING AN ATTACK \n2-201. A series of advances and assaults by attacking units until they secure the final objective \ncharacterizes the attack. Commanders at all levels use their initiative to rapidly shift their main effort \nbetween units to take advantage of opport unities and momentum that ensure the enemy’s rapid destruction. \nAttacking units move as quickly as possible following reconnaissance elements or successful probes \nthrough gaps in the enemy’s defenses. They shift their strength to reinforce success and carr y the operation \ndeep into the enemy’s rear.  \n2-202. Stryker Infantry rifle companies conduct attacks after analyzing information about the enemy \nthrough reconnaissance, maneuvering to a dismount point, deploying its Infantry, and initiating contact \nwith enemy forces from a place of tactical advantage. \n2-203. The commander does not delay the attack to preserve the alignment of subordinate units or to \nadhere closely to the preconceived plan of attack. He avoids becoming so committed to the initial plan that \nopportunities are neglected. He is mentally prepared to abandon failed attacks and to exploit any \nunanticipated successes or enemy errors by designating another unit to conduct the decisive operation in \nresponse to the changing situation (FM 3-90-1).  \nGAIN AND MAINTAIN ENEMY CONTACT  \n2-204. Gaining and maintaining contact with the enemy when he is determined to break that contact is \nvital to the success of offensive tasks. A defending enemy establishes a security area around his forces to \nmake early contact with the attacking forces to determine their capabilities, intent, and chosen COA and to \ndelay their approach. The enemy commander wants to use his security area to strip away friendly \nreconnaissance forces and hide his dispositions, capabilities, and intent. His goal is to compel the attacking \nforce to conduct a movement to contact against his forces to determine the exact location of the attacking \nforces.  \n2-205. Stryker units gain and maintain contact through reconnaissance forward with sensors detecting the \nenemy and maneuvering to confirm or deny their presence. Information gained from reconnaissance is \nquickly shared through mission commands systems laterally and vertically throughout the SBCT to allow \nits combat units to maneuver and destroy the threat. \nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-45 DISRUPT THE ENEMY  \n2-206. Disrupting one or more parts of the enemy weakens his entire force and allows the friendly \ncommander to attack the remaining enemy force in piecemeal. The assessment and decisions regarding \nwhat to disrupt, when to disrupt, and to what end are critical.  \n2-207. Once any type of contact is made with the enemy, the commander wants to use the element of \nsurprise to conduct shaping operations that strike at the enemy and disrupt both the enemy’s combined \narms team and his ability to plan and control his forces. Once this disruption begins, it continues throughout \nthe attack.  \nFIX THE ENEMY  \n2-208. A primary purpose in fixing the enemy is to isolate the objective of the force conducting the \nechelons decisive operation to prevent the enemy from maneuvering to reinforce the unit targeted for \ndestruction. The commander limits the options available to his opponent. Fixing an enemy into a given \nposition or a COA and controlling his movements limit his options and reduce the amount of uncertainty in \nthe AO.  \n2-209. Fixing the enemy is done with the minimum amount of force. The commander allocates the bulk \nof his combat power to the force conducting his decisive operation, so fixing is, by necessity, shaping \noperations that illustrate economy of force as a principle of war. Therefore, the commander carefully \nconsiders which enemy elements to fix and target only those that can significantly affect the outcome of the \nfight.  \nMANEUVER  \n2-210. The commander maneuvers his forces to gain positional advantage so he can seize, retain, and \nexploit the initiative. He av oids the enemy’s defensive strength. He employs tactics that defeat the enemy \nby attacking through a point of relative weakness, such as a flank or the rear. The key to success is to strike \nhard and fast, overwhelm a portion of the enemy force, then quickly transition to the next objective or \nphase, thus maintaining the momentum of the attack without reducing the pressure. The commander \nconsiders the following to conduct maneuvers — \nMovement from the Line of Departure to the Probable Line of Deployment.\nActions at the Probable Line of Deployment, Assault Position, or Final Coordination Line.\nBreaching.\nActions on the Objective.\nFollow Through.\nMovement from the Line of Departure to the Probable Line of Deployment \n2-211. The unit transitions from troop movement to maneuver once it crosses the LD. It moves \naggressively and as quickly as the terrain and enemy situation allow. It moves forward using appropriate \nmovement techniques assisted by the fires of supporting units. Fire and movement are closely integrated \nand coordinated. Effective suppressive fires facilitate friendly movement, and friendly movement facilitates \nmore effective fires. Whenever possible, the attacking unit uses avenues of approach that avoid strong \nenemy defensive positions, takes advantage of all available cover and concealment, and places the unit on \nthe flanks and rear of the defending enemy. The unit uses obscurants to conceal its movement when cover \nand concealment are not available.  \nActions at the Probable Line of Deployment, Assault Position, or Final Coordination Line \n2-212. The attacking unit maintains the pace of its advance as it approaches its PLD. The attacking unit \nsplits into one or more assault and support forces once it reaches the PLD, if not previously completed. All \nforces supporting the assault force should be in their support-by-fire positions before the assault force \ncrosses the PLD. The commander synchronizes the occupation of these support-by -fire positions with the \nmaneuver of the supported attacking unit to limit the vulnerability of the forces occupying these positions. \nThe commander uses unit tactical SOPs, battle drills, prearranged signals, EAs, and TRPs to control the \nChapter 2 \n2-46  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  direct fires from these supporting positions. The commander employs restricted fire lines between \nconverging forces. \nBreaching \n2-213. Once the support force sets the conditions, the breach force reduces, clears, and marks the required \nnumber of lanes through the enemy’s tactical obstacles to support the maneuver of the assault force. The \ncommander identifies the conditions that allow the breach force to proceed to avoid confusion. From the \nPLD, the assault force maneuvers against or around the enemy to take advantage of the support force’s \nefforts to suppress the targeted enemy positions. Successful obstacle breaching depends on effectively \napplying the breaching fundamentals of suppress, obscure, secure, reduce, and assault (SOSRA). (See \nchapter 7 , section VIII, this publication for more information about breaching). \nActions on the Objective \n2-214. The effects of the overwhelming and simultaneous application of fire, movement, and shock \naction characterize the final assault. This violent assault destroys or defeats and drives the enemy from the \nobjective area. Small units conduct the final assault while operating under the control of the appropriate \nechelon CP.  \n2-215. The commander employs all fire support means to destroy and suppress the enemy and sustain the \nmomentum of the attack. The commander improves the likelihood of success by carefully synchronizing \nthe effects of indirect-fire systems and available CAS. Fires are planned in series or groups to support \nmaneuver against enemy forces on or near the geographical objective. The assault element moves rapidly \nacross the objective as the commander shifts artillery fires and obscurants from the objective to other \ntargets. The support element does not allow its suppressive fires to lapse. These fires isolate the objective \nand prevent the enemy from reinforcing or counterattacking. They destroy escaping enemy forces and \nsystems ( FM 3-90-1).  \nFollow Through \n2-216. The commander has two alternatives after seizing the objective —exploit success and continue the \nattack or terminate the offensive task. The most likely on-order mission is to continue the attack after \nseizing the objective. The commander continues TLP in preparation for any on-order missions assigned by \na higher headquarters during consolidation. \n2-217. Upon termination of the attack, the commander consolidates and reorganizes. He establishes a \nhasty defense on the limit of advance off the objective area with the assaulting force. The supporting \nelements of the attack follow the assaulting elements path to link up with the remainder of the company. \nOnce consolidated, the commander searches the objective for any enemy forces, captured equipment, \nprisoners, or anything that may provide valuable intelligence, if the tactical situation allows. \nSimultaneously, the company conducts accountability of personnel, recovery of equipment, and cross levels \nammunition. Resupply and maintenance are follow-on tasks established in the priorities of work \ndetermined by the commander and based on METT-TC . \nSPECIAL-PURPOSE ATTACKS \n2-218. Special purpose attacks are ambush, counterattack, demonstration, feint, raid, and spoiling attack \n(FM 3-90-1 ). The commander’s intent and t he mission variables of METT-TC determine which special \npurpose attack(s) to employ. Each attack can be conducted as either a hasty or deliberate attack. The \ncommander’s intent and METT -TC mission variables and factors determine the specific attack form. A s \nsubordinate attack tasks, they share many of the planning, preparation, and execution considerations of the \nattack. Demonstrations and feints, while forms of attack, are associated with military deception operations \n(FM 3-13). \nAMBUSH  \n2-219. An ambush is an attack by fire, or other destructive means, from concealed positions on a moving \nor temporarily halted enemy. An ambush stops, denies, or destroys enemy forces by maximizing the \nelement of surprise. Ambushes can employ direct fire systems and other destructive means, such as \nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-47 command-detonated mines, indirect fires, and supporting nonlethal effects. They include an assault to close \nwith and destroy enemy forces. In an ambush, ground objectives do not have to be seized and held.  \n2-220. The three types of ambush are —point ambush, area ambush, and antiarmor ambush. In a point \nambush, a unit deploys to attack a single kill zone. In an area ambush, a unit deploys into two or more \nrelated point ambushes. Units smaller than a platoon do not usually conduct an area ambush.  \n2-221. A typical ambush consists of three elements —assault, support, and security. The assault element \nfires into the kill and clears zone. Its goal is to destroy the enemy force. It may be assigned additional tasks , \nsuch as — \nSearching for items of intelligence value.\nCapturing prisoners.\nPhotographing new types of equipment .\nWhen unable to take enemy equipment, completing the destruction of said equipment to avoid\nits immediate reuse.\n2-222. The support element supports the assault element by firing into and around the kill zone, and \nprovides the ambush’s primary killing power. The support element attempts to destroy most of the enemy \ncombat power before the assault element moves into the objective or kill zone. The security element \nisolates the kill zone, provides early warning of the arrival of any enemy relief force, and provides security \nfor the assault and support elements. It secures the objective rally point and blocks enemy avenues of \napproach into and out of the ambush site, which prevents the enemy from entering or leaving.  \nCOUNTERATTACK  \n2-223. A counterattack is an attack by part or all of a defending force against an enemy attacking force. \nUnits conduct counterattacks to seize the initiative from the enemy through offensive action (for example, \nregaining lost ground, or cutting off or destroying enemy advance units). The objective of counterattack is \nto deny the enemy his goal when attacking. The commander usually directs a counterattack from a \ndefensive posture —to defeat or destroy enemy forces, exploit an enemy weakness, such as an exposed \nflank, or to regain control of terrain and facilities after an enemy success. A counterattacking force \nmaneuvers to isolate and destroy a designated enemy force. It can attack by fire into an EA to defeat or \ndestroy an enemy force, restore the original position, or block an enemy penetration. Once launched, the \ncounterattack becomes a decisive operation for the commander conducting the counterattack. \n2-224. To be decisive, the counterattack occurs when the enemy is overextended, dispersed, and \ndisorganized during his attack. All counterattacks should be rehearsed under the same conditions in which \nthey will actually be conducted. Careful consideration is given to the event that will trigger the \ncounterattack. Once committed, the counterattack force conducts the decisive operation. \n2-225. SBCT’s conduct counter attacks assisted with the use of mission command systems and maneuver \nto a point of tactical advantage to initiate the attack with the enemy forces. They take advantage of the \nspeed and protection of their vehicles to deploy and initiate their attacks. \nDEMONSTRATIONS  \n2-226. A demonstration  is a form of attack designed to deceive the enemy as to the location or time of the \ndecisive operation by a display of force. Forces conducting a demonstration do not seek contact with the \nenemy as intended. \nFEINTS  \n2-227. A feint is a limited attack used to deceive the enemy as to the location or time of the actual \ndecisive operation. Forces conducting a feint seek direct fire contact with the enemy, but avoid decisive \nengagement. As in the demonstration, the commander uses feints in conjunction with other military \ndeception activities. \nRAID \n2-228. A raid is a limited-objective, deliberate attack that entails swift penetration of hostile terrain. It is \nnot intended to hold territory and has to have a planned withdrawal. A raid requires detailed intelligence, \nChapter 2 \n2-48  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016preparation, and planning. The SBCT Infantry rifle company conducts raids as part of a larger force to \naccomplish a number of missions, to include the following: \nCapture prisoners, installations, or enemy materiel.\nCapture or destroy specific enemy mission command locations.\nDestroy enemy materiel or installations.\nObtain intelligence concerning enemy locations, dispositions, strength, intentions, or methods\nof operation.\nConfuse the enemy or disrupt his plans.\nLiberate friendly personnel.\nSPOILING ATTACK  \n2-229. A spoiling attack is a tactical maneuver employed to seriously impair a hostile attack while the \nenemy is in the process of forming or assembling for an attack. A spoiling attack usually employs armored , \nattack helicopter, or fire support elements to attack on enemy assembly positions in front of a main line of \nresistance or battle position ( FM 3-90-1).  \n2-230. The objective of a spoiling attack is to disrupt the enemy’s offensive capabilities and timelines \nwhile destroying targeted enemy personnel and equipment, not to secure terrain and other physical \nobjectives. Conditions when conducting spoiling attack are: \nThe spoiling attack’s objective needs to be obtainable. The enemy should be unable to\nrespond to the attack in a synchronized and coordinated manner.\nThe commander prevents the force conducting the spoiling attack from becoming over\nextended.\nSECTION IV – TRANSITIONS \n2-231. The commander halts an offensive task when it results in complete victory and ends hostilities, \nreaches a culminating point, or the commander receives a change in mission from a higher commander. \nThis change in mission may be a result of the interrelationship of the other elements of national power, \nsuch as a political decision. \nCONSOLIDATION \n2-232. Consolidation is organizing and strengthening a newly captured position so that it can be \ndefended. The attacking unit tries to exploit its success regardless of the assault type. In some situations, \nhowever, the unit may have to consolidate its gains. Consolidation may vary from a rapid repositioning of \nforces and security elements on the objective, to a reorganization of the attacking force, to the organization \nand detailed improvement of the position for defense.  \n2-233. Consolidation comprise s actions taken to secure the objective and defend against an enemy \ncounterattack. Consideration should be given that the enemy that occupied the objective may have planned \nindirect fire targets to assist in their counterattack. The commander ensures that the SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany is ready to conduct the following actions that usually are part of consolidation: \nEliminate enemy resistance on the objective.\nEstablish security beyond the objective by securing areas that may be the source of enemy\ndirect fires or enemy artillery observation.\nEstablish additional security measures such as OPs and patrols.\nPrepare for and assist the passage of follow-on forces (if required).\nContinue to improve security by conducting defensive actions. These defensive actions\ninclude EA development, direct fire planning, and battle position preparation.\nAdjust FPF and register targets along likely mounted and dismounted avenues of approach.\nProtect the obstacle reduction effort.\nSecure EPWs and detainees.\nPrepare for the enemy counterattack.\nOffense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 2-49 REORGANIZATION  \n2-234. Reorganization is usually conducted concurrently with consolidation. It comprises actions taken to \nprepare the SBCT Infantry rifle company for follow-on missions. As with consolidation, the SBCT Infantry \nrifle company commander plans and prepares for reorganization as he conducts his TLPs. He ensures that \nthe SBCT Infantry rifle company take the following actions: \nProvide essential medical treatment and evacuate casualties, as needed.\nTreat and evacuate wounded EPWs and detainees, and process the remainder of EPWs and\ndetainees.\nCross-level personnel and adjust task organization when necessary to support the next phase\nor mission.\nConducts resupply operations, to include rearming and refueling.\nRedistribute ammunition.\nConduct required maintenance.\nContinue improvement of defensive positions, as needed.\nCONTINUING OPERATIONS \n2-235. For all attacks, the SBCT Infantry rifle company should plan to exploit success. However, at the \nconclusion of an engagement, the commander may be forced to defend. Units make use of the terrain to \nenhance their survivability for short defensive tasks. If a longer defense is envisioned, engineer assets \nimmediately should shift the priority of their efforts to provide survivability support (fighting positions and \nsimilar activities). Engineer assets should do this even as they sustain mobility and integrate \ncountermobility into the planned defense. The SBCT Infantry rifle company commander considers the \nhigher commander’s concept of operations, friendly capabilities, and the enemy situation when making the \ndecision to defend or continue offensive tasks. \nTRANSITION TO DEFENSIVE TASKS  \n2-236. As offensive tasks approach a culmination, the commander orders a transition to a defense. The \ncommander uses two basic techniques when he transitions to the defense. The first technique requires the \nleading elements to commit forces and push forward to claim enough ground to establish a security area \nanchored on defensible terrain. The second technique is to establish a security area along the unit’s final \npositions, moving the main body rearward to defensible terrain. \n2-237. The commander anticipating the termination of unit offensive actions prepares orders that include \nthe time or circumstances under which the offense transitions to a defensive-focused mission, the missions \nand locations of subordinate units, and mission command measures. The commander takes the following \nactions as the unit transitions from an offensive to a defensive task: \nMaintains contact and information collection on the enemy using a combination of\nreconnaissance units and surveillance assets to develop the situation and facilitate planning of\nfuture operations.\nEstablishes a security area and local security measures (to include biometric identity data\ncollection) .\nRedeploys indirect fire assets to ensure the support of security forces.\nRedeploys forces based on probable future employment.\nMaintains or regains contact with adjacent units in a contiguous AO and ensures that units\nremain capable of mutual support in a noncontiguous AO.\nTransitions the engineer effort by shifting the emphasis from mobility to countermobility and\nsurvivability.\nConsolidates and reorganizes.\nTRANSITION TO STABILITY TASKS  \n2-238. Upon order from higher headquarters, the commander orders a transition to operations focused on \nstability tasks. These tasks establish a safe, secure environment that facilitates reconciliation between local \nChapter 2 \n2-50  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016or regional threats. Stability tasks aim to establish conditions that support the transition to legitimate HN \ngovernance, a functioning civil society, and a viable market econom y. \n2-239. The SBCT Infantry rifle company commander ensures that contingencies are planned for to \ntransition quickly from offensive to stability tasks and vice versa. For example, it may be wise for \ncommanders to plan a defensive contingency with an on-order offensive mission for stability tasks that \ncould deteriorate. \n2-240. Subordinate leaders need to be fully trained to recognize activities that would initiate this \ntransition. Actions in one unit’s AO can affect a change in whatever type task an adjacent unit is \nconducting. (For example, an offensive action may cause noncombatants to be displaced to another section \nof the city creating a need to support operation for the unit in that AO.)  \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 3-1 Chapter 3 \nDefense \nA defensive task  is a task conducted to defeat an enemy attack, gain time, economize \nforces, and develop conditions favorable for offensive or stability tasks (ADRP 3-0) . \nThe SBCT Infantry rifle company uses the defense to occupy and prepare positions \nand mass the effects of direct fires on likely approaches. The commander combines \nnatural and man-made obstacles to canalize the attacking force into engagement \nareas. This chapter discusses the basics of the defense, defense of a linear object, \nperimeter defense, reverse slope defense, engagement area development, and \ntransitions. \nSECTION I – BASICS OF THE DEFENSE \n3-1. As part of the higher echelon’s defensive tasks, the SBCT Infantry rifle company may defend, delay, \nwithdraw, or counterattack. It may also perform security tasks for the SBCT Infantry Battalion. The SBCT \nInfantry rifle company may defend as part of the higher headquarters’ main battle area, or it may conduct \nautonomous defensive or stability tasks within a small scale contingency. The SBCTs Infantry rifle \ncompany and its higher headquarters conduct operations to create conditions for success as enemy forces \nenter into the main battle area and by weakening the enemy prior to the commencement to close combat. \n3-2. The SBCT Infantry rifle company usually defends in the main battle area. The SBCT Infantry \nbattalion can conduct the defense to achieve one or more of the following actions: \nGain time.\nRetain key terrain.\nSupport other missions.\nPreoccupy the enemy in one area while friendly forces attack him in another.\nAttrite enemy forces at a rapid rate while reinforcing friendly actions.\nCHARACTERISTICS OF DEFENSE \n3-3. Successful defenses employ the characteristics of disruption, flexibility, maneuver, mass and \nconcentration, operations in depth, preparation, and security.  \nDISRUPTION  \n3-4. Defenders subvert an attacker’s tempo, formations and synchronization by countering his initiative \nand preventing him from massing overwhelming combat power. Disruption attacks the enemy’s will to \nfight and his means of effective command and control. Deep precision fires, long-range precision sniper \nfires, electronic countermeasures (jamming), scatterable minefields (SCATMINE), unexpected defensive \npositions, local counterattacks at all levels, and attacks delivered by a reserve force, combine to disrupt the \nenemy’s attack and break his will to continue offensive operations. Repositioning forces, implement \naggressive protection measures, the employment of roadblocks, ambushes, checkpoints, and information \noperations combine to disrupt the threat of asymmetrical attack. These tasks disrupt enemy efforts to fight \nas a combined-arms team.  \nFLEXIBILITY  \n3-5. The defender gains flexibility by sound preparation and task organization, disposition in depth, \nretention of reserves, repositioning, and effective mission command. The defense is characterized by rapid, \nChapter 3 \n3-2  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016simultaneous, and collaborative planning with flexible execution. Contingency planning permits flexibility. \nFlexibility also requires that the commander see the battlefield to detect the enemy ’s scheme of maneuver \nearly. Intelligence preparation of the battlefield determines likely enemy actions; while security elements \nconfirm or deny those actions.  \nMOVEMENT AND MANEUVER  \n3-6. Maneuver allows the commander to take full advantage of the AO and mass and concentrate fires \nwhen desirable. Maneuver through movement in combination with fire, allows the commander to achieve a \nposition of advantage over the enemy to accomplish the mission. It encompasses defensive actions such as \nsecurity and support operations. \nMASSING EFFECTS  \n3-7. The company shapes and decides the battle by massing the effects of overwhelming combat power. \nEffects are synchronized in time and space and should be rapid and unexpected so that they break the \nenemy’s offensive tempo and disrupt hi s attack. The company commander deploys his arrays his combat \npower based on his assessment of the intelligence provided and the latest information from reconnaissance \nin a manner that overwhelms the enemy and provides the greatest impact on their forces while negating the \nrisks to his own units. This can occur at a single decisive point or through multiple incursions in depth to \nachieve disruptive, destructive, and decisive effects upon the enemy’s attack.  \nOPERATIONS IN DEPTH  \n3-8. Integration of all combat power throughout the area of operation improves the chances for success \nwhile minimizing friendly casualties. Quick, violent, and simultaneous action throughout the depth of the \ncompanies’  area of operations can attrite, confuse, and even degrade an enemy force when he is most \nexposed and vulnerable. Such actions weaken the enemy’s morale and do not allow any early successes to \nbuild their confidence. Operations in depth prevent the enemy from gaining momentum in the attack. \nSynchronization of actions in deep, close, and security areas facilitate mission success.  \n3-9. Alternate and supplementary positions, combat outposts, and mutually supporting strongpoint’s \nforward of the perimeter extend the depth. Fires are planned throughout the defensive area up to the \nmaximum range of available weapons and reconnaissance assets. Fires move and reposition to maintain \ncontact with enemy forces and observe NAIs in depth as the battle develops. During periods of reduced \nvisibility, obstacles are emplaced around critical locations within the perimeter to disrupt the enemy’s plan, \nand add depth to the defense.  \nPREPARATION  \n3-10. The company commander determines likely enemy avenues of approach, likely enemy schemes of \nmaneuver, where to kill the enemy, integration of obstacles, unit positioning, and integration of indirect \nfires, and he assigns missions accordingly. Defensive preparations include the following:  \nEnact survivability measures that involve action against conventional threats (preparation of\nfighting positions, digging-in mission command nodes, and similar actions) as well as\nasymmetric threats (terrorist attacks and weapons of mass destruction employment).\nDesignate a reserve.\nConduct rehearsals to ensure synchronization. These include employment of the reserve and\ncounterattack forces.\nPosition forces in depth.\nReinforce terrain with obstacles that support the scheme of maneuver.\nCoordinate with assets forward in the battalion’s security area to gain combat information or\nearly warning.\nSECURITY  \n3-11. Security operations are measures normally taken by the SBCT Infantry battalion or higher echelons \nto protect itself against all acts designed to impair its effectiveness, and prevent the enemy from gaining an \nunexpected advantage. Because the SBCT Infantry rifle company defends to conserve combat power for \nDefense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 3-3 use elsewhere or later, commanders must secure the force. The battalion ensures security by employing \nreconnaissance elements throughout the entirety of its assigned AO. The battalion may employ a \ncounterreconnaissance force, combat outposts, or a force conducting a screen to provide security. This \nforce may be its Scout platoon but can be one of its companies or elements of its companies depending on \nthe level of security the battalion determines suitable to the threat.  \n3-12. Information operations capabilities such as psychological operations, military deception, and \nelectronic warfare (EW) can aid in securing the force and confuse the enemy as to the battalion’s manner of \ndefense. The battalion integrates its security operations with those of the SBCT and other adjacent or \npartnered units. \nDEFENSIVE TASKS \n3-13. There are three basic defensive tasks —area defense, mobile defense, and retrograde. Each of these \ntasks contains elements of the others, and usually contains both static and dynamic aspects. SBCT Infantry \nrifle companies serve as the primary maneuver elements, or terrain controlling units, for the SBCT Infantry \nbattalion in all three defensive tasks. They can defend AOs or positions, or they can serve as security forces \nor reserves as part of the SBCT Infantry battalions coordinated defense. (Refer to ADRP 3-90 for more \ninformation.)  \n3-14. As part of defensive tasks, the SBCT Infantry rifle company can defend, delay, withdraw, \ncounterattack, and perform security tasks. The SBCT Infantry rifle company usually defends, as part of the \nSBCT Infantry battalion’s defense, in the main battle area (MBA). The SBCT Infantry rifle company can \nconduct the defense to achieve one or more of the following actions: \nGain time.\nRetain key terrain.\nSupport other missions.\nPreoccupy the enemy in one area while friendly forces attack him in another.\nAttrite enemy forces at a rapid rate while reinforcing friendly actions.\nAREA DEFENSE  \n3-15. The area defense  is a defensive task that denies enemy forces access to designated terrain for a \nspecific time rather than destroying the enemy outright (ADRP 3-90). The emphasis is on retaining terrain \nwhere the bulk of the defending force positions itself in mutually supporting positions and controlling the \nterrain between positions. The defeat mechanism is fires into EAs, which reserve units can supplement. The \ncommander uses his reserve force to reinforce fires, add depth, block penetrations, restore positions, or \ncounterattack to destroy enemy forces and seize the initiative.  \nForms of Defensive Maneuver \n3-16. There are two forms of defensive maneuver within an area defense —defense in depth and forward \ndefense. The SBCT Infantry rifle company is expected to do both. While the SBCT Infantry battalion \ncommander selects the type of area defense to use, the company commander often defines the general \ndefensive scheme for the company. The specific mission may impose constraints such as time, security, and \nretention of certain areas that are significant factors in determining how the company will defend. \nDefense in Depth \n3-17. A defense in depth reduces the risk of the attacking enemy force penetrating the defense quickly. The \nenemy is unable to exploit a penetration because of additional defensive positions employed in depth. The \nin-depth defense provides more space and time to defeat the enemy attack. \n3-18. The SBCT Infantry rifle company uses a defense in depth when — \nThe mission allows the SBCT Infantry rifle company to fight throughout the depth of the AO.\nThe terrain does not favor a defense well forward, and there is better defensible terrain deeper in\nthe AO.\nSufficient depth is available in the AO.\nChapter 3 \n3-4  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  Cover and concealment forward in the AO is limited.\nWeapons of mass destruction may be used.\nForward Defense \n3-19. The intent of a forward defense is to prevent enemy penetration of the defense. A forward defense is \nthe least preferred due to its lack of depth. The SBCT Infantry rifle company deploys most of its combat \npower into forward defensive positions near the forward edge of the battle area (FEBA). While the SBCT \nInfantry battalion may lack depth, the rifle company and platoons build depth into the defense at their \nlevels. The commander fights to retain its forward position, and may conduct counterattacks against enemy \npenetrations, or to destroy enemy forces in forward EAs. Often, counterattacks are planned forward of the \nFEBA to defeat the enemy. \n3-20. The SBCT Infantry rifle company uses a forward defense when — \nTerrain forward in the AO favors the defense.\nStrong natural or man-made obstacles, such as a river or a rail line, are located forward in the\nAO.\nThe assigned AO lacks depth due to the location of the area or facility to be protected. Cover\nand concealment in the rear portion of the AO is limited.\nDirected by higher headquarters to retain or initially control forward terrain.\nMobile Defense \n3-21. The mobile defense is a defensive task that concentrates on the destruction or defeat of the enemy \nthrough a decisive attack by a striking force (ADRP 3-90). The mobile defense focuses on defeating or \ndestroying the enemy by allowing enemy forces to advance to a point where they are exposed to a decisive \ncounterattack by the striking force. The commander uses the fixing force to hold attacking enemy forces in \nposition, to help channel attacking enemy forces into ambush areas, and to retain areas from which to \nlaunch the striking force. A mobile defense requires an AO of considerable depth. \n3-22. The SBCT Infantry rifle c ompany’s mission in a mobile defense is either part of a fixing force or a \nstriking force, but not both. As part of the fixing force, the SBCT Infantry rifle company defends within its \nassigned AO. As part of the striking force, the SBCT Infantry company plans, rehearses, and executes \noffensive tasks.  \nNote.  Units smaller than a division do not usually conduct a mobile defense because of their \ninability to fight multiple engagements throughout the width, depth, and height of their AO, \nwhile simultaneously resourcing the striking, fixing, and reserve forces. Typically, the striking \nforce in a mobile defense consists of one-half to two- thirds of the defender’s combat power.  \n3-23. The striking force is a committed force and has the resources to conduct a decisive counterattack as a \npart of the mobile defense. The striking force decisively engages the enemy as he becomes exposed in his \nattempts to overcome the fixing force. The striking force normally attacks a moving enemy force, and is \nusually armor heavy. \nRetrograde \n3-24. The retrograde  is a type of defense task that involves organized movement away from the enemy \n(ADRP 3-90). The enemy may force these actions or the commander may execute them voluntarily. In \neither case, the higher commander of the force executing the operation approves the retrograde. Retrograde \nis conducted to improve a tactical situation or to prevent a worse situation from developing. Companies \nusually conduct retrogrades as part of a larger force, but may conduct independent retrogrades when \nnecessary such as on a raid.  \n3-25. Retrograde can accomplish the following: \nResist, exhaust, and defeat enemy forces.\nDraw the enemy into an unfavorable situation.\nAvoid contact in undesirable conditions.\nDefense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 3-5 Gain time.\nSecure more favorable terrain\nReposition forces, shorten lines of communication, or conform to movements of other friendly\nunits.\nDisengage a force from an ongoing mission for use elsewhere in other missions.\n3-26. Disengage is a tactical mission task where the commander has the unit break contact with the enemy \nto allow the conduct of another mission or to avoid decisive engagement ( FM 3-90-1). It involves moving \nt\no a location where the enemy cannot engage the friendly force with either direct fires or observed indirec t \nfires. Disengaging from the enemy while displacing from one position to the next is a difficult procedure. A \ndisengagement plan includes the following :  \nThe maneuver concept of operations for tactical elements after disengagement, along with the\nmovement routes for each subordinate unit.\nFires to suppress the enemy and cover the unit’s movement.\nScreening smoke to conceal the unit’s movement, as part of a deception operation, or to cover\npassage points.\nContact and passage points if moving through friendly lines.\nThe time disengagement starts.\nThe earliest time that functional and multifunctional support and sustainment elements move.\n3-27. There are three types of retrograde — \nDelay.\nWithdrawal.\nRetirement.\nDelay \n3-28. Delay is a task that allows the unit to trade space for time, avoiding decisive engagement and \nsafeguarding its elements. Delays gain time to — \nAllow other friendly forces to establish a defense.\nCover a withdrawing force.\nProtect a friendly force’s flank.\nAllow other forces to counterattack.\n3-29. The SBCT Infantry rifle company conducts delays by initiating and breaking contact with enemy \nforces with their Infantry to prevent from being decisively engaged. This technique forces the enemy to \ndeploy, and then reorganize to continue operations forcing them to use time to accomplish these tasks. The \nInfantry keeps the Stryker vehicle in close proximity but out of direct fire contact during the engagement. \nRemounting the vehicle under direct fire should only be done if the enemy force can be suppressed with \nfires. Remounting the vehicle is preferred to be done out of contact. The MGS platoon, Mortar section can \nall assist the dismounted element break contact by means of direct and indirect fires. \nWithdrawal \n3-30. Withdrawal  is a task that the commander uses to break enemy contact, especially when he needs to \nfree the unit for a new mission. There are two types of withdrawals, assisted, and unassisted. The \ncommander’s intent and METT -TC determine which type of withdrawal the unit uses. \nAssisted Withdrawal \n3-31. The assisting force occupies positions to the rear of the withdrawing unit and prepares to accept \ncontrol of the situation. It can assist the withdrawing unit with route reconnaissance, route maintenance, \ndirect and indirect fire support, and sustainment. Both forces closely coordinate the withdrawal. \nUnassisted Withdrawal \n3-32. The withdrawing unit establishes routes and develops plans for the withdrawal, then establishes \nsecurity force as the rear guard while the main body withdraws. Sustainment and protection elements \nChapter 3 \n3-6  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016usually withdraw first, followed by combat forces. The DLIC disengages from the enemy and follows the \nmain body to its final destination as the unit withdraws. \nRetirement \n3-33. Retirement is a task that moves a force that is not in contact away from the enemy. A retiring unit \norganizes for combat but does not anticipate interference by enemy ground forces. Typically, another unit’s \nsecurity force covers the movement of one formation as the unit conducts a retirement. However, mobile \nenemy forces, unconventional forces, air strikes, air assaults, or long-range fires may attempt to interdict \nthe retiring unit. The commander plans for enemy actions and organizes the unit to fight in self-defense. \nThe commander usually conducts a retirement to reposition his forces for future actions or to accommodate \nthe concept of the operation. Units conduct retirements as tactical road marches where security and speed \nare the most important considerations.  \nFORMS OF THE DEFENSE \n3-34. The three forms of the defense (defense of a linear obstacle, perimeter defense, and reverse-slope \ndefense) have special purposes and require special planning and execution. The three forms of the defense \nprovide distinct advantages for the defender and its subordinate units and apply to the area defense and the \noperations of the fixing force during a mobile defense. (Refer to FM 3-90-1 for additional information.)  \nDEFENSE OF A LINEAR OBSTACLE  \n3-35. A defense of a linear obstacle generally favors the use of a forward defense. Maintaining the integrity \nof the linear obstacle is the key to this type of defense. The defending unit constructs obstacles to stop the \nenemy forces and channel them into planned engagement areas. When attacked, the defending force \nisolates the enemy, conducts counterattacks, and delivers fires onto the concentrated force to defeat \nattempts to breach the obstacle.   \n3-36. Defense of a linear obstacle often is used as part of an economy of force measure. Forces that can \ncounterattack and destroy the enemy may not be available immediately; therefore, defending forces must be \nable to —   \nDetect enemy penetrations early enough so that local counterattacks can defeat them.\nDefend after being isolated.\nUse reconnaissance elements, sniper teams, and other elements to detect enemy forces and call in\nfires.\nBring the fight to the enemy side of the obstacle to destroy its forces and disrupt enemy\npreparations.\nUse fires to their maximum effect.\nUse its mobility to concentrate combat power.\nPERIMETER DEFENSE  \n3-37. A perimeter defense is a defense oriented in all directions The SBCT Infantry rifle company often \nuse a perimeter defense when conducting operations in noncontiguous areas of operations. The perimeter \ndefense presents no assailable flanks to the enemy and allows the defender to reinforce a threatened area \nrapidly. Some disadvantages of a perimeter defense include its isolation and the vulnerability of its \nconcentrated units to enemy fires.  \n3-38. The commander establishes a perimeter defense when the unit must hold critical terrain, such as a \nstrong point, or when it must defend itself in areas where the defense is not tied in with adjacent units. \nUnits can organize a perimeter defense to accomplish a specific mission, such as protecting a base or \nproviding immediate self-protection, such as during resupply operations when all-around security is \nrequired. During a perimeter defense, leaders at all levels ensure that —   \nUnits physically tie into each other.\nDirect fire weapons use flanking fire to protect the perimeter.\nField artillery and mortars are protected.\nDefense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 3-7 PACE Communications systems are secure and redundant.\nObstacles are employed.\nFinal protective fires are established.\nREVERSE -SLOPE DEFENSE  \n3-39. An alternative to defending on the forward slope of a hill is to defend on a reverse slope. The \nreverse-slope defense allows units to concentrate their direct fires into a relatively small area while being \nprotected from the enemy’s direct observation and supporting fires. The defender can destroy the enemy’s \nisolated forward units through surprise and concentrated fires. The control of the forward slope is essential \nfor success. Gaining control of the forward slope can be done by using dominating terrain behind the \ndefenders or with the use of stay behind forces, such as reconnaissance and sniper teams, that can observe \nand call in fires on the attackers. \nCOMMON DEFENSIVE PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS \n3-40. Planning a defense is a complex effort requiring detailed planning and extensive coordination. In the \ndefense, synchronizing the SBCT Infantry rifle company’s combat and supporting systems enables the \ncommander to apply combat power against selected advancing enemy forces to unhinge the enemy \ncommander’s plan and destroy his combined arms team. As a mission evolves, the commander knows he \nmay need to shift his decisive and shaping operations to press the fight and keep the enemy off balance. \nThe synchronization and coordination of activities within each warfighting function and between the \nvarious warfighting functions are critical to the success of the SBCT Infantry rifle company.  \nMISSION COMMAND  \n3-41. The company commander describes his anticipated enemy actions integrated with the SBCT Infantry \nbattalions IPB. The company level IPB and the SBCT Infantry battalion IPB should not differ significantly. \nThe SBCT Infantry battalions IPB should give the SBCT Infantry rifle company commander a clear \nunderstanding of how the SBCT Infantry battalion commander envisions the enemy will fight, and the \nenemy’s plan for the operation. The SBCT battalion commander and the BCT commander usually define \nwhere and how they will defeat or destroy the enemy. The company commander refines where he will \nintegrate the other warfighting functions into a coherent whole to mass the effects of combat power at the \ndecisive place and time. (Refer to ADRP 6-0 for more information on mission command.) The company \ncommander defines how he envisions the SBCT rifle company will execute its portion of the brigade fight \nbased off of the commander’s intent one and two levels up.  \nMOVEMENT AND MANEUVER  \n3-42. Effective weapons positioning is critical to the SBCT Infantry rifle company ’s success in the \ndefense. Company leadership should take advantage of the .50 cal and MK-19 on the RWS by placing them \nin positions that do not expose the hull of the Stryker vehicle but allow them to engage the enemy. Stryker \nInfantry squads should deploy their javelins from covered and concealed positions at maximum effective \nranges away from their ICVs to reduce armored vehicles ability to detect them. These positions are \nnormally forward of the ICV offset to the left or the right of the RWS’s orientation towards a TRP to avoid \nthe ICV’s surface danger zone ( SDZ). Effective weapons positioning enables the SBCT rifle company to \nmass fires at critical points in the AO and shift fires as needed. The SBCT Infantry rifle company \ncommander exploits the strengths of his weapons systems while minimizing the company ’s exposure to \nenemy observation and fires. \n3-43. The company leadership should integrate ICVs and Infantry to support one another in the defense. \nThe Infantry should provide additional security in the defense from a mutually supporting position as well \nas local security. The ICVs should support the Infantry with use of it crew served weapons, ability to \nreposition forces quickly to alternate and subsequent positions, provide information updates and situational \nawareness with mission command systems, conduct emergency resupply, and CASEVAC. \n3-44. When the commander designates a reserve he positions the reserve in a location where it can \neffectively react to several contingency plans. He considers terrain, trafficability of roads, potential EAs, \nprobable points of enemy penetrations, and commitment time. The reserve should be positioned in a \nChapter 3 \n3-8  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016covered and concealed position. Information concerning the reserve may be considered essential elements \nof friendly information (EEFI) and protected from enemy reconnaissance.  \nINTELLIGENCE  \n3-45. The SBCT Infantry rifle company commander will never have all the intelligence he needs about the \nenemy. Therefore, he with the COIST obtains or develops the best possible IPB products and conducts \ncontinuous information collection and integrates new and updated intelligence throughout the mission. He \nmay need to request intelligence from the battalion staff to answer PIR that is integrated into specific NAIs . \nThis allows the Stryker Infantry rifle company commander to decide where to place his information \ncollection effort. (Refer to ATP 2-01.3 for more information.) \n3-46. As with all tactical planning, IPB is a critical part of defensive planning. It helps the commander \ndefine where to concentrate combat power, where to accept prudent risk, and where to plan potential \ndecisive operations. The IPB presents all feasible enemy COAs to aid in the development of a flexible \ndefensive plan. The essential areas are — \nAnalyze terrain and weather.\nDetermine enemy force size and likely COAs with associated DPs.\nDetermine enemy vulnerabilities and HVTs.\nImpact of civilian population on the defense.\n3-47. The commander makes his determination of how and where to defeat the enemy on where he \nbelieves the enemy will go, the terrain, and the forces available. The SBCT Infantry battalion may define a \ndefeat mechanism that includes the use of single or multiple counterattacks to achieve success. The \ncompany commander analyzes his unit’s role in the SBCT Infantry battalion fight to determine how to \nachieve success.  \nFIRES \n3-48. For the fire support plan to be effective in the defense, the SBCT Infantry rifle company plans and \nexecutes fires in a manner that achieves the intended task and purpose of each target. Indirect fires serve a \nvariety of purposes in the defense, to include the following: \nSlow and disrupt enemy movement.\nPrevent the enemy from breaching.\nDestroy or delay enemy forces at obstacles using massed fires or precision munitions.\nDisrupt enemy support-by -fire elements.\nDefeat attacks along dismounted avenues of approach with the use of FPF.\nDisrupt the enemy to enable friendly elements to disengage or conduct counterattacks.\nObscure enemy observation or screen friendly movement during disengagement and\ncounterattacks.\nProvide smoke screens to separate enemy echelons or to silhouette enemy formations to\nfacilitate direct fire engagement.\nProvide illumination, as needed.\nExecute SEAD missions to support aviation missions.\n3-49. The SBCT Infantry rifle company commander evaluates the air integration plan with indirect fire \nsystems available to provide support when developing the fire plan. Considerations, when developing the \nplan, include tactical capabilities, weapon’s ranges, available munitions, time on station, communication \nand control, airspace management, and marking of enemy and friendly units. These factors help the SBCT \nInfantry rifle company commander and FSO determine the best method for achieving the task and purpose \nof each target in the fire plan. The rifle company’s fire support personnel contribut e significantly to the \nfight. Effective positioning is critical. The company commander and company FSO selects positions that \nprovide fire support personnel with unobstructed observation of the AO and ensures survivability. They \nadjust indirect fires onto the targets, synchronize effects, assist to clear airspace and guide aircraft onto \ntargets.  \nDefense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 3-9 SUSTAINMENT  \n3-50. Besides the sustainment functions required for all missions, the SBCT Infantry rifle company \ncommander ’s planning process includes pre-positioning of ammunition caches, positioning of SBCT rifle \ncompany trains, and Class IV and V supply points and mine dumps, vehicle recovery and maintenance, and \nMEDEVAC and CASEVAC. \n3-51. The commander ’s mission analysis may reveal that the company ’s ammunition requirements during \nan upcoming mission exceed its basic load. This requires the company to preposition ammunition caches. \nThe company usually positions ammunition caches at alternate or subsequent positions. The company may \nconstruct survivability positions to house these caches and guard them to prevent their capture or \ndestruction by the enemy. \n3-52. The SBCT Infantry rifle company train usually operates 500 to 1000 meters, or one terrain feature, to \nthe rear of the company to provide immediate recovery and medical support. The company trains conduct \nevacuation (of those wounded in action [WIA], weapons, and equipment) and resupply as required. The \ncompany trains are located in covered and concealed positions close enough to the company to provide \nresponsive support, but out of enemy direct fire range. The 1SG or XO positions the trains and supervises \nsustainment. The SBCT Infantry rifle company commander ensures all elements know the casualty \nevacuation procedures and the locations of the battalion combat and field trains and the company CCP  and \nbattalion aid station (BAS). The company commander ’s analysis determines the most effective measures \nfor every mission, which includes the decision to evacuate or recover forward and consolidate based on the \ntactical situation.  \nPROTECTION  \n3-53. Air and missile defense (AMD) support to the SBCT Infantry rifle company may be limited. Units \nshould hide from heavier enemy air threats such as rotary-wing, fixed-wing, or Class III Unmanned \nAircraft System (UAS) and use their organic weapons systems for self-defense against smaller enemy air \nthreats such as Class II and below UAS or lighter than air aircraft. They should plan for CBRN \nreconnaissance at likely locations for enemy employment of CBRN agents and hazards. They should use \nobscurants to support disengagement or movement of forces. They assign sectors of fire to prevent \nfratricide and friendly fire. \n3-54. Survivability construction includes fighting positions, protective positions, and hardening. These are \nprepared to protect vehicles, personnel, and weapons systems. Positions can be constructed and reinforced \nwith overhead cover to increase the survivability of dismounts and crew-served weapons against shrapnel \nfrom airbursts. Vehicle fighting positions can be constructed with hull down observation positions. The \nSBCT Infantry rifle company may use digging assets for ammunition caches at alternate, supplementary, or \nsubsequent positions. All leaders need to understand the survivability plan and priorities. Typically, the \nengineer platoon leader cr eates a commander’s card if supporting the company, which enables the \ncommander to track the survivability effort. One person in the company, usually the company XO or 1SG, \nis designated to enforce the plan and priorities, and to ensure that the completion status is accurately \nreported and tracked. \nADDITIONAL P LANNING CONSIDERATIONS  \n3-55. Additional defensive task planning considerations include missions in urban environment, mountain, \nand desert and jungle terrain as well as sniper employment. \nUrban Environment \n3-56. Company forces defend urban areas to defeat an attack, gain time, economize forces, protect \ninfrastructure, protect a populace, and shape conditions for offensive or stability tasks. Usually two or more \nof these tasks apply to the urban defense. Defensive tasks in urban environment provide commanders with \nopportunities to turn the environment’s characteristics to the advantage of Army forces. Urban areas are \nideal for defensive tasks and enhance the combat power of defending units. \nChapter 3 \n3-10  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 20163-57. Urban defensive success depends on synchronizing the following simultaneous operations as one \naction: \nDecisive operation may not be effective if the tasks mentioned previously are not integrated into\nthe overall mission plan.\nShaping operations vary greatly depending on the type of defense and create the conditions for\ndecisive operations.\nSustaining operations ensure freedom of action, secure lines of communications, and establish\nmovement control.\n3-58. In a built-up area, the defender takes advantage of inherent cover and concealment afforded by the \nurban environment. Stryker Infantry rifle companies maximize the use of their task organization with nine \ndismounted infantry squads, three weapons squads, and a sniper section. They are able to engage at closer \nranges to take advantage in close quarters combat. \n3-59. The company commander considers restrictions to the attacker ’s ability to maneuver and observe. \nThe Stryker vehicles can be emplaced to provide blocking positions at intersections, streets, alley ways, and \nentrances to structures. By using the terrain and fighting from well-prepared and mutually supporting \npositions, a defending force can delay, block, fix, or destroy a much larger attacking force. The defense of a \nbuilt-up area is organized around key terrain features, buildings, and areas that preserve the integrity of the \ndefense and provide the defender with ease of movement to include above ground and subterranean areas. \nThe defender organizes and plans his defense by observation and fields of fire, avenues of approach, key \nterrain, obstacles and movement, cover and concealment (OAKOC). (Refer to ATTP 3-06.11 for more \ninformation.) \nSnipers in Urban Environment \n3-60. Historically, snipers have been especially useful in urban areas. They provide long- and short-range \nprecision fires and help with company- and platoon-level isolation efforts. Snipers provide valuable \nprecision fires during stability tasks. Along with engaging assigned targets, snipers are a valuable asset to \nthe commander for providing observation along movement routes and suppressive fires during an assault. \n(Refer to TC 3-22.10 for more information.) \n3-61. The commander may assign the following tasks to snipers: \nConduct counter sniper operations.\nKill targets of opportunity. (The sniper team assigns priorities to these targets based on an\nunderstanding of the commander’s intent [for example, engaging enemy snipers, then leaders,\nvehicle commanders, radio men, sappers, and machine gun crews, in that order].)\nDeny enemy access to certain areas or avenues of approach (control key terrain).\nProvide fire support for barricades and other obstacles.\nMaintain surveillance of flank and rear avenues of approach (screen).\nSupport local counterattacks with precision fire.\nDefensive Tasks in Mountainous Terrain \n3-62. Defensive tasks in a mountainous terrain are conducted to resist, defeat, or destroy an enemy attack \nto support subsequent offensive actions. Commanders use defensive tasks to withstand an enemy attack \nwhile preparing to seize the initiative and develop conditions favorable for transitioning to the offense. \nDuring a defense, friendly forces withstand enemy attacks and hold the enemy while preparing to seize the \ninitiative and transition to an attack or to conduct stability tasks. A thorough understanding of the \ncommander ’s intent is especially critical in the defense, which demands precise integration of all assets to \ninclude maneuver and sustainment. \n3-63. Stryker forces operating in mountainous terrain environments often possess weapons and equipment \nmore advanced in technology than the enemy. Knowing this, enemy offensive tactics commonly involve \nshort violent engagements followed by a hasty withdrawal through preplanned routes. The enemy often \nstrikes quickly and fights only as long as the advantage of the initial surprise is in their favor. Attacks may \ninclude direct fires, indirect fires, or improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and may be against stationary or \nmoving forces. (Refer to ATTP 3-21.50 for more information.) In the defense of mountainous terrain, the \nDefense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 3-11 Stryker vehicles uses their mobility to maneuver to places of advantage, while the infantry secure severely \nrestricted and key terrain.  \n3-64. The RWS on Stryker vehicle can take advantage of engaging targets that are in positions of elevation \nabove them, thus allowing an engagement area with mounted forces shooting upward and Infantry shooting \ndownward. In severely restricted terrain the Infantry can dismount the MK-19 or .50 cal from the RWS to \nengage enemy from a position of tactical advantage. In this case the Soldiers leave the ICV in a hide \nposition. \nDesert Terrain \n3-65. In the desert terrain, the SBCT Infantry rifle company orients on primary enemy approaches in their \nassigned area of operation, units prepare for attack from any direction. It is neither possible nor necessary \nto have maximum firepower in all directions, move weapons to threatened areas before the enemy reaches \nthem. Air cover or an air defense umbrella is necessary for a successful defense. (Refer to FM 90.3 for \nmore information.) In general, some considerations for defensive tasks in a desert environment include, \nobstacles to site a defense are limited, and strong points to defend choke points and other key terrain, and \nmobility and sustainment are key factors. SBCT should take advantage of reverse slope defenses when \npossible in desert environments to negate weapon ranges standoff.  \nJungle Terrain \n3-66. Jungle defensive operations are based on the same defense fundamentals used in other operations. \nSome of the fundamentals, however, may acquire a special significance in the jungle. (Refer to FM 90.5 for \nmore information.) Considerations for defensive operations in a jungle environment are limited visibility \nand fields of fire, limited and restricted maneuver. \nSniper Employment \n3-67. Snipers play a vital role in the commander ’s planning and help the company maintain an offensive \nposture while in the defense. The sniper team can do the following in the defense: \nAugment the fires of the company.\nCover avenues of approach, obstacles, dead space, and key terrain features.\nProvide final protective fires, if necessary.\nDeter enemy infiltration attempts.\nOperate as an extension of patrols.\n3-68. During defensive tasks in urban environment, sniper teams work outside the FEBA to provide early \nwarning and disruption and, if possible, cause the enemy to deploy prematurely. Sniper teams do the \nfollowing in the defense: \nMove out during limited visibility.\nBuild hide positions that overwatch likely avenues of approach and NAIs.\nProvide early warning of impending attacks (day or night), probes, or infiltrations.\nReduce targets of opportunity.\nCollect data.\nCOMMON DEFENSIVE CONTROL MEASURES \n3-69. The commander uses control measures to control the defense and provide flexibility to respond to \nchanges in the situation. Control measures allow the defending commander to rapidly concentrate combat \npower at the decisive point. Defensive control measures within the commander’s AO include designating \nthe security area, the battle handover line (BHL), the MBA with its associated FEBA, and the echelon \nsupport area. The commander can use battle positions and additional direct fire control and fire support \ncoordination measures (FSCM) to further synchronize the employment of combat power. The commander \ndesignates disengagement lines to trigger the displacement of subordinate forces. (Refer to ADRP 3-90 for \nmore information.) \nChapter 3 \n3-12  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016BATTLE HANDOVER LINE \n3-70. The BHL is a designated PL on the ground where responsibility transitions from the stationary force \nto the moving force and vice versa. \nBATTLE POSITIONS  \n3-71. A battle position (BP)  is a defensive location oriented on a likely enemy avenue of approach. Units \nas large as battalion task forces and as small as squads or sections use BPs. They may occupy the \ntopographical crest of a hill, a forward slope, a reverse slope, or a combination of these areas. The \ncommander selects his positions based on terrain, enemy capabilities, and friendly capabilities. A \ncommander can assign all or some subordinates BPs within the AO. Leaders within the company should \nmanage integration of both mounted and dismounted forces to maximize the firepower of the two forces. \nInfantry should be in close proximity of their Stryker vehicles but far enough away from their weapons \nsecondary effects, especially with the MGS vehicle (see appendix A). Stryker vehicles wit h RWS should \ntake advantage of their battle positions by only exposing the RWS allowing the remainder of the vehicle to \nremain safely behind cover. \n3-72. There are five types of BPs. They are as follows: \nPrimary positions cover the area where the commander intends to contain or destroy an enemy\nforce (engagement area). (See figure 3-1 on page 3-13 .)\nAlternate positions are those assigned when the primary position becomes untenable or\nunsuitable for carrying out the assigned task. These positions allow the defender to carry out his\noriginal task. The following considerations apply for an alternate BP:\nIt covers the same avenue of approach or sector of fire as the primary BP.\nIt is located slightly to the front, flank, or rear of the primary BP.\nIt may be positioned forward of the primary BP during limited visibility.\nIt is employed to supplement or support positions with weapons of limited range, such as\ndismounted positions.\nSubsequent positions are those to which the unit expects to move during the course of the battle.\nA defending unit may have a series of subsequent positions. Subsequent positions can have\nprimary, alternate, and supplementary positions associated with the m.\nSupplementary position is a defensive position located within a unit ’s assigned AO that provides\nsectors of fire and defensible terrain along an avenue of approach that is not the enemy’s\nexpected avenue of attack. (See figure 3-2 on page 3-13.) For example, an avenue of approach\ninto a company ’s AO from one of its flanks could require the company to direct its platoons\n(PLTs) to establish supplementary positions to allow the platoons to engage enemy forces\ntraveling along that avenue. The platoon leader formally assigns supplementary positions when\nthe platoon covers more than one avenue of approach.\nStrong point is a heavily fortified BP tied to a natural or reinforcing obstacle to create an anchor\nfor the defense or to deny the enemy decisive or key terrain. The mission to create and defend a\nstrong point implies retention of terrain to stop or redirect enemy formations. Strong points\nrequire extensive time, engineer support, and Class IV resources to construct. A strong point is\nalso used to —\nCanalize enemy forces . Canalize is a tactical mission task in which the commander\nrestricts enemy movement to a narrow zone by exploiting terrain coupled with the use of\nobstacles, fires, or friendly maneuver.\nContain enemy forces. Contain is a tactical mission task that requires the commander to\nstop, hold, or surround enemy forces or to cause them to center their activity on a given\nfront and prevent them from withdrawing any part of their forces for use elsewhere.\nDefense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 3-13 \nLegend:  BP = battle position \nFigure 3-1. Primary, alternate, and subsequent battle positions \nLegend:  BP = battle position \nFigure 3-2. Supplementary battle position \nChapter 3 \n3-14  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016FORWARD EDGE OF THE BATTLE AREA \n3-73. The FEBA is the foremost limits of a series of areas in which ground combat units are deployed. \nExcluded areas are those in which the covering or screening forces are operating, designated to coordinate \nfire support, the positioning of forces, or the maneuver of units. These units normally require no fire areas \n(NFAs) placed over their position to prevent fratricide. \nMAIN BATTLE AREA  \n3-74. The MBA is the area where the commander intends to deploy the bulk of the unit’s combat power \nand conduct decisive operations to defeat an attacking enemy. The defending commander‘s major \nadvantage is the ability to select the ground on which the battle takes place. The defender positions \nsubordinate forces in mutually supporting positions in depth to absorb enemy penetrations or canalize them \ninto prepared EAs, defeating the enemy‘s attack by concentrating the effects of over whelming combat \npower. The natural defensive strength of the position determines the distribution of forces in relation to \nboth frontage and depth. Defending units typically employ field fortifications and obstacles to improve the \nterrain‘s natural defensi ve strength. The MBA includes the area where the defending force creates an \nopportunity to deliver a decisive counterattack to defeat or destroy the enemy. \nSECTION II – DEFENSE OF A LINEAR OBSTACLE \n3-75. Area defense is preferred in defense of a linear obstacle because it accepts less risk by not allowing \nthe enemy to cross the obstacle. Linear obstacles such as mountain ranges or river lines favor a forward \ndefense rather than a defense in depth. In a forward defense the linear obstacle may force the enemy force s \nto slow down, stop, mass, or canalize during their attempt to cross the linear obstacle providing an \nopportunity for the defending force to strike the enemy force.  \n3-76. The commander’s use of a defense in depth accepts the possibility that the enemy may forc e a \ncrossing at a given point within an area defense. The depth of the defense should prevent the enemy from \nrapidly exploiting its success. It defuses the enemy‘s combat power by forcing the enemy to contain \nbypassed friendly defensive positions besides continuing to attack positions in greater depth. \nPLAN \n3-77. Planning for a defense of a linear obstacle requires a thorough IPB analysis during the planning \nphase. Anticipation of how the enemy will react when it encounters the linear obstacle requires detailed \nanalysis and understanding. Determining the enemy COA either by information analysis, surveillance and \nreconnaissance or by answering PIR is desired to complete the plan. By identifying the enemy COA it \nallows the company to mass effective fires on the enemy force.  \n3-78. A defensive plan should be more flexible when there is less information of the enemy COA. A \nflexible plan can impact the task organization of forces. Techniques for the commander are as follows: \nAttach an MGS or ATGM vehicle to each of the Infantry platoons to allow them greater fire\npower.\nKeep the MGS platoon as a reserve or strike force to deploy to the decisive point to engage the\nenemy.\nAssign the MGS or ATGM platoon and Stryker vehicles an area that allows them the ability to\nengage with long er ranges of their weapon systems .\nEmplacing obstacles in front of the bridgehead of the linear obstacle to block enemy. Normally,\nattached engineers will conduct this task with scatterable mine field.\nEmplacing obstacles behind the bridgehead to separate or disrupt enemy forces. Normally,\nsupported field artillery will conduct this task with family of scatterable mines (FASCAM).\nAttaching Sniper team to an Infantry squad in an OP forward of the main defensive area to\nprovide early warning.\nSupporting or having the SBCT Infantry battalion scout platoon operating forward of your\ndefensive position.\nDefense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 3-15 PREPARE \n3-79. Preparing for the defense begins with the assembling of the company task organization to include \nenabling forces such as engineers, antiarmor company attachments, reconnaissance and security assets, or \nother elements. Attachments should be briefed on how the commander intends to defend his area. \nAttachments need to brief the commander on their status and capabilities and to ensure they can complete \nthe commander’s intent , and if possible enhance the defensive scheme of maneuver by adding \nconsiderations and recommendations that the commander may not be aware of. TLPs need to be completed \nand the company OPORD needs to be briefed to all involved. Once attachments have been integrated into \nthe company they need to be assigned and linked up with the platoons or other members of the company to \nmaneuver to their assigned area and begin setting up the defense.  \n3-80. Securing additional material such as additional Class IV and V is next in the prepare phase. Material \nshould then be distributed to the operational elements to begin preparation of additional obstacles to \nenhance the defense of the linear obstacle, prepositioning other classes of supply, construction, and \ncontinual improvement of current, alternate, supplementary, and subsequent battle positions, and so forth, \nfrom the established priorities of work. Emphasis should be placed on security because of enemy’s \ncapability of reconnaissance assets or forces that either identify the defensive positions or disrupt the \npreparation of the defense. Techniques for security during preparation may include assigning a security \nforce to establish OPs, patrols, sniper engagements, or a platoon conducting a screen or ambush .  \n3-81. The Stryker company commander receives constant status updates of defensive preparations and \nperforms quality control of the company’s defensive preparations.  Monitoring progress is key to ensure that \nthe commander’s intent is met. Preparing the defense  should be continuous until the moment of execution.  \n3-82. Rehearsals at all levels are conducted in the preparation phase and include combined arms rehearsal, \nfires, and sustainment. Preparation in the defense is a continuous effort that can always be improved upon. \nFatigue from preparation can become a factor and the commander must consider a rest plan as part of the \npreparation so that Soldiers are capable of fighting in the defense. \nEXECUTE \n3-83. Execution begins with warning or contact with the enemy force. Warning can come from the \nadjacent, higher, or your own forces. The company can make enemy contact by any of the eight forms of \ncontact that apply to the enemy. That contact allows the defending company to know where at least a \nportion of the attacking enemy is currently positioned. That contact can allow the enemy to know where a \nportion of the defending company is located. When the warning of enemy is received it needs to \nimmediately disseminate and the defense needs to begin.  \n3-84. Key to the defense scheme of maneuver is the identification of the enemy COA. Adjustments to the \nenemy C OA from the commander’s scheme of maneuver needs to be controlled with mission command. \nActions on contact need to yield actionable information that the company/team can react to. Effective fires, \nmass of combat forces and engagement/disengagement need to be executed. The company should try to \nforce the enemy into its engagement areas, reinforce fires, add depth, block penetrations, restore positions, \nor counter attack to destroy enemy forces and seize the initiative.  \nASSESS \n3-85. Assessment is continuous throughout the completion of prepare and execution phases. The Stryker \ncompany commander’s assessment reveals threats to the chosen defensive scheme, suggests improvements \nto effectiveness, and reveals opportunities. The company commander determines the differences \n(variances) between the actual situation and what the original defensive scheme forecasted the situation \nwould be at any given time based on the commander’s own observations and reports from the company’s \nsubordinate organic units and any attachments. The commander’s evaluation of these variances considers \nwhether the desired conditions have changed, are no longer achievable, or are not achievable if the \ncompany continues to execute the original defensive scheme. The commander makes adjustments to that \ndefensive scheme and issues the necessary oral orders (see figure 3-3). These adjustments may have been \npreviously developed as part of a previously developed decision support template. They include assigning \nChapter 3 \n3-16  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016new tasks to subordinates, reprioritizing support, and significantly modifying the chosen defensive course \nof action. \nLegend:  EA = engagement area, FPF = final protective fire, FASCAM = family of scatterable mines, MGS = \nmobile gun system, NAI = named area of interest \nFigure 3-3. Defense of a linear obstacle \nSECTION III – PERIMETER DEFENSE \n3-86. A perimeter defense is a defense oriented in all directions. The SBCT Infantry rifle company uses it \nfor self-security, and to protect other units located within the perimeter. The SBCT rifle company can \nemploy a perimeter defense in urban or woodland terrain. In terms of positioning forces, weapons \nemplacement, direct and indirect fire integration, and reserve employment, the commander conducting a \nperimeter defense plans to respond to the widest possible range of enemy actions. The SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany might be called upon to execute the perimeter defense under a variety of conditions, including — \nDefense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 3-17 When it secures itself against attacks in an urban area. This technique may apply if the company\nconserves or builds combat power to execute offensive or patrolling.\nWhen it holds critical terrain in areas where the defense is not tied in with adjacent units.\nWhen it has been bypassed and isolated by the enemy and when to defend in place.\nWhen it conducts occupation of an independent assembly area or reserve position.\nWhen it begins preparation of a strong point.\nWhen it is directed to concentrate fires into two or more adjacent avenues of approach.\n3-87. The commander should consider the following while in a perimeter defense: \nPlacing security as far out as possible. Maximize the use of optics and sensors to provide early\nwarning.\nPositioning antiarmor weapons and MGS vehicles in protected positions, and concentrating their\nfires on armor avenues of approach and related EA s.\nBuilding protected positions that allow the RWS to engage targets without exposing the hull of\nthe Stryker vehicle.\nMaintaining a reserve, usually a squad-size element with their Stryker vehicle for a company.\nRetention of key terrain.\nLocation of the reserve and criteria to deploy them.\nMission control.\nSustainment operations and sustainment security.\nPLANNING AND PREPARI NG \n3-88. Planning for a perimeter defense can be deliberate or executed as a battle drill to be utilized on \ncommand. Estimated time spent occupying a location of the perimeter defense determines the level of \nplanning and coordination involved. The longer the time of occupation the more built up the defensive \nperimeter should be. An example of a long term perimeter defense is a combat outpost that requires \nbarriers, structures, additional communication assets, and engineer support. Hasty perimeter defense can be \nestablished quickly during security halts by forming a perimeter with Stryker vehicles. Preparing a \nperimeter defense is a continuous ongoing task that is conducted with the company commander \nestablishing priorities of work. Perimeter defenses are prepared in this order: \nReconnaissance of the area to defend.\nOccupation of the area.\nEstablish security.\nBegin priorities of work.\nEXECUTING \n3-89. The company commander organizes his forces according to the perimeter defense plan (see \nfigure 3-4). He places his most casualty producing weapon system first at the most likely enemy avenue of \napproach and tries to use the maximize effective the range of the MGS. The remainder of the Stryker \nvehicles forms a perimeter in their assigned areas. Infantry establish defensive positions to ensure that the \nperimeter is completely covered 360 degrees. Normally, Infantry seek higher ground forward of their ICV \nto provide better security to their position. They emplace their Javelins and use the optics on the CLU to \nincrease their site range . The mortar section and company headquarters section usually locate in the center \nof the perimeter. The mortar section establishes a mortar fire position (MFP) with its dismounted 60-mm \nmortars and mounted 120-mm mortars. Once the perimeter is formed and the commander establishes his \npriorities of work, he can begin to send out security patrols. \nASSESSING \n3-90. Adjustments in the perimeter are constant to ensure the security. The leaders should constantly \ncheck, inspect and update the perimeter defense plan. All adjustments need to be communicated to the \ncommander. He is responsible for the coordination of the perimeter.  \nChapter 3 \n3-18  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  \nLegend:  EA = engagement area, TRP = target reference point \nFigure 3-4. Perimeter defense \nSECTION IV – REVERSE-SLOPE DEFENSE \n3-91. An alternative to defending on the forward slope of a hill or a ridge is to defend on a reverse slope. \nIn such a defense, the SBCT Infantry rifle company is deployed on terrain that is masked from enemy \ndirect fire and ground observation by the crest of a hill. Although some units and weapons might be \npositioned on the forward slope, the crest, or the counterslope (a forward slope of a hill to the rear of a \nreverse slope), most forces are on the reverse slope. The key to this defense is control of the crest by direct \nfire.  \n3-92. The commander can adopt a reverse slope position wh en— \nEnemy fire makes the forward slope untenable.\nLack of cover and concealment on the forward slope makes it untenable.\nDefense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 3-19 The forward slope has been lost or has not yet been gained.\nThe forward slope is exposed to enemy direct fire weapons fired from beyond the effective\nrange of the defender ’s weapons. Moving to the reverse slope removes the attacker ’s standoff\nadvantage.\nThe terrain on the reverse slope provides better fields of fire than the forward slope.\nThe defender avoids creating a dangerous salient or reentrant in friendly lines.\nSurprising and deceiving the enemy as to the true location of the SBCT Infantry battalion\ndefensive positions is essential.\n3-93. When executing a reverse slope defense, the SBCT Infantry rifle company commander places \nspecial emphasis on — \nA fire support plan to prevent the enemy’s occupation and use of the crest of the hill.\nThe use of OPs or reconnaissance elements on the forward slope to provide observation across\nthe entire front and security to the main battle positions.\nA counterattack plan that specifies measures necessary to clear the crest or regain it from the\nenemy.\nFire support to destroy, disrupt, and attrite enemy forces on the forward slope.\n3-94. The forward edge of the position should be within small arms range of the crest. It should be far \nenough from the crest that fields of fire allow the defender time to place well-aimed fire on the enemy \nbefore he reaches friendly positions. The company can deploy the sniper team or establish OPs on or \nforward of the topographical crest. This allows long-range precision fires, observation, and early warning \nover the entire front and indirect fire coverage of forward obstacles. OPs are usually provided by the unit \nthat owns the terrain being observed, and may vary in size from a few Soldiers to a reinforced squad. They \nshould include FOs; their number should be increased to improve security at night. \nSPECIAL C ONSIDERATIONS  \n3-95. The following are considerations that commanders may apply when defending on a reverse slope: \nObservation of the enemy is more difficult. Soldiers in this position see forward no farther than\nthe crest. This makes it hard to determine exactly where the enemy is as he advances, especially\nwhen visibility is poor. OPs are placed forward of the topographic crest for early warning and\nlong-range observation.\nDisplacing from the reverse slope defense is difficult because the defender must move up a hill.\nThe defender is decisively engaged in a reverse slope defense.\nFields of fire are usually short negating weapon range advantages. Normally, the defender has\nthe opportunity to engage with direct fire weapon systems first.\nObstacles on the forward slope can be covered only with indirect fire or by units on the flanks of\nthe company unless some weapons systems are initially placed forward.\nIf the enemy gains the crest, he can assault downhill. This may give him a psychological\nadvantage.\nIf OPs are insufficient or improperly placed, the defenders might have to fight an enemy who\nsuddenly appears in strength at close range.\n3-96. The slope degrades the enemy from being able to conduct reconnaissance and retreat if committed to \nan attack. The Stryker vehicles can provide direct fire with their mounted crew served weapons and \nmaneuver to positions of tactical advantage. (See figure 3-5.) \nChapter 3 \n3-20  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016\nLegend:  EA = engagement area \nFigure 3-5. Reverse slope considerations \nPLAN \n3-97. Planning for a reverse slope defense will require thorough IPB analysis during the planning phase. \nAnticipation of how the enemy will react when it encounters the defense requires detailed analysis and \nunderstanding. Making a defensive plan will require determining where the enemy descends either by \ncombat information, reconnaissance, or intelligence. By identifying where the enemy descends allows the \ncompany commander time to mass effective fires on the enemy force.  \nPREPARE  \n3-98. Preparing for the reverse slope defense begins with the assembling of the company task organization \nand the completion of TLPs. Strong emphasis should be placed on concealing defensive positions, \nchanneling the enemy into EAs, and blocking attempts to occupy dead space by emplacing obstacles and \ncovering with indirect fires.   \nEXECUTE  \n3-99. Execution begins with warning or contact with the enemy force. Warning can come from the \nadjacent, higher, or organic forces. Ideally direct fire contact should be initiated by friendly forces, due to \nthe close proximity of the enemy forces in a reverse slope defense (see figure 3 -6 on page 3-21). The \ncommander should quickly assess his defensive plan if an enemy force initiates contact.   \nDefense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 3-21 \nLegend:  EA = engagement area, MGS = mobile gun system, PL = phase line, TRP = target reference point \nFigure 3-6. SBCT Example of a reverse slope \nNote.  FIGURE 3-6 SCENARIO  — The company commander places the sniper team, MGS \nplatoon, and a Stryker Infantry rifle platoon forward. The forward Infantry platoon splits into \nsections, dismount, and secure the high ground on the flanks of the MGS platoon. They engage \nthe enemy in engagement area ( EA) Alpha to draw them in. On order, the forward element \ndisengages and repositions. The Stryker Infantry rifle platoon consolidates in its secondary \nposition. The MGS platoon moves to a reserve or striker force behind the second hill. The \ncompany engages the remaining enemy force in EAs Echo, Omega, and Zulu in a reverse slope \ndefense. (See figure 3-7 on page 3-23 .) \nChapter 3 \n3-22  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016ASSESS  \n3-100. Assessment is continuous throughout the completion of prepare and execution phases. \nIdentification of commander’s critical information requirement ( CCIR ) assists the assessments with the \ndecision support templates or the commanders’ orders. Assessment will force the commander to determine \ncommitment of the reserve force, engagement/break contact, consolidate and reorganize, counterattack, or \nrecommend pursuit. \nSECTION V – ENGAGEMENT AREA D EVELOPMENT \n3-101. The EA is where the commander intends to trap and destroy an enemy force using the massed fires \nof all available weapons. By studying the terrain, the commander tries to determine the principal enemy \nand friendly heavy, light, and air avenues of approach. The commander determines the most advantageous \narea for the enemy’s main attack, as well as other mission variables of observation and fields of fire, \navenues of approach, key terrain, obstacles, and cover and concealment (OAKOC). (See A TP 3-34.80 for a \ndetailed discussion of OAKOC.) \n3-102. The success of any engagement depends on how effectively the commander can integrate the \nobstacle plan, the indirect fire plan, and the direct fire plan within the EA to achieve the SBCT Infantry \nrifle company’s tactic al purpose. \n3-103. At the company level, EA development is a complex function, demanding parallel planning and \npreparation if the company is to accomplish the tasks for which it is responsible. Despite this complexity, \nEA development resembles a drill in that the commander and his subordinate leaders use an orderly, fairly \nstandard set of procedures. The steps of EA development are not a rigid sequential process; some steps may \noccur simultaneously to ensure the synergy of combined arms. The development process covers these steps \nbeginning with evaluation of METT-TC variables: \nIdentify all likely enemy avenues of approach.\nDetermine likely enemy schemes of maneuver.\nDetermine where to kill the enemy.\nPlan and integrate obstacles.\nEmplace weapons systems.\nPlan and integrate indirect fires.\nRehearse the execution of operations in the EA.\nIDENTIFY LIKELY ENEMY AVENUES OF APPROACH \n3-104. The company commander and the COIST, if available, can use the following techniques and \nconsiderations when identifying the enemy ’s likely avenues of approach (see figure 3-7 on page 3-23): \nConduct initial reconnaissance of the terrain using OAKOC. If possible, do this from the\nenemy ’s perspective along each avenue of approach into the sector of fire or EA. FBCB2 can\ngraphically assist the company commander by building a Modified Combined Obstacle\nOverlay (MCOO).\nIdentify key and decisive terrain. This includes locations that afford positions of advantage\nover the enemy, and natural obstacles and choke points that restrict forward movement.\nDetermine which avenues provide cover and concealment for the enemy while allowing him\nto maintain his tempo. FBCB2 can graphically assist the company commander by showing\nline of sight data.\nDetermine which terrain the enemy is likely to use to support each avenue.\nEvaluate lateral routes adjoining each avenue of approach.\nDefense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 3-23 \nLegend:  AA = avenue of approach \nFigure 3-7. Likely enemy avenues of approach \nDETERMINE ENEMY SCHEME OF MANEUVER \n3-105. The SBCT Infantry rifle company commander and COIST, if available, can use the following \nconsiderations when determining the enemy’s scheme of maneuver  (see figure 3-8): \nDetermine how the enemy will structure the attack.\nDetermine how the enemy will use his reconnaissance assets. Will he attempt to infiltrate\nfriendly positions?\nDetermine where and when the enemy will change formations or establish support by fire\npositions.\nDetermine where, when, and how the enemy will conduct his assault or breaching operations.\nDetermine where and when he will commit follow-on forces.\nDetermi ne the enemy’s expected rates of movement.\nAssess the effects of his combat multipliers, the anticipated locations, and areas of employment.\nDetermine what reactions the enemy is likely to have in response to projected friendly actions.\nChapter 3 \n3-24  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  \nLegend:  AA = avenue of approach, PL = phase line, PLD = probable line of deployment \nFigure 3-8. Example enemy scheme \nDETERMINE WHERE TO ENGAGE THE ENEMY \n3-106. The following steps identify and mark where the SBCT Infantry rifle company will engage the \nenemy (see figure 3-9 on page 3-25): \nIdentify TRPs that match the enemy’s scheme of maneuver allowing the SBCT Infantry rifle\ncompany to identify where it will engage enemy forces through the depth of the sector of fire.\nIdentify and record the exact location, composition, and intent of each TRP. TRPs within the\nSBCT can be of different composition because of the use of different weapon systems to engage\ndifferent types of targets. For example thermal sights are used to ensure visibility at the\nappropriate range under varying conditions when marking TRPs from MGS and RWS. Daylight\nand limited visibility TRPs can be used by infantry for because of their weapon sights.\nDetermine how many weapons systems will engage fires on each TRP to achieve the desired\nend state.\nDetermine engagement lines for all weapons systems.\nDetermine which platoons will mass fires on each TRP.\nDefense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 3-25 Establish EAs around TRPs.\nDevelop the direct fire planning measures necessary to fire at each TRP.\nLegend:  EA = engagement area, PL = phase line, PLD = probable line of deployment, TRP = target reference \npoint \nFigure 3-9.

The following steps apply in planning and integrating obstacles in the SBCT Infantry rifle company \ndefense (see figure 3-10 ): \nDetermine the obs tacle group’s intent confirming the target, relative location, and effect. Ensure\nintent supports the task force scheme of maneuver.\nIdentify, site, and mark the obstacles within the obstacle group.\nIntegrate protective obstacle types and locations within SBCT Infantry rifle company defense.\nEnsure coverage of all obstacles with direct fires.\nAssign responsibility for guides and lane closure, as required.\nEmplace obstacles based on analysis of the mission variables of METT-TC, secure Class IV and\nV point, secure mine dump, or secure obstacle work sites.\nChapter 3 \n3-26  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016Coordinate engineer disengagement criteria, actions on contact, and security requirements with\nthe engineer platoon leader at the obstacle work site if the company is supported by an engineer\nplatoon.\nLege nd: EA = engagement area, PL = phase line, PLD = probable line of deployment, TRP = target reference \npoint \nFigure 3-10 .

Observers will include the\nFIST and members of maneuver elements with fire support responsibilities.\nEstablish triggers based on enemy movement rates.\nObtain accurate target locations using survey or navigational equipment.\nRefine target locations to ensure coverage of obstacles.\nAdjust artillery and mortar targets.\nPlan FPF.\nRequest critical friendly zone (CFZ) for maneuver units and no fire areas ( NFA s) for OPs and\nforward positions.\nLegend: EA = engagement area, FPF = final protective fire, PL = phase line, PLD = probable line of \ndeployment, TRP = target reference point \nFigure 3-12 . Integrate indirect fires \nDefense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 3-29 ENGAGEMENT AREA REHEARSAL \n3-110. The purpose of this rehearsal is to ensure that every leader and Soldier understands the plan and \nthat elements are prepared to cover their assigned areas with direct and indirect fires. Although the SBCT \nInfantry rifle company commander has several options, the most common and most effective type is the \nmounted rehearsal. One technique for the mounted rehearsal in the defense is to have the SBCT Infantry \nrifle company trains, under the control of the company XO, move through the EA to depict the enemy force \nwhile the commander and subordinate platoons rehearse the operation from the company BP. The rehearsal \nshould cover the following actions: \nRearward passage of security forces (as required).\nClosure of lanes (as required).\nMovement from the hide position to the BP.\nUse of fire commands, triggers, or maximum engagement lines (MEL) to initiate direct and\nindirect fires.\nShifting of fires to concentrate and redistribute fire effects.\nPreparation and transmission of critical reports using FM and digital systems (as applicable).\nAssessment of enemy weapons systems effects.\nDisplacement to alternate, supplementary, or subsequent BPs.\nCross-leveling or resupply of Class V.\nEvacuation of casualties.\n3-111. The SBCT Infantry rifle company commander should coordinate the rehearsal with the SBCT \nInfantry battalion to ensure that other units’ rehearsals do not conflict with his own. Coordination leads to \nefficient use of planning and preparation time for all SBCT Infantry battalion units. It eliminates the danger \nof misidentification of friendly forces in the rehearsal area, which could result in fratricide. \nSECTION VI – TRANSITIONS \n3-112. During the planning for any operation, the commander discerns the follow-on missions from the \nhigher headquarters’ OPORD and begin s to plan how they intend to achieve them. The SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany pauses to consolidate and reorganize before the next operation. If required, the commander \ndecides the best time and location that facilitates future operations and provides security. (Refer to \nFM 3-90-1 for more information.) \nCONSO\nLIDATION \n3-113. The company commander plans and prepares for this phase of the operation as part of his TLPs for \nthe entire mission. He ensures that the company is ready to conduct the following actions that usually are \npart of consolidation: \nEliminate enemy resistance on the objective.\nEstablish security beyond the objective by securing areas that may be the source of enemy\ndirect fires or enemy artillery observation.\nEstablish additional security measures such as OPs and patrols.\nPrepare for and assist the passage of follow-on forces (if required).\nContinue to improve security by conducting other necessary defensive actions. These\ndefensive actions include EA development, direct fire planning, and BP preparation.\nAdjust FPF and register targets along likely mounted and dismounted avenues of approach.\nProtect the obstacle reduction effort.\nSecure EPW and detainees.\nPrepare for the enemy counterattack.\nChapter 3 \n3-30  ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  REORGANIZATION \n3-114. Reorganization usually is conducted concurrently with consolidation. It consists of actions taken \nto prepare the SBCT Infantry rifle company for follow-on operations. As with consolidation, the company \ncommander plans and prepares for reorganization as he conducts his TLPs. He ensures that the company \ntakes the following actions: \nProvide essential medical treatment and arrange for MEDEVAC of the sick, injured, and\nwounded as needed.\nTreat and evacuate wounded EPWs and detainees and process the remainder of EPWs and\ndetainees.\nCross-level personnel and adjust task organization when necessary to support the next phase\nor mission.\nConducts resupply operations, to include rearming and refueling.\nRedistribute ammunition and other supplies.\nConduct required maintenance.\nContinue improvement of defensive positions, as needed.\nCONTINUING OPERATIONS \n3-115. The SBCT Infantry rifle company may continue the defense, or if ordered, transition to focus on \nthe conduct of offensive or stability tasks at the conclusion of an engagement. The commander considers \nthe higher commander’s concept of operations, friendly capabilities, and the enemy situation when making \nthis decision. All missions should include plans for exploiting success or assuming a defense. \nTRANSITION TO RETROGRADE \n3-116. A defending commander may transition from participating in a higher echelon’s area or mobile \ndefense to the retrograde as a part of continuing operations. A retrograde usually involves a combination of \ndelay, withdrawal, and retirement operations. These operations may occur simultaneously or sequentially. \nAs in other operations, the commander’s concept of operations and intent drive planning for retrograde \noperations. Each form of retrograde operation has its unique planning considerations, but considerations \ncommon to all retrograde operations are risk, the need for synchronization, and rear operations. \nTRANSITION TO OFFENSE \n3-117. Higher headquarters may order the SBCT Infantry rifle company to conduct an attack, movement \nto contact, or participate in exploitation. In some cases, the defensive tasks might immediately transition \ninto a pursuit.  \n3-118. The company may execute a counterattack to destroy exposed enemy elements and free decisively \nengaged friendly elements. A base of fire element suppresses or fixes the enemy force while the \ncounterattack (maneuver) element moves on a concealed route to a subsequent battle position to engage the \nenemy in the flank or rear. The counterattack element maneuvers rapidly to its firing position, often \nfighting through enemy flank security elements, to complete the counterattack before the enemy can bring \nfollow-on forces forward to influence the fight. \n3-119. Execution of the counterattack is similar to that for an attack by fire. Planning and preparation \nconsiderations for the counterattack vary depending on the purpose and location of the operation. (For \nexample, the counterattack may be conducted forward of friendly positions, requiring the reserve force to \nmove around friendly elements and through their protective and tactical obstacles.) In other situations, the \ncommander may use a counterattack by fire to block, fix, or contain a penetration. In any case, the reserve \nforce conducts the counterattack as an enemy-oriented operation. \nDefense \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 3-31 TRANSITION TO OPERATION FOCUSED ON S TABILITY TASKS \n3-120. The SBCT Infantry rifle company commander should plan a defensive contingency with on-order \noffensive missions in an operation focused on stability tasks that could deteriorate. Subordinate leaders \nneed to be fully trained to recognize activities that would initiate this transition such as the disbandment of \ngovernment or conventional security forces .  \n3-121. Company commanders and Soldiers need to be aware that elements of the BCT could be \nconducting offensive, defensive, and stability tasks simultaneously within a small radius of each other. \nROE is assessed, updated, disseminated, and trained on while this transition occurs. Establishing security \nwithin the area of operation for civilian population may call for a rapid response and initiative. The St ryker \nInfantry rifle company makes these transitions rapidly through dissemination of information with Mission \nCommand Systems, leadership that takes the initiative, and active reconnaissance.  \nThis page intentionally left blank.   \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 4-1 Chapter 4 \nStability \nStability components of operations leverage the coercive and constructive capabilities \nof the military force to establish a safe and secure environment, facilitate \nreconciliation between local or regional adversaries; establish political, legal, social, \nand economic institutions; and facilitate the transition of responsibility to a legitimate \ncivil authority. This chapter discusses SBCT Infantry rifle company role in support to \nstability tasks. It addresses SBCT Infantry rifle company, planning and operations \nconsiderations, and transitions. \nSECTION I – OVERVIEW OF STABILITY \n4-1. Stabilization is the process by which underlying tensions that might lead to resurgence in violence \nand a breakdown in law and order are managed and reduced, while efforts are made to support \npreconditions for successful long-term development (ADRP 1-02). Stability operations encompass various \nmilitary missions, tasks, and activities conducted outside the United States in coordination with other \ninstruments of national power to maintain or reestablish a safe and secure environment; provide essential \ngovernmental services, emergency infrastructure reconstruction, and humanitarian relief (JP 3-0).  \nSTABILITY FRAMEWORK \n4-2. A stability framework based on conditions within the area of operations of initial response, \ntransformation, and fostering stability, helps the unit determine the required training and task organization \nof forces prior to initial deployment, and serves as a guide to actions in an operation focused on stability \ntasks. (Refer to ATP 3-07.5 for more information.) Stability tasks occur in three phases described in the \nfollowing paragraphs. These phases facilitate identifying lead responsibilities and determining priorities \nand describe the conditions on the operational environment.  \nINITIAL R ESPONSE P HASE \n4-3. These actions generally reflect activity executed to stabilize a crisis state in the area of operations. \nArmy conventional force units typically perform initial response actions during, or directly after, a conflict \nor disaster in which the security situation prohibits the introduction of civilian personnel. Initial response \nactions aim to provide a secure environment that allows relief forces to attend to the immediate \nhumanitarian needs of the local population. They reduce the level of violence and human suffering while \ncreating conditions that enable other actors to participate safely in relief efforts.  \nTRANSFORMATION P HASE \n4-4. Stabilization, reconstruction, and capacity-building are transformation phase actions that are \nperformed in a relatively secure environment. Transformation phase actions take place in either crisis or \nvulnerable states. There is the presence of a legitimate authority either interim or established as well as \nindigenous host nation security forces. These actions aim to build host-nation capacity across multiple \nsectors. Transformation phase actions are essential to the continuing stability of the environment. These \nactions are essential to fostering stability within the area.  \nFOSTERING SUSTAINABILITY P HASE \n4-5. These are actions that encompass long-term efforts, which capitalize on capacity building and \nreconstruction activities. Successful accomplishment of these actions establishes conditions that enable \nsustainable development. Usually military forces perform fostering sustainability phase actions only when \nthe security environment is stable enough to support efforts to implement the long-term programs that \nChapter 4 \n4-2 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016commit to the viability of the institutions and economy of the host nation. Often military forces conduct \nthese long-term efforts to support broader, civilian-led efforts.  \nSTABILITY PRINCIPLES \n4-6. The SBCT applies stability principles to conduct their operations. The SBCT Infantry rifle company \nmust understand the stability principles as they guide the higher commander intent for operations that they \nparticipate in.  \nCONFLICT TRANSFORMATION  \n4-7. Conflict transformation is the process of converting the actors and conditions that motivate violent \nconflict into the governmental process to address the causes of instability (ADRP 3-07). It aims to set the \nhost nation on a sustainable, positive trajectory in which transformational processes directly address the \ndynamics causing instability.  \nUNITY OF EFFORT  \n4-8. Military operations typically demand unity of command, the challenge for military and civilian \nleaders is to forge unity of effort or unity of purpose among the diverse array of actors involved in a \nstability operation. This is the essence of unified action : the synchronization, coordination, and integration \nof the activities of governmental and nongovernmental entities with military operations to achieve unity of \neffort (JP 1). Unity of effort is the coordination and cooperation toward common objectives, even if the \nparticipants are not necessarily part of the same command or organization which is the product of \nsuccessful unified action (JP 1). Unity of effort is fundamental to successfully incorporating all the \ninstruments of national power in a collaborative approach when conducting stability tasks in operations.  \nLEGITIMACY AND HOST-NATION OWNERSHIP  \n4-9. Legitimacy is a condition based upon the perception by specific audiences of the legality, morality, \nor rightness of a set of actions, and of the propriety of the authority of the individuals or organizations in \ntaking them. Legitimacy enables host-nation ownership by building trust and confidence among the people. \nThe principle of legitimacy impacts every aspect of operations from every conceivable perspective. \nLegitimacy of the host-nation government and mission enables successful operations characterized by \nstability tasks.  \nBUILDING PARTNER CAPACITY  \n4-10. Building partner capacity is the outcome of comprehensive inter-organizational activities, programs, \nand military-to -military engagements that enhance the ability of partners to establish security, governance, \neconomic development, essential services, and other critical government functions. Brigades apply a \ncomprehensive approach to sustained engagement with foreign and domestic partners to co-develop \nmutually beneficial capabilities and capacities to address shared global interests. Unified action is an \nindispensable feature of building partner capacity. In operations characterized by stability tasks, unified \naction to enhance the ability of partners for security, governance, economic development, essential \nservices, and other critical government functions exemplifies building partner capacity.  \nSTABILITY TASKS \n4-11. Army forces conduct the following five primary stability tasks: establish civil security, establish civil \ncontrol, restore essential services, support to governance, and support to economic and infrastructure \ndevelopment. At brigade level and below, the primary stability tasks are too broad to direct effort to \nexecute independently. They require partnership with outside organizations because they ultimately invoke \npolitical objectives executed in partnership with civic, security, humanitarian, and military organizations. \nAt lower tactical echelons efforts require understanding of specific aspects of the local situation to identify \nand mitigate sources of instability. The SBCT Infantry rifle company uses the acronym SWEAT-MSO \n(sewage, water, electricity, academics, trash, medical, security, and other considerations), and PMESII-PT \n(Political, Military, Economic, Social, Infrastructure, Information, Physical Environment, and Time) to \naddress the need to bring about stability in their area of operation. (Refer to ATP 3-07.5 for more \ninformation on stability techniques.) \nStability \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 4-3 4-12. The SBCT Infantry rifle company makes the greatest contribution in establish civil security and \nestablish civil control during the initial response and transformation phases of stability operations. Restore \nessential services, support to governance, support to economic infrastructure and development are tasks that \nthe company must utilize partnership with unified action partners to improve. Unity of command and an \nunderstanding with all unified action partners to include civil affairs units, HNSF, HN government forces, \ninternational aid organizations, and so forth for a single focused direction of progress in these efforts is \nideal. \nESTABLISH CIVIL S ECURITY  \n4-13. Establishing civil security involves providing for the safety of the HN and its population, to include \nsecurity from internal and external threats; it is essential to providing a safe and secure environment. Civil \nsecurity includes a diverse set of activities. These range from enforcing peace agreements to conducting \ndisarmament, demobilization, reintegration, and includes biometric identity data collection to identify \ncriminal elements, known and suspected terrorists ( KST s), and other irregular forces.  \n4-14. Until a legitimate civil government can assume responsibility for the security, military forces \nperform the tasks associated with civil security. At the same time, they help develop HN security and police \nforces. Normally, the responsibility for establishing and maintaining civil security belongs to military \nforces from the onset of operations through transition, when HN security and police forces assume this role. \nESTABLISH CIVIL C ONTROL  \n4-15. Establishing civil control is an initial step toward instituting stable, effective governance. Although \nestablishing civil security may be the primary responsibility of military forces in a stability mission, this \ncan only be accomplished by restoring civil control. Internal threats may manifest themselves as an \ninsurgency, subversive elements within the population, organized crime, or general lawlessness. \n4-16. Civil control regulates selected behavior and activities of individuals and groups. This control \nreduces risk to individuals or groups and promotes security. Curfews and traffic checkpoints, together with \nbiometric identity data collection, are examples of civil control. \nRESTORE ESSENTIAL SERVICES  \n4-17. The SBCT Infantry rifle company is capable of providing only minimal essential services. Normally, \nthe military force supports other government, intergovernmental, and HN agencies improving essential \nservices. However, a plan for providing emergency services include: \nEmergency medical care and rescue. The SBCT rifle company can participate in civic action\nprogram (MEDCAP) and other medical type events. However, most of the time this will need to\nbe run by a higher echelon. MEDCAP can be very beneficial in gaining the trust of the local\npopulation.\nProviding food and water. The SBCT generally needs to be augmented to provide food and\nwater to the local population. However, a plan for providing food and water should be made in\ncase the need arises.\nProviding emergency shelter. The SBCT generally needs to be augmented to provide emergency\nshelter to the local population. However, a plan for providing emergency shelter should be made\nin case the need arises. This plan should be developed with higher echelons and with HNSF.\nSUPPORT TO GOVERNANCE  \n4-18. Stability tasks establish conditions that enable interagency and HN actions to succeed. The military \nforce focuses on transferring control to a legitimate civil authority according to the desired end state. The \nSBCT Infantry rifle company, as part of larger unit, can provide support to governance that could include \nthe following: \nSupport development of local governance.\nSupport anticorruption initiatives.\nRegulate traffic, collect biometric identify data, and searches.\nSecurity for indigenous authorities.\nChapter 4 \n4-4 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016Properly detaining suspected criminals and properly holding criminal evidence for the HN’s\ncivil administration of justice.\nTraining HNSF and police.\nSecurity at election sites and ballot transfers.\nSUPPORT TO ECONOMIC AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT  \n4-19. Support to economic and infrastructure development helps a HN develop capability and capacity in \nthese areas. It may involve direct and indirect military assistance to local, regional, and national entities.  \nSECTION II – PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS \n4-20. An SBCT Infantry rifle company is not independently capable of achieving the desired end state of \nstability tasks. The SBCT Infantry rifle company achieves success in stability through partnership at the \nlocal level by identifying and mitigating sources of instability through partnership and coordinated support \nfrom its higher headquarters in collaboration with their unified action partners. The SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany performs company level missions, tasks, and activities that support the its higher headquarters \nefforts to maintain or reestablish a safe and secure environment, provide essential governmental services, \nemergency infrastructure reconstruction and humanitarian relief, and foster economic development. \n4-21. As combat operations clear and secure areas of hostile forces, part of the force secures critical \ninfrastructure and populated areas. Establishing civil security and civil control and the provision of \nessential services are implied tasks for commanders during any mission. Commanders are legally obligated \nto minimize civilian suffering.  \n4-22. Commanders plan to minimize the effects of combat on the populace. Properly focused, effectively \nexecuted stability tasks prevent population centers from degenerating into civil unrest and becoming \nrecruiting areas for opposition movements or insurgencies. \n4-23. The commander plans for stability tasks in a manner similar to the offense and defense. The planning \nprocess is continuous, constantly adapting as the conditions of the OE are shaped by activities, both natural \nand human. The resultant plan fosters flexibility, initiative, and adaptability in the face of unforeseen \nevents. The following warfighting functions discuss planning considerations and activities critical for \nmission success. \nMISSION COMMAND \n4-24. Stability tasks, present a unique challenge. Combat tasks typically focus on the defeat of an enemy \nforce, stability task focus on the people. In setting the tone for planning, the commander provides the \nfollowing: \nHis understanding of the people, the area, and his forces.\nHis intent and planning guidance.\nHis concept of operations.\n4-25. The commander’s understanding of the OE ultimately determines the appropriate combination of \nstability and defeat mechanisms necessary to achieve the desired end state. The stability and defeat \nmechanisms are not limited to combat tasks but can rely on the perceptions that security forces make on the \nlocal population. At times, military forces intervene in an unstable situation where the security environment \nis actively violent in nature. In these cases, military forces may initially use defeat mechanisms to alter the \nconditions sufficiently to protect the civil populace. In a relatively benign environment where military \nforces primarily assist or facilitate civil efforts, the stability mechanisms will dominate. \n4-26. Challenges for the Stryker Infantry rifle company are the mix of partnered, joint, and combined tasks \nduring operations focused on stability. Mission command requires the ability to clearly communicate intent \nwith security forces, HN government, and other nongovernment organizations (NGOs) for focused efforts \nand direction. \nStability \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 4-5 THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING CULTURE  \n4-27. Soldiers derive their effectiveness from their ability to understand and work with foreign \ncounterparts from another culture. They need to understand enough of their own culture and their \ncounterpart’s culture to accurately convey ideas, concepts, and purpose without causing counterproductive \nconsequences. Soldiers need to be aware of aspects of the local culture and history that influence behavior \nin their operational environment. Soldiers need to understand the reasons and motivations underlying \npersonal interaction and practice patience when working with their counterparts. Group norms guide \nindividual behavior, and Soldiers need to understand how individuals in a society tend to interact as \nmembers of a group, whether a race, ethnic, or kinship group. Cultural understanding is not derived from \ndemographic information provided to the military through country briefs prior to deployment. It is gained \nfrom studying, interacting, and understanding the people, religion, history, customs, and social and political \nstructures within an area. For true understanding, it is necessary to live among the people, gradually \nunderstanding the subtleties and nuances of their culture. Leaders in the SBCT Infantry rifle company \nensures that Soldiers understand that the actions of one can have a positive or negative effect in the way \nthat the entire unit is viewed by the local population. (Refer to ATP 3-07.10 for more information.) \nMOVEMENT AND  MANEUVER \n4-28. Maneuver in stability environments continue to emphasize security over wide areas and in combined, \njoint, and partnered maneuver. Engagement skills (negotiation, rapport building, cultural awareness, and \ncritical language phrases) are tools that leaders use during movement and maneuver to engage the local \npopulation. The intent is to create a stable environment that allows peace to take hold while ensuring the \nforce is protected. Movement in operations focused on stability tasks is very deliberate. Time is the limiting \nfactor due to the slow pace that security forces take; not just for their protection but also to be seen by the \nlocal population and influence their perception. Security patrols often take longer during stability tasks to \nallow the security force to vary their patterns, arrive at destinations in a timely manner to account for \ncontingencies, and have leaders engage the local population. \n4-29. The Stryker Infantry rifle company cannot provide security at all times and all places during wide \narea security tasks. Constant observation will be conducted by the local population and threat forces. A \nblend of covert and overt operations should be conducted to effectively provide wide areas security. \nINTELLIGENCE \n4-30. Intelligence plays an important role in the SBCT Infantry rifle c ompany’s accomplishment of a task. \nThe commander uses every element available to collect information that helps him accomplish his mission. \nEvery member of the company plays a role in gathering information to support the SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany. Details of information from patrols should be collected from every member that participated. The \ninformation collected needs to be cross referenced, analyzed, and shared. The COIST manages the \ninformation collection effort to ensure every member of the company understands the information required \nand plays an active role in the collection of that information. This information is shared and analyzed by the \nS-2 to form intelligence. (Refer to Chapter 1 for more information on the COIST).  \n4-31. Interaction amongst the civilian population provides the greatest amount of information during \nstability tasks. Soldiers should interact with the civilian population according to the commanders PIR, and \nthemes and messages to collect information. \nFIRES \n4-32. Although fire support planning for operations focused on stability is the same as for the offense and \nthe defense the use of fire support may be restricted and limited. The commander integrates fire support \ninto his tactical plan. Special considerations include the following: \nProcedures for the rapid clearance of fires.\nClose communication and coordination with HN officials.\nIncreased security for indirect firing positions.\nRestricted use of certain munitions such as dual-purpose improved conventional munitions\n(DPICM), area denial artillery munition (ADAM), or remote antiarmor mine (RAAM).\nChapter 4 \n4-6 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016Presence of noncombatants.\nProtected s tructures.\n4-33. The need for precision fires is greater in stability tasks. The need to destroy only the designated \ntarget with minimal collateral damage often makes our A rmy’s technological and heavy weapons a \ndisadvantage. The use of advanced precision fires from mortars, snipers, RWS, and MGS assists in \nmitigation of the physical collateral damage and communicating to the local population that every measure \nwas taken to engage only the threat to preserve their safety. \nSUSTAINMENT \n4-34. The OE the SBCT Infantry rifle company operates in during stability tasks may be austere, creating \nspecial sustainment considerations. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: \nReliance on local procurement of certain items.\nAerial resupply of certain classes and may include airlifted rotary-wing cargo sling loads and\nfixed-wing air drops.\nEnsure health service support and Class VIII supply and resupply operations meet unit\noperational support demands.\nShortages of various critical items, to include repair parts, Class IV supply materials, and\nlubricants.\nSpecial Class V supply requirements (such as nonlethal munitions).\nReliance on bottled water.\nClass IV supplies for construction of fixed OPs and checkpoints.\nUse of facilities or new construction for quarters; water, sewer, and power utilities; and\nreinforced hardstand areas for maintenance.\nBarriers or berms to protect ammunition and fuel.\nBiometric identity data vetting of locally employed personnel (LEPs) and other HN support.\n4-35. An FSC in the SBCT BSB is task-organized to the Infantry battalion to provide support. The \ncompany XO should be in direct contact with elements of the FSC and BSB, and the Infantry battalion S-4 \nto coordinate logistics. The 1SG oversees the arrival, security, and distribution to the Stryker Infantry rifle \ncompany. The company supply sergeant consolidates, orders, and accounts for all supply requests. These \nrequests should come from the platoon sergeants and section NCOICs and reviewed by the commander to \nensure that they are able to continue operations. \nPROTECTION \n4-36. Protection of the force during stability tasks is essential for success at all levels. Frequent interaction \nbetween U.S. forces and the local population make protection planning difficult and essential. Adversaries \noften blend in with the local populace in stability environments and are difficult to identify, making \nheightened levels of awareness the norm. SBCT leaders should understand that they will be in close \nproximity of the local population and potential threat but will have difficulty distinguishing between them. \nTechniques for protection during operations focused on stability tasks vary in their application but can \ninclude attempts to identify threats through heightened awareness, cultural understanding, local \nengagements to gain information, personal security for leaders, searches of locals, and biometric identity \ndata collection. \n4-37. The close proximity of civilians and Soldiers can also promote health issues (such as communicable \ndisease) through close contact with local civilians, detainees, or local foods. Force health protection \nconsiderations positively support and promote the health of Soldiers in the OE. The protection of civil \ninstitutions, processes, and systems needed to reach the end state conditions can often be the most decisive \nfactor in stability tasks because its accomplishment is essential for long-term success. Civilian areas \ntypically contain structured and prepared routes, roadways, and avenues that can canalize traffic. This can \nlead to predictable friendly movement patterns that can easily be templated by the enemy. An additional \nplanning consideration during stability tasks is to protect the force while using the minimum force \nStability \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 4-7 consistent with the approved ROE. Additional protection considerations during stability tasks include the \nfollowing: \nReducing the unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO) and mine threat in the AO.\nFratricide and friendly fire prevention and minimizing escalation of force incidents through\ncombat, civilian, and multinational identification measures.\nDeveloping rapid and efficient personnel recovery techniques and drills.\nClear OPSEC procedures that account for the close proximity of civilians, NGOs, and\ncontractors.\nDisciplined information management techniques to preserve access to computer networks.\nContainment of toxic chemicals and materials present in the civilian environment.\nSurvivability requirements for static facilities, positions, or outposts.\n4-38. Commanders implement appropriate security measures to protect the force. Establishment of \ncheckpoints, effective base camp security procedures, and aggressive patrolling are examples of protecting \nthe force. Protecting the force requires special consideration in stability environments. This is because \nthreats may be different and, in some cases, opposing forces seek to kill or wound U.S. forces and allies, or \ndestroy or damage property.  \n4-39. Commanders always consider the aspects of security and how they relate to the ROE. Some \nexamples of protective measures are as follows: \nSecure the inside perimeter following the HN to secure the outside perimeter.\nAvoid predictability by changing routines.\nInclude security in each plan, SOP, OPORD, and movement order.\nDevelop specific security programs such as threat awareness and OPSEC.\nRestrict access of unassigned personnel (verified through biometric identify data) to the unit ’s \nlocation.\nConstantly maintain an image of professionalism and readiness.\nBase the degree of security established on a continuous threat assessment.\nSECTION III – ADDITIONAL TASKS \n4-40. During operations focused on stability tasks, military forces provide support to facilitate the \nexecution of tasks for which the HN is normally responsible. Typically, these tasks have a security \ncomponent ideally performed by military forces. However, military forces sometimes provide logistic, \nmedical, or administrative support to enable the success of civilian agencies and organizations. Tasks that \nthe SBCT Infantry rifle company performs in stability tasks generally falls into one of three categories. The \nfollowing represents the collective effort associated with a stability mission: \nTasks for which military forces retain primary responsibility.\nTasks for which civilian agencies or organizations likely retain responsibility, but military\nforces are prepared to execute.\nTasks for which civilian agencies or organizations retain primary responsibility.\nAREA SECURITY \n4-41. Area security preserves the commander ’s ability to help establish political, legal, social, and \neconomic institutions while supporting the transition to legitimate HN governance. When conducting an \narea security mission, the SBCT Infantry rifle company prevents threat elements from causing instability in \notherwise safe and secure environments. \n4-42. The commander may direct his subordinate platoons to employ a variety of techniques such as OPs, \nTCPs, sniper team employment, BPs, ambushes, mounted and dismounted (or a combination of both) \npatrols, searches and combat outposts to accomplish this security mission. A reserve or quick reaction force \n(QRF) enables the commander to react to unforeseen contingencies. Using the assigned UAS and the \ninformation collection capability available to the SBCT Infantry battalion, the SBCT Infantry Rifle \nChapter 4 \n4-8 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016Company can execute missions proactively with greater precision. (See Chapter 5 for more information on \narea security.) \nSECURITY FORCE ASSISTANCE \n4-43. Security force assistance (SFA) is the unified action to generate, employ, and sustain local, HN, or \nregional security forces in support of a legitimate authority. It is integral to successful operations focused \non stability and extends to all security forces. Forces are developed to operate across the range of military \noperations —combating internal threats such as insurgency, subversion, and lawlessness; defending against \nexternal threats; or serving as multinational partners in other areas. SFA at the SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany may conduct the following: advice, teach/coach, mentor, and augment. (Refer to FM 3-22 for \nmore information.) \nADVISE  \n4-44. Advisors sent to elements below battalion level help foreign counterparts analyze the mission and \ncommander’s intent from higher headquarters. They assist foreign security force (FSF) leaders restate the \nmission, conduct an initial risk assessment, identify a tentative decisive point, and define their own intent. \nThey assist their foreign counterparts to analyze the mission variables. From these variables, advisors help \ntheir foreign counterparts to develop a COA that meets the higher headquarters concept of operations and \ncommander’s intent. Fi nally, they advise and assist in the conduct of operations and the flow of information \nto the FSF higher commander. \nTEACH /COACH  \n4-45. Teaching and coaching includes training and education. Methods of teaching may include classroom \nlectures, seminars, hands-on training, training exercises, and simulations. The commander of the advising \nunit begins with a training assessment of training plans designed during predeployment and passed on from \nthe preceding U.S. units conducted in coordination with the FSF commander. This assessment is important \nto evaluate the FSF and establish and enhance the working relationship between U.S. and FSF. The training \nassessment should cover all aspects of leadership, training, and sustainment. \n4-46. Coaching relies on guiding to bring out and enhance capabilities already present. Coaching refers to \nthe function of helping someone through a set of tasks. The coach helps them understand their established \nlevel of performance and instructs them how to reach the next level of knowledge and skill. Coaching \nrequires identifying short- and long-term goals and devising a plan to achieve those goals. The coach and \nthe person being coached discuss strengths, weaknesses, and a COA to sustain strengths or improve their \nweaknesses. \nMENTOR  \n4-47. Mentorship is a combination of teach, coach and advise. The SBCT Infantry rifle company \ndemonstrates, at all times, what they have taught, coached, and advised to the FSF. Mentors should be \naware of the foreign unit’s experience and capabilities and carefully choose opportu nities to inject or impart \nknowledge. Foreign units are most receptive to mentors that teach unobtrusively.  \nAUGMENT  \n4-48. Augmenting is an arrangement where FSFs and U.S. units exchange or combine with one another. \nAugmentation improves the interdependence and interoperability of U.S. and foreign security forces. \nAugmentation can occur at many levels and in many different forms. For example, a U.S. squad can be \naugmented with HN individuals, a U.S. company can be augmented with a HN platoon, or a FSF battalion \ncan be augmented with a company from a U.S. unit. Similarly, augmentation can be of short duration for a \nspecific mission or of a longer duration for an enduring operation.  \nSECTION IV – TRANSITIONS \n4-49. Transitions mark a change between phases or between the ongoing set of tasks and execution of a \nbranch or sequel. Shifting priorities between the elements of decisive action —such as from the offense to \noperations focused on stability tasks —involves a transition. Transitions require planning and preparation \nStability \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 4-9 well before their execution to maintain the momentum and tempo. The force can be vulnerable during \ntransitions, and commanders establish clear conditions for their execution. Transitions may create \nunexpected opportunities. They may make forces vulnerable to enemy threats.  \nTRANSITION TO THE OFFENSE \n4-50. During an operation focused on stability tasks there may be instances where units quickly transition \nback to operations focused on offensive tasks against irregular forces or defensive tasks to defeat \ncounterattacks. To facilitate the transition, commanders consider an offensive contingency while \nconducting operation focused on stability tasks. They consider how to generate combat power quickly to \ntake the initiative. It can come from organic, partnered, joint and HN forces depending on the situation. \nTRANSITION TO THE DEFENSE \n4-51. Commanders ensure that transitions from defensive tasks to stability tasks and vice versa are \nplanned. For example, it may be tactically wise for commanders to plan a defensive contingency if there is \na significant global, national, or regional event that negatively affects the AO. Transitioning to a defense \nshould not negate the progress made during stability tasks. It should be a temporary change made until the \ninitiative can be regained or until the host nation can assume responsibility. \n4-52. The conditions for transitioning from stability to a retrograde normally occur during transformation \nor fostering stability phases. This is most likely when an intended political outcome is aimed at the \ninfluen ce of the military’s and security forces presence. The SBCT Infantry rifle company will most likely \nsupport a withdrawal or a retirement as part of a larger force. Most likely it will provide security as \npersonnel, equipment, and property and moved out of the host nation. Property accountability will require \nthe coordination and clarification for items on various property books and supply chain issues. \nTRANSFER OF AUTHORITY \n4-53. Stability tasks include transitions of authority and control between military forces, civilian agencies \nand organizations, and the HN. Each transition involves inherent risk. Transitions are identified as decisive \npoints on lines of effort. They typically mark a significant shift in effort and signify the gradual return to \ncivilian oversight and control of the HN. \n4-54. Often during stability missions’  relief in place (RIP) or transfer of authority (TOA) occurs. Besides \nthe normal responsibilities of a relief, commanders deal with civilians or multinational partners. During \nstability tasks, units generally know whether they will be relieved at the end of their tour. Planning for the \nTOA begins as soon as the unit occupies the AO. \n4-55. Before the TOA, the departing unit develops a continuity book with the necessary intelligence on the \nAO. The book should include lessons learned, details about the populace, village, and patrol reports, \nupdated maps, and photographs; anything that helps newcomers master the SBCT Infantry rifle company \nOE. SBCT Infantry units should be familiar with their incoming counterparts particularly if it is a different \norganization that could include mechanized or light infantry or other foreign or North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization (NATO) units. Clear articulation of unit organization skills and OE will help the incoming \nunit identify needs and gaps distinguishing between the different units. Commanders should ensure that \nthese continuity books are updated during the unit’s tour of duty. This extensive effort reduces casualties \nand increase the established and succeeding units’ eff iciency and knowledge of operations. \n4-56. A consistent theme from recent operations is the importance of the transition training (right seat/left \nseat rides) with incoming Soldiers during TOA. A detailed and programmed TOA allows Soldiers to learn \nthe culture and effectively work with HN personnel during the deployment. Typical training during the \nrelief includes the following: \nUse of AO unique equipment not available before TOA.\nEnemy TTPs for IEDs.\nPersonal meetings with NGOs, contractors, interpreters, informants, and local police that\noperate in the unit AO.\nNegotiation techniques with local tribal, religious, and government officials.\nOperations and intelligence handover of databases, plans, products, and briefings.\nChapter 4 \n4-10 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016Information collection procedures, processes, and policies.\nTRANSITION TO CIVILIAN/HOST NATION SECURITY FORCE \nCONTROL \n4-57. During long-term SFA, conditions on the ground, not time, determine the transfer of authority from \nU.S. forces control or partnership, to host-nation control. The overall authority for the handoff and the \nsubsequent transfer of authority lies with the commander ordering the change. The authority for \ndetermining the handoff process lies with the incoming commander assuming responsibility for the \nmission. This changeover process may affect conditions under which the mission will continue. (Refer to \nFM 3-07, ATP 3-07.10, and FM 3-22 for more information.) \n4-58. Changes in the OE such increased attacks, significant destabilization with the infrastructure or \npeople, culturally impacting events inside or outside the OE or development of security forces may require \nreshaping force packages as situations change. Internal administrative concerns might prompt or support \nthe commander’s decision to rotate units. Mission handoff is necessary and define d as the process of \npassing an ongoing mission from one unit to another with no discernible loss of continuity. \n4-59. Commanders make specific considerations along with METT-TC when making a handoff to a \nmultinational force. For units relieved of a function by a government agency, procedures typically entail \nlonger handoff times and more complex coordination. Outgoing units that have past, present, or future \nprojects planned with agencies prepare to transfer these projects to responsible agents in the incoming unit.  \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 5-1 Chapter 5 \nSustainment \nSustainment  is the provision of the logistics, personnel services, and health service \nsupport necessary to maintain operations until successful mission completion \n(ADP 4 -0). In the SBCT Infantry rifle company, the commander has the ultimate \nresponsibility for sustainment. The XO and the 1SG are the company’s primary \nsustainment operators; they work closely with the SBCT Infantry battalion staff to \nensure they receive the required support for the compan y’s assigned operations.  \nSECTION I – SUSTAINMENT FUNCTIONS \n5-1. The sustainment warfighting function is the related tasks and systems that provide support and \nservices to ensure freedom of action, extend operational reach, and prolong endurance (ADRP 3-0). The \nsustainment warfighting function includes the following tasks: \nConduct logistics.\nProvide personnel services.\nProvide health service support.\n5-2. The SBCT Infantry rifle company plans, prepares, and executes its portion of the SBCT Infantry \nbattalion sustainment plan. Concurrent with other operational planning, the company develops its \nsustainment plan during the mission analysis and refines it in the war-gaming portion of the troop-leading \nprocess. Rehearsals are normally conducted at both battalion and SBCT Infantry rifle company levels to \nensure the company receives a smooth, continuous flow of materiel and services. \n5-3. The SBCT Infantry rifle company’s basic sustainment responsibilities are to report or request support \nrequirements through the correct battalion channels. The SBCT Infantry battalion is assigned a forward \nsupport company and from the BSB that is task organized to support their anticipated logistical \nrequirements based on mission variables. The XO and 1SG manage sustainment requirement and logistical \ncoordination with guidance and oversight provided by the commander. At the company level the \nsustainment assets include two family of medium tactical vehicles (FMTVs) with trailers and one attached \nmedical evacuation vehicle (MEV) with an ambulance squad from the medical platoon. They require \naccurate personnel and logistical reports, along with other necessary information and requests to sustain the \ncompany. \nCONDUCT LOGISTICS \n5-4. Logistics  is planning and executing the movement and support of forces (ADRP 4-0). For the SBCT \nInfantry rifle company, logistics may involve aspects of supply, field services, maintenance, transportation, \ndistribution, operational contract support, and general engineering support.  \nSUPPLY AND FIELD SERVICES  \n5-5. The general classes of resupply operations are routine, emergency, or prestock. The company’s SOP \nspecifies cues and procedures for each method resupply, which the battalion may choose to conduct. The \nSBCT Infantry rifle company carries 72 hours of supply on hand for offense, defense, and stability tasks. \nThe actual method selected for resupply in the field depends on METT-TC factors and is according to the \nneed to replenish a 72 hours of supplies. This allows the subordinate units to carry enough supply to \noperate for extended periods of time but not inhibit offense, defense, and stability tasks.  \nChapter 5 \n5-2 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  5-6. Supplies are divided into 10 major categories, which are referred to as classes — \nClass I, Food, rations, and water.\nClass II, Clothing.\nClass III, Petroleum, oil, and lubricants.\nClass IV, Fortification and barrier materials.\nClass V, Ammunition.\nClass VI, Personal items.\nClass VII, Major end items.\nClass VIII, Medical supplies.\nClass IX, Repair parts.\nClass X, Materiel to support nonmilitary program.\nNote . There are a few items that do not fit into any of the 10 supply classes, they are categorized \nas miscellaneous.  \nMAINTENANCE  \n5-7. The nature of the modern battlefield demands that the maintenance system that is flexible and \nresponsive, and focused on returning systems to operational status quickly and as near as possible to the \npoint of failure or damage. This requirement implies a forward thrust of maintenance into the SBCT area. \nMaintenance assets move as far forward as the tactical situation permits to return inoperable and damaged \nequipment to the battle as quickly as possible.  \n5-8. The FSC assigned to the SBCT Infantry Battalion has a combat field maintenance section and a \nmaintenance control section. The field maintenance sections perform repairs as far forward as possible, \nreturning equipment to the battle quickly. During combat, they perform battle damage assessment and \nrepair (BDAR), diagnostics, and on-system replacement of line replaceable units. If the tactical situation \npermits, they focus on completing jobs on site. Field maintenance sections carry limited on board combat \nspares to facilitate repairs forward. Examples include repair and component replacement on tactical \nwheeled vehicles, power generation equipment, and weapon systems. \n5-9. SBCT field maintenance is performed by the field maintenance company and the FSCs. The field \nmaintenance company in the BSB provides field maintenance support for the SBCT units not supported by \nan FSC and supports FSCs for low density equipment items such as armament, electronics, allied trades, \nand ground support equipment. The field maintenance company provides lift capabilities for the repair \nshops, recovery of organic equipment, and recovery to supported units, and support of maintenance \nevacuation. The FSCs provide similar field maintenance support to the infantry battalion. \nField and Sustainment Maintenance \n5-10. Field maintenance is generally characterized by on (or near) system maintenance, often using line \nreplaceable unit and component replacement, battle damage assessment, repair and recovery. Field level \nmaintenance is not limited to remove and replace, but also provides adjustment, alignment, service and \nfault/failure diagnoses. Field maintenance is performed at all levels of the Army and most units have at \nleast some organic field level maintenance capability. Sustainment maintenance is characterized by “off \nsystem” component repair or “repair and return to supply system” and can be employed at any point in the \nintegrated logistics chain. Field maintenance is always repair and return to the user and includes \nmaintenance actions performed by operators. \n5-11. Sustainment maintenance is off-system component repair and end item repair and return or both to \nthe supply system or by exception to the owning unit, performed by national level maintenance providers. \nThe intent of sustainment maintenance is to perform off-system repairs on all supported items to a standard \nthat provides a consistent and measurable level of reliability.  \nSustainment \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 5-3 TRANSPORTATION AND DISTRIBUTION  \n5-12. The BSB distribution company and FSCs have transportation capability and are used to distribute \nsupplies within the SBCT. The transportation platoon provides within the distribution company transports \nsupplies to the FSCs. The transportation platoon headquarters provides leadership, supervision and \ntechnical guidance to tactical truck squads performing motor transport operations to SBCT units. The \ntransportation platoon executes missions when ordered by the company or BSB. The FSC distribution \nsection has transportation assets to distribute supplies to the supported SBCT Infantry battalion. (Refer to \nATP 4-11 for more information.) \nOPERATIONAL CONTRACT SUPPORT  \n5-13. Contractors and Department of the Army civilians are playing an ever-increasing role in providing \nsustainment to military forces. The battalion may use contractors to bridge gaps between required \ncapabilities and actual force structure available within an AO. Contractors may be employed, subject to \nMETT-TC, throughout the AO and in virtually all conditions. Protecting contractors on the battlefield is the \nbattalion commander’s responsibility. When contractors are expected to perform in potentially hostile \nareas, the supported military forces assure the protection of their operations and personnel which can \ninclude coordination with contracted security firms and other military or paramilitary forces. \nGENERAL ENGINEERING SUPPORT\n5-14. General engineering provides support that enables logistics. Engineers units from outside the SBCT \ncombine and apply capabilities from three engineer disciplines (combat, general, and geospatial \nengineering) to establish and maintain the infrastructure necessary for sustaining military operations. This \ninvolves general engineering tasks that consist of building, repairing, and maintaining roads, bridges, \nairfields, port facilities, and other structures as well as reinforcing force protection measures. Other tasks \nalso include the planning, acquisition, management, remediation and disposition of real estate, supplying \nmobile electric power, utilities and waste management, environmental support, diving and firefighting (see \nATP 3-34.40). \nPROVIDE PERSONNEL SERVICES \n5-15. Personnel services are sustainment functions that man and fund the force. It also maintains Soldier \nreadiness, promotes moral and ethical values, and enables the fighting qualities of the Army (ADRP 4-0). It \nincludes essential personnel services such as evaluations, leaves and passes, awards and decorations, rest \nand recuperation, postal, personnel accountability, casualty operations, and personnel management. \nPersonnel services include the following functions and are provided by the battalion’s personnel staff \nofficer (S-1) , the SBCT’s brigade legal section, and the unit ministry team.  \nHuman resources. (Refer to FM 1-0.)\nFinancial management. (Refer to FM 1-06.)\nLegal support. (Refer to FM 1-04.)\nReligious support. (Refer to FM 1-05.)\nHUMAN RESOURCES SUPPORT  \n5-16. Human resources support all functions that affect the Soldier’s status, readiness, and welfare. It \nincludes essential personnel services such as evaluations, leaves and passes, awards and decorations, rest \nand recuperation, postal, personnel accountability, casualty operations, and personnel information \nmanagement. \nPOSTAL SERVICES  \n5-17. The battalion mail clerk receives and distributes Soldier mail to the company mail clerk, usually the \nsupply sergeant, who delivers it to the 1SG, PSG, or to the Soldier. All outgoing and returned mail is given \nto the supply sergeant or 1SG during resupply, and is turned over to the S-1 section when the LOGPAC \nreturns to the field trains. \nChapter 5 \n5-4 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT /STRENGTH REPORTING  \n5-18. Personnel accounting is the process of recording by-name data on Soldiers when they arrive, depart, \nchange duty location, or change duty status. Strength reporting is the numerical end product of the by-name \naccounting process. 1SGs are critical participants in this process. They need to be sensitive to the accuracy \nand timeliness of all personnel accounting reports. They should pay special attention to Soldiers who have \nchanged status in the medical treatment process and task organization changes when they submit their \nreports. \nCASUALTY OPERATIONS  \n5-19. Casualty operations include production, dissemination, coordination, validation, and synchronization \nof information regarding each casualty. This information includes casualty reporting, casualty notification, \ncasualty assistance, line-of-duty determination, disposition of remains, and disposition of personal effects, \nmilitary burial honors, and casualty mail coordination. \nUnit Reporting \n5-20. As casualties occur, the nearest observer informs the company 1SG via the most expedient method \navailable (for example free text within FBCB2, FM voice). The 1SG submits a personnel status report \n(PERSTAT) to the SBCT Infantry battalion S-1 section. This report documents duty status changes on all \ncasualties. Casualties are taken to the CCP for classification of injury type (routine, urgent, return to duty), \nevacuation, and integration into the medical treatment system. The 1SG ensures completed DA Form 1156 \n(Casualty Feeder Card ) is forwarded to the SBCT Infantry battalion S-1, who then enters the data into the \ndefense casualty information processing system (DCIPS). \n5-21. Commanders and their 1SGs need to establish procedures to ensure that the Soldier’s next of kin are \nnotified properly and according to procedure. The potential for unofficial communications that exist with \nkilled in action (KIA) operations also exist in casualty operations. That is, the use of cell phones and \ncomputers near the AO enables many Soldiers to contact his home station regarding the casualty —such \ncommunication is unofficial and unacceptable. The next of kin for Soldiers wounded or KIA should not \nreceive notification through unofficial means. There is usually a communication blackout until the next of \nkin is notified. No internet or phone calls home are permitted. \nMedical/Personnel Accounting \n5-22. When a Soldier becomes a casualty, the platoon combat medic or emergency care sergeant records \nthe medical treatment the Soldier receives on the Soldier’s DD Form 1380  (Tactical Combat Casualty Care \n(TCCC) Card ). The BAS and brigade support medical company (BSMC) read the Soldier’s DD Form 1380 \nwhen they treat the Soldier. The SBCT Infantry battalion S-1 should electronically receive a notification \nmessage to update the Soldier’s patient track ing status. In turn, this message should be forwarded to the \ncompany. This way, a casualty’s location can be determined and Soldiers properly accounted for by the \ncompany. \n5-23. Sustainment planning is fully integrated into all operational planning, with the concept of \nsustainment support synchronized with the concept of operations. Planning is continuous and ongoing. Key \nsustainment planners are the XO, the 1SG, and the supply NCO who actively need to participate in the \nplanning process. The company SOP should be the basis for sustainment operations, with planning \nconducted to determine specific requirements and to prepare for contingencies. Company orders should \naddress specific operation support matters. Deviations from the sustainment SOP should be covered early \nin the planning process. In some situations, sustainment planning begins before receipt of the mission, as \npart of the ongoing process of refining the sustainment estimate. Sustainment planners need to understand \nthe mission statement, commander’s inten t, and concept of operations to provide effective support. \nDEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANY SUSTAINMENT PLAN \n5-24. The SBCT Infantry rifle company commander develops his sustainment plan by first determining \nexactly what supplies he has on hand and then estimating his support requirements. If equipped with \nFBCB2, the commander can review his commander’s track item list (CTIL) and verify his supply status. \nHe uses available information from his mission analysis and from war-gaming to aid his sustainment plan \nSustainment \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 5-5 development. This process is important not only in confirming the validity of the sustainment plan but also \nin ensuring that the company’s support requests are submitted early.  \n5-25. The commander can formulate his sustainment execution plan and submit support requests based on \nthe results of his TLP. The sustainment plan should answer a variety of operational questions, such as — \nBased on the nature of the operation and specific tactical factors, what types of support will the\nSBCT Infantry rifle company need?\nIn which quantities will this support be required? The discussion should answer the following\nquestions:\nWill emergency resupply be required during the operation?\nDoes this operation require prestock supplies?\nWhat are the composition, disposition, and capabilities of the expected enemy threat and how\nwill this affect sustainment during the operation? The discussion should answer the following\nquestions:\nWhere and when will the expected contact occur?\nBased on the nature and location of expected contact, what are the SBCT Infantry rifle\ncompany’s expected casualties and vehicle losses?\nWhat impact will the enemy’s special weapons capabilities (such as CBRN) have on the\noperation and on expected sustainment requirements?\nHow many EPWs/detainees are expected and where?\nHow will terrain and weather affect sustainment operations during the operation? The\ndiscussion should answer the following questions:\nWhat ground will provide optimum security for the trains?\nWhat ground will provide optimum security for maintenance and CCPs?\nWhat are the SBCT Infantry rifle company’s MEDEVAC LZs and CASEVAC routes?\nWhat are the company’s “dirty” routes for evacuation of contaminated personnel, vehicles,\nand equipment?\nWhen and where will the SBCT Infantry rifle company need sustainment? The discussion\nshould answer the following questions:\nBased on the nature and location of expected contact, which sites are the best for the\nmaintenance collection points?\nBased on the nature and location of expected contact, which sites are the best for the CCPs?\nWhere will the EPWs/detainees collection points be located?\nWhich logistics release point (LRPs) will be active during the operation? When will they be\nactive?\nWhat are the criteria and triggers for the movement of the company combat trains?\nWhat are the support priorities (by element and type of support)? The discussion should answer\nthe following questions:\nDoes each platoon have a pathfinder qualified person to establish a hasty LZ for\nMEDEVAC?\nWhere can I place the MEV to CASEVAC the most casualties with minimal impact on\ncombat power?\nWhich platoon has priority for emergency Class III resupply?\nWhich platoon has priority for emergency Class V resupply?\nShould the FMTV be loaded with the emergency supplies or should it be empty in case of\nmass casualty (MASCAL) or EPW transportation?\nWill there be lulls in the operation that will permit support elements to conduct resupply\noperations in relative safety? If no lulls are expected, how can the SBCT Infantry rifle company\nbest minimize the danger to the sustainment vehicles?\nBased on information developed during the sustainment planning process, which resupply\ntechnique should be used?\nChapter 5 \n5-6 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  SECTION II – SUSTAINMENT RESPONSIBILITIES AND SUPPORTING UNITS \n5-26. The discussion below is an expansion of the duties, responsibilities, and units described in chapter \n1. \nEXECUTIVE OFFICER \n5-27. The XO is the SBCT Infantry rifle company’s primary sustainment planner and coordinator, \nreporting directly to the commander. During preparations for the operation, he works closely with the 1 SG \nto determine specific support requirements of the tactical plan. He then ensures that proper arrangements \nare made to provide those support requirements. The XO also performs these logistical functions: \n Determines the location of the company’s resupply point based on data developed during\noperational planning.\n Compiles DA Form 5988-E/DA Form 2404 ( Equipment Inspection and Maintenance\nWorksheet , available through the property book unit supply enhanced (PBUSE) system) from\nthe platoon leaders, platoon sergeants (PSGs), and the 1SG and provides updates to the\ncommander, as required.\n Along with the 1SG, ensures that the SBCT Infantry rifle company executes sustainment\noperations according to the SBCT Infantry battalion plan.\n Leads the SBCT Infantry rifle company sustainment rehearsal in cooperation with the company\n1SG.\n Assists the commander in developing sustainment priorities and guidance according to the\nSBCT Infantry battalion concept of support and enforces those priorities.\n Conducts close coordination with the battalion operation staff officer (S-3) and logistics staff\nofficer (S-4) for planning and resourcing company missions.\n Manages all of the company commander’s property books.\nFIRST SERGEANT \n5-28. The 1SG is the senior NCO and the most experienced Soldier in the company. He is the \ncommander ’s primary tactical advisor and the expert on individual and NCO skills. He assists the \ncommander in planning, coordinating, and supervising all activities that support the unit mission. He \noperates where the commander directs or where his duties require him. His specific duties include the \nfollowing: \nExecutes and supervises routine operations. This includes enforcing the TACSOP, planning and\ncoordinating training, coordinating and reporting personnel and administrative actions, and\nsupervising supply, maintenance, communications, field hygiene, and MEDEVAC operations.\nSupervises, inspects, or observes matters designated by the commander. (For example, he\nobserves and reports on a portion of the company ’s AO or zone, inspects the mortar section, or\ninspects all range cards.)\nDirects and supervises CASEVAC, ensuring medical assets remain flexible and responsive to\ntactical operations.\nAssists and coordinates with the XO and is prepared to assume the XO’s duties.\nLeads task-or ganized elements or subunits on designated missions.\nProvides an SBCT Infantry rifle company orientation for new personnel and, in consultation\nwith the commander, assigns replacements to the company’s subordinate elements.\nSupervises evacuation of casualties, EPWs, detainees, and damaged equipment.\nDirects and supervises the collection, initial identification, and evacuation of human remains to\nthe mortuary affairs collection point (MACP).\nMaintains the SBCT Infantry rifle company battle roster.\nSustainment \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 5-7 SUPPLY SERGEANT \n5-29. The supply sergeant, or his supply clerk, is the SBCT Infantry rifle company’s representative to the \nSBCT Infantry battalion S-4. The supply sergeant performs the following logistical functions: \nControls the supply trucks that are organic to the company.\nMonitors the tactical situation and anticipates logistical requirements.\nUses the battalion A/L radio network or their FBCB2  net to communicate with the company.\nCoordinates with the BSB for resupply of Class I, III, and V.\nMaintains individual supply and clothing records, and requisitions Class II resupply.\nRequisitions Class IV and Class VII equipment and supplies.\nPicks up replacement personnel and delivers them to the 1SG.\nReceives and evacuates human remains to the MACP in the brigade support area (BSA).\nTransports, guards, or transfers EPWs and detainees.\nGuides the LOGPAC, along with EPWs, detainees, and damaged vehicles (if applicable), back\nto the BSA.\nCoordinates with the SBCT Infantry battalion S-1 section to turn in or pick up mail and\npersonnel action documents.\nCollects bagged contaminated soil and transports it to collection points as part of LOGPAC\nprocedures.\nMaintains and provides supplies for company field sanitation activities.\nManages commander’s property book and prepares financial liability investigations of property\nloss.\nCOMPANY COMBAT MEDICS \n5-30. Combat medics are assigned to the medical platoon tasked to support the SBCT Infantry battalion. \nCombat medics are allocated to the SBCT Infantry rifle companies on the basis of one combat medic to a \nplatoon, and one emergency care sergeant to a company. The location of the combat medic is of extreme \nimportance for rapid medical treatment of casualties.  \n5-31. The SBCT Infantry rifle platoon combat medic usually locates with, or near, the platoon sergeant . \nThe platoon sergeant determines which element the medic goes with in support of the platoon leaders \nmaneuver plan. He has the option to send him with the Infantry when they dismount the ICV or remain in \nthe ICV to respond to a casualty. When the platoon is mounted, the combat medic usually rides in the same \nvehicle as the PSG. \n5-32. The company emergency care sergeant collocates with the company trains. When a casualty occurs, \nthe combat life saver (CLS) renders first aid, or first aid is provided through self-aid or buddy aid. The \nplatoon combat medic or the company emergency care sergeant then goes to the location of the casualty \nusing tactical combat casualty care procedures in the combat OE. The CCP combat medic makes his \nassessment; administers initial medical care; initiates a DD Form 1380 or DA Form 1156; and then requests \nevacuation or returns the individual to duty. (Refer to Chapter 1, Section III, for additional responsibilities \nof SBCT Infantry rifle company combat medics.) \nFORWARD SUPPORT COMPA NY \n5-33. The BSB of the SBCT has six organic FSCs that are task organized to support the maneuver \nbattalions. The role of the FSC is to provide direct logistics support to the SBCT Infantry battalion. The \nFSC provides the supported commander with dedicated logistics assets organized specifically to meet the \nbattalion’s requirements. The FSC provides field feeding, bulk fuel, general supply, ammunition, and field \nmaintenance. The FSC commander is the senior logistician for the battalion. The FSC commander assists \nthe battalion S4 with the battalion logistics planning and is responsible for executing the logistics plan \nfollowing the BSB and supported battalion commanders’ guidance. The FSC receives supplies and \nmaintenance support for low density equipment from the BSB. The FSC is organized to support — \nFood and water (Class I).\nChapter 5 \n5-8 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016Fuel (Class III).\nAmmunition (Class V).\nRepair parts (Class IX).\nMaintenance and recovery.\nSupply and distribution.\n5-34. Depending on the current operation and situation an FSC may be attached to or placed under \nOPCON of the Infantry battalion. FSC attachment or OPCON to the SBCT Infantry battalion is limited in \nduration and may be for a specific mission or phase of an operation. The FSC may split its capabilities and \nplace some elements of that company in the BSA if the mission dictates this. The FSC normally colocates \nits CP with or near the CTCP. The location of the FSC’s platoons and sections is determined by the \nbattalion commander to support maneuver. (See figure 5 -1) \nLegend:  FLD MAINT = field maintenance , FSC = forward support company, HQ CO = headquarters company, \nREC = recovery, SVC = service \nFigure 5-1. Forward Support Company \nSECTION III – CONDUCT LOGISTICS \n5-35. There are few, if any, contingencies in which U.S. military forces have all the supplies they need for \nan operation. It is essential that every unit’s daily logistical report needs to accurately reflect not only its \noperational needs but also what supplies and equipment are on hand. \n5-36. The general classes of resupply operations are routine, emergency, or prestock. The SBCT Infantry \nrifle company SOP specifies cues and procedures for each method, which the company rehearses during \ncompany training exercises. The actual method selected for resupply in the field depends on METT-TC. \nPLAN \n5-37. Logistics planners adjust standardize sustainment packages, providing all units with sufficient \nquantities of each supply item in anticipation of their requirements. These adjusted packages are based on \nwhat supplies are reported on hand, consumed, and pl anned operations. Together with the commander’s \nguidance for issuance of scarce, but heavily requested supply items, accurate reporting allows planners to \nSustainment \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 5-9 quickly forecast supply constraints and then to submit requisitions to alleviate projected shortages. \nInaccurate or incomplete reporting can severely handicap efforts to balance unit requirements and available \nsupplies. As a result, some units may go into combat without enough supplies to accomplish their mission \nwhile others may have an excess of certain items. \n5-38. The basic load includes supplies that the SBCT Infantry rifle company keeps on its organic support \nvehicles for use in combat. The amount of time the SBCT Infantry rifle company sustains itself in combat \nwithout resupply determines its quantity of supply items.  \n5-39. The higher command or the SOP specifies the Class V basic load. (See table 5-1, figure 5-2, and \nfigure 5-3 on page 5-11 .) \nTable 5-1: Days of Supply Class I, III, and IV \nCLASS (CL) I  CLASS III  CLASS IV  \nIndividual  9 x meals ready to eat \n(MRE) (3 per day)  \n3 x gallons of w ater \n(1 gallon per day)  None  None  \nSquad  99 x MRE (9 cases)  \n33 x gallons of water  \nplus 2 x 5 gallon cans  CL III (P)  \n53 gallon (full fuel tank)  \n2 x 5 gallon fuel cans  \nCL III (B)  \n15w40          2 Quarts  \nDextron III    2 Quart s \nMil 5606   2 Quarts  \n80w90  1 Quart  \nAntifreeze    1 Quart  4 x rolls Concertina wire  \n6 x Picket  \nPlatoon  396 x MRE (36 cases)  \n132 gallon of water plus \n8 x 5 gallon cans  CL III (P) \\ \n212 gallon (full fuel \ntanks)  \n8 x 5 gallon fuel cans  \nCL III ( B) \n15w40           2 gallons  \nDextron III     2 gallons  \nMil 5606  2 gallons  \n80w90      1 gallon  \nAntifreeze  1 gallon  16 x rolls Concertina wire  \n24 x Pickets  \nChapter 5 \n5-10 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  \nLegend:  API = armor-piercing incendiary, APFSDS-T = armor-piercing fin stabilized discarding sabot with \ntracer, ATGM = antitank guided missile, AT = antitank, cal = caliber, CV = combat vehicle, ESV = engineer \nsupport vehicle , FSV = fire support vehicle, HEAT-T = high-explosive antitank tracer , HEP-T = high-explosive \nplastic tracer, ICV = Infantry carrier vehicle, ILLUM = illumination, MCV = mobile construction vehicle, MGS \n= mobile gun system, mm = millimeter, NBCRV = nuclear, biological, chemical reconnaissance vehicle, RV = \nreconnaissance vehicle \nFigure 5-2. Basic load for Stryker Infantry rifle company \nSustainment \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 5-11 5-40. The SBCT Infantry rifle company’s combat load includes the supplies that it carries into the fight. \nThe SBCT Infantry battalion commander dictates minimum requirements; however, the SBCT Infantry \nrifle company commander or the unit SOP specifies most items. Specific combat loads vary by mission \n(See figure 5-3).  \nLegend:  AG = assistant gunner, AR = automatic rifleman, AT SPC = antiarmor specialist, DM = designated \nmarksman, DVR = driver, GREN = grenadier, MG = machine gunner, PL = platoon leader, PLT FO = platoon \nforward officer, PLT MED = platoon medic, PSG = platoon sergeant, RATELO = radio telephone operator, SL \n= squad leader \nFigure 5-3. Infantry combat load \nChapter 5 \n5-12 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016PREPARE \n5-41. Thorough briefings and comprehensive rehearsals are important keys to effective sustainment \nplanning. These activities play a critical role in ensuring that the SBCT Infantry rifle company can execute \nits sustainment plans efficiently. They allow the commander, his subordinate leaders, and each Soldier to \ndiscover potential problem areas and to develop contingency plans to avoid unforeseen difficulties. \n5-42. The commander has several options for conducting sustainment rehearsals. One is to integrate the \nsustainment rehearsal into the unit’s larger maneuver rehearsals. Another  alternative is for the unit’s \nsustainment operators to conduct a separate rehearsal. The SBCT Infantry rifle company commander may \ndirect the XO and 1SG to rehearse sustainment operations with the company’s PSGs, the battalion \nmaintenance team, and battalion medical platoon for vehicle recovery, CASEVAC, or MASCAL. \nExplosive ordnance disposal (EOD) personnel are included when necessary by the mission. \nROUTINE RESUPPLY \n5-43. Routine resupply operations cover items in Classes I, III, V, and IX as well as provide opportunity to \ntransport mail, Soldiers, and other items the SBCT Infantry rifle company requests. When possible, the \nSBCT Infantry rifle company should conduct routine resupply daily, ideally during periods of limited \nvisibility.  Routine resupply breaks should have standard configured packages for 24-, 48-, and 72-hours \nbased on their operations they conduct in the offense, defense, or stability with considerations of the \noperating environment. Common to all packages are Class I specifically water and food, and Class III fuel. \nThese are consumed at the highest rates and must be replenished constantly. \nLOGISTICS PACKAGE OPERATIONS \n5-44. The LOGPAC technique is a simple, efficient way to accomplish routine resupply operations. The \nkey feature is a centrally organized resupply convoy originating at the SBCT Infantry battalion trains. It \ncarries all items needed to sustain the SBCT Infantry rifle company for a specific period, usually 24 hours \nor until the next scheduled LOGPAC. SBCT Infantry rifle company and battalion SOPs specify the exact \ncomposition and march order of the LOGPAC. \n5-45. Normally, the first LOGPAC is configured during preparation phase of the battalions operation in \nBSA. This LOGPAC is loaded and begins movement to the battalion field trains during the execution phase \nof the operation. SBCT Infantry rifle company commanders must be aware that the LOGPAC is configured \nbefore their operation is completed. To resupply specific items through routine resupply can often take 24 \nto 36 hours from ordering to receiving, if the BSB has the item on hand. It will require more time if the \nBSB has to acquire from higher sustainment echelons. \n5-46. The SBCT Infantry rifle company supply sergeant first compiles and coordinates all of the \ncompany’s supply requests with the BSB. H e obtains the following: \nClass I, Class III (bulk and packaged products), and Class V supplies from the BSB. This\nusually entails employment of one or two fuel HEMTT and one or two cargo HEMTTs.\nClass II, Class IV (basic load resupply only), Class VI, and Class VII supplies from SBCT\nInfantry battalion S-4.\nThe battalion aid station receives support for Class VIII from the medical logistics elements\nlocated in the medical company, and HHC of the brigade support battalion. The battalion aid\nstation then pushes required Class VIII to each of the rifle companies during LOGPAC.\nRoutine Class IX supplies and maintenance documents (as required) from the prescribed load\nlist section in the BSB.\nReplacement personnel and Soldiers returning from a medical treatment facility.\nVehicles returning to the SBCT Infantry rifle company area from maintenance.\nMail and personnel action documents (to include awards and finance and legal documents) from\nthe battalion S-1 section.\n5-47. When LOGPAC preparations are completed, the supply sergeant initiates tactical movement to the \nLRP under the supervision of the FSC transportation platoon leader. The supply sergeant and LOGPAC \nlink up with the 1SG at the LRP. \nSustainment \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 5-13 EXECUTE \n5-48. Below are the techniques the SBCT Infantry rifle company uses to execute logistics. \nACTIONS AT THE LOGISTICS RELEASE POINT  \n5-49. When the 1SG or his representative arrives at the LRP to pick up the SBCT Infantry rifle company \nLOGPAC, he updates all personnel and logistical reports. The field trains OIC briefs on changes to the \ntactical or support situation. He then escorts the convoy to the SBCT rifle company resupply point, \nproviding security during movement from the LRP. \nResupply Procedures \n5-50. The time required for resupply is an important planning factor. Units need to conduct resupply \nquickly and efficiently to ensure operational effectiveness, and to allow the SBCT Infantry rifle company \nLOGPAC to return to the LRP on time.  \n5-51. Once the unit completes resupply operations, the unit prepares the LOGPAC vehicles for the return \ntrip. SBCT Infantry rifle company vehicles requiring recovery for maintenance or salvage are lined up and \nprepared for towing. Cargo trucks, fuel trucks, or damaged vehicles transport those killed in action. EPWs \nand detainees ride in the cargo trucks, and are guarded by walking wounded or other company personnel. \nAll supply requests, human resources actions, and outgoing mail are consolidated for forwarding to the \nfield trains, where the appropriate staff section processes them for the next LOGPAC. \n5-52. The 1SG or the supply sergeant leads the LOGPAC back to the LRP, where he links up with the BSB \ntransportation platoon leader. When possible, the reunited task force LOGPAC convoy returns to the field \ntrains together. When METT-TC dictates or when the LOGPAC arrives too late to rejoin the larger convoy, \nthe SBCT Infantry rifle company vehicles need to return to the field trains on their own. Because only \nminimal security assets are available, this situation should be avoided. \nResupply Methods \n5-53. As directed by the commander or XO, the 1SG establishes the SBCT Infantry rifle company’s \nresupply point using the service station method or the tailgate method. He briefs each LOGPAC driver on \nwhich method or methods to use. When the resupply point is ready, the 1SG informs the commander, who \nin turn directs each platoon or element to conduct resupply based on the tactical situation. \nService Station Resupply \n5-54. With the service station method, vehicles move individually or in small groups to a centrally located \nresupply point. Depending on the tactical situation, one vehicle or section, or even an entire platoon, moves \nout of its position, conducts resupply operations, and then moves back into position. This process continues \nuntil the entire SBCT Infantry rifle company has been resupplied. (See figure 5-4.) \n5-55. When using this method, vehicles enter the resupply point following a one-way traffic flow; only \nvehicles requiring immediate maintenance stop at the maintenance holding area. Vehicles move through \neach supply location, with crews rotating individually to eat, pick up mail and sundries, and refill or \nexchange water cans. When all platoon vehicles and crews have completed resupply, they move to a \nholding area where, time permitting, the platoon leader and PSG conduct a precombat inspection (PCI) . \nThe company command group (rifle company commander, XO, and 1SG) can take this opportunity to \nconduct PCIs of each platoon as they pass through the resupply point. \nChapter 5 \n5-14 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  \nLegend:  AMMO = ammunition, EPW = enemy prisoner of war, 1SG = first sergeant , MEV = medical, \nevacuation vehicle \nFigure 5-4. Service station method \nTailgate Resupply \n5-56. Tailgate resupply usually requires much more time than do service station operations. Usually, units \nuse the tailgate method only when the tactical situation allows or dictates. Combat vehicles remain in their \nvehicle positions or back out a short distance to allow trucks carrying Class III and Class V supplies to \nreach them. Individual crewmen rotate through the feeding area, pick up mail and sundries, and fill or \nexchange water cans. Any EPWs and detainees are centralized and guarded. Soldiers KIA and their \npersonal effects are brought to the holding area, where the 1SG takes charge of them. (See figure 5-5 on \npage 5-15 .) \nSustainment \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 5-15 \nLegend:  CO = commander, LOGPAC = logistics package, LRP = logistics release point, PSG = platoon \nsergeant, MGS = mobile gun system \nFigure 5-5. Tailgate resupply method \nCombination of Service Station and Tailgate Resupply \n5-57. The SBCT Infantry rifle company may select to employ the tailgate resupply method, but selected \nplatoons may have to use the service station resupply method. Selected platoon(s) may use the service \nstation resupply method and some sections may have to use the tailgate resupply method. \nEmergency Resupply \n5-58. Occasionally (usually during combat operations), the SBCT Infantry rifle company has such an \nurgent need for resupply that it cannot wait for a routine LOGPAC. Emergency resupply may involve \nClasses III, V, and VIII, and CBRN equipment. On rare occasions, Class I emergency resupply can be \nconducted using either the service station or tailgate method, although procedures may have to be adjusted \nwhen the SBCT Infantry rifle company is in contact with the enemy. In the service station method, \nindividual vehicles pull back during a lull in combat on order of the commander or platoon leader; they \nconduct resupply and then return to the fight. With tailgate resupply, the SBCT Infantry rifle company \nbrings limited supplies forward to the closest concealed position behind each vehicle or element. In case of \nemergency, Class VIII resupply is conducted in concert with the evacuation of casualties/patients or \nthrough the use of push packages. \nChapter 5 \n5-16 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016PREPOSITIONED SUPPLIES  \n5-59. Prepositioning of supplies is most often required in defensive or stability tasks. Usually only Class V \nitems are prepositioned. Class III supplies can be prepositioned. However, this requires SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany vehicles to refuel before moving into fighting positions during initial occupation of the battle \nposition. They may move out of their fighting positions to conduct refueling operations at the rear of the \nBP.  \n5-60. Leaders at every level carefully plan and execute prepositioning supplies. All leaders, down to \nvehicle commander and squad leader, know the exact locations of prestock sites, which they verify during \nreconnaissance or rehearsals. The SBCT Infantry rifle company takes steps to ensure survivability of \nprestock supplies. These measures include digging in prestock positions and selecting covered and \nconcealed positions. The company commander develops a plan to remove or destroy prepositioned supplies \nto prevent the enemy from capturing them. (See figure 5-6 and 5-7 on page 5-17 .) \n5-61. During offensive tasks, leaders can employ mobile pre-positioning loading supplies on trucks and \npositioning them forward in the AO. This technique works well if the SBCT Infantry rifle company expects \nto use a large volume of ammunition during a fast-moving operation. \nFigure 5-6. Prestock resupply operations —Method 1 (central Class V prestock site) \nSustainment \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 5-17 \nFigure 5-7. Prestock resupply operations —Method 2 (Class V prestock site for each vehicle) \nAERIAL DELIVERY  \n5-62. Aerial delivery can be used as a method of resupply (see chapter 6, section IV this publication for \nmore information). The following should be considered: \nThe use of aerial delivery requires the coordination of the SBCT Infantry battalion staff and the\nBCT S-3, S-4, and ADAM/brigade aviation element (BAE) sections. Special reemphasis is\nplaced on the enemy air defense capability.\nAll companies need to know how to select LZ/DZ to receive aerial resupply. The delivered\nsupplies are immediately transported away from the LZ/DZ.\nUnits should return the sling or air delivery equipment to its owning unit.\nChapter 5 \n5-18 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  SECTION IV – MAINTENANCE AND VEHICLE RECOVERY \n5-63. The maintenance of weapons, equipment, and the Stryker vehicle is continuous. Every Soldier needs \nto know how to maintain his weapon, equipment, and perform operator level maintenance on the Stryker \nvehicle according to the related technical manual. The commander, XO, and 1SG need to understand \nmaintenance for every piece of equipment in the company as well as the standard operating procedures of \nthe battalion and SBCT. \nLEVELS OF MAINTENANCE \n5-64. The Army employs the field and sustainment levels of maintenance as described below. \nFIELD MAINTENANCE  \n5-65. Field maintenance is on-system maintenance, and mainly involves preventive maintenance and \nreplacement of defective parts. The goal of field maintenance is to repair and return equipment to the \nSoldier. It covers tasks previously assigned to operator/crew, organization/unit, and direct support \nmaintenance levels. It includes some off-system maintenance critical to mission readiness. \nSUSTAINMENT MAINTENANCE  \n5-66. The company executive officer oversees sustainment maintenance of company headquarters elements \nthat include communications, CBRN, armorer, vehicle maintenance, and supply. He is responsible to \nensure that replacement or defective parts for all equipment are conducted within Army standards. The 1SG \noversees the Soldiers working within the company headquarters to ensure that the Soldiers within the \ncompany have the proper equipment and supplies to perform their tasks. \nRECOVERY \n5-67. Vehicle recovery must be planned as a contingency to an operation. The SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany commander must remain flexible with his maneuver plan to lessen the impact of an inoperative \nvehicle during the execution phase. The leaders of the company should rehearse battle drills to speed in the \nrecovery of the vehicle to continue operations. The Stryker vehicle has the advantage of self-recovery but \noccasionally requires a wrecker.  \n5-68. The techniques with Stryker vehicle recovery are to recover the vehicle to the rear or recover the \nvehicle forward during reorganization and consolidation. The decision is made by the company commander \non which technique to employ and based on METT-TC. Soldiers with the vehicle requiring recovery will \neither stay with the vehicle and assists in its repair or cross level equipment and personnel onto other \nvehicles and continue mission. \nSECTION V – ARMY HEALTH SYSTEM SUPPORT \n5-69. Army Health System support is a component of the Military Health System that is responsible for \noperational management of the health service support and force health protection missions for training, \npredeployment, deployment, and postdeployment operations. Army Health System includes all mission \nsupport services performed, provided, or arranged by the Army Medical Department to support health \nservice support and force health protection requirements for the Army and as directed, for joint, \nintergovernmental agencies, coalition, and multinational forces. This system includes both force health \nprotection and health service support. Force health protection encompasses measures to promote, improve, \nconserve, or restore the mental or physical well-being of Soldiers. These measures enable a healthy and fit \nforce, prevent injury and illness, and protect the force from health hazards. These measures include the \nprevention aspects of a number of Army Medical Department functions (preventive medicine, including \nmedical surveillance and occupational health surveillance; veterinary services, including the food \ninspection and animal care missions, and the prevention of zoonotic disease transmissible to man; combat \nand operational stress control; dental services [preventive dentistry]; and laboratory services [area medical \nlaboratory support]). \nSustainment \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 5-19 5-70. Health service support completes the Army Health System. Health service support encompasses all \nsupport and services performed, provided, or arranged by the Army Medical Department to promote, \nimprove, conserve, or restore the mental and physical well-being of personnel in the Army. Additionally, as \ndirected, provide support in other Services, agencies, and organizations. This includes casualty care \n(encompassing a number of Army Medical Department functions —organic and area medical support, \nhospitalization, and treatment aspects of dental care and behavioral/neuropsychiatric treatment, clinical \nlaboratory services, and treatment chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear patients), medical \nevacuation, and medical logistics. (Refer to FM 4-02 for more information.) \nCASUALTY PROCEDURES  \n5-71. Casualties are an unfortunate part of combat. They can occur at any point during an operation and \nare contingency leaders must prepare for. Before moving a casualty it is important to know where the \ncasualty needs to go, this may be determined by the severity of injuries, number of casualties, and \navailability of the medical treatment facility. Casualties vary in level of care and are treated at different \nfacilities with varies levels of capability. They are labeled as Roles 1 to 4. Army air and ground evacuation \nplatforms provide connectivity to assure a seamless continuum of medical care (refer to ATP 4-02.2 for \nmore information). (See figure 5-8.)  \nLegend:  AO = area of operations, CONUS = continental United States, POI = point of injury \nFigure 5-8. Army air and ground evacuation \n5-72. The SBCT Infantry rifle company is responsible for planning and coordination for the quickest \nresponse to a casualty with minimal impact on the mission as possible. This may include coordination with \nadjacent units and their support. The platoon or element with the casualty is responsible to provide security, \nrespond to the casualty (combat medic preferred), and notify the company of the situation. The combat \nmedic’s assessment of the casualty determines the time requirement and levels of treatment the commander \nneeds to support his decision for possible options. The commander must nest his CASEVAC plan and \nprocedures with his higher echelons as well as know the locations of adjacent units medical faculties in \norder to meet a timely response for the casualty. The table 5-2 will tell what evacuation procedures are \nrequired for casualties. (Refer to ATP 4-25.13 for more information.) \nChapter 5 \n5-20 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016Table 5-2. Categories of evacuation precedence \nPriority I─URGENT  Is assigned to emergency cases that should be evacuated as soon as \npossible and within a maximum of 1 hour in order to save life, limb, or \neyesight, to prevent complications of serious illness, or to avoid permanent \ndisability.  \nPriority  IA─URGENT -SURG  Is assigned to emergency cases that should be evacuated as soon as \npossible and within a maximum of 1 hour in order to save life, limb, or \neyesight, to prevent complications of serious illness, or to avoid permanent \ndisability.  \nPRIORITY  II─PRIORITY  Is assigned to sick and wounded personnel requiring prompt medical care. \nThis precedence is used when the individual should be evacuated within 4 \nhours or his medical condition could deteriorate to such a degree that he \nwill become an URGENT prece dence, or whose requirements for special \ntreatment are not available locally, or who will suffer unnecessary pain or \ndisability.  \nPRIORITY  III─ROUTINE  Is assigned to sick and wounded personnel requiring evacuation but \nwhose condition is not expected to det eriorate significantly. The sick \nand wounded in this category should be evacuated within 24 hours.  \nPRIORITY  IV─CONVENIENCE  Is assigned to patients for whom evacuation by medical platform is a \nmatter of medical convenience rather than necessity.  \nThe NATO STANAG 3204 has deleted the category of Priority IV —CONVENIENCE; however, it will \nstill be included in the U.S. Army evacuation priorities as there is a requirement for it on the battlefield.  \nTECHNIQUES  \n5-73. techniques for the SBCT Infantry rifle company to handle casualties are — \nConsolidate casualties at a casualty collection point for the company and move them to a\nRole 1 or higher facility under company headquarters control.\nHave the element with the casualty establish a secure LZ and call for MEDEVAC.\nThe company sends the MEV with security escort and picks up casualties at point of injury and\ntransports them to Role 1 or higher facility.\n The company MEV with security escort conducts a linkup with the element with the casualty.\nThe company authorizes diraluth to the element with the casualty and they transport the\ncasualty to the nearest Role 1 or higher medical facility.\n5-74. Within the SBCT Infantry rifle company, the following vehicles can be used to support CASEVAC. \nVehicle  Max Liter Max Ambulatory  Mix Liter/ Ambulatory  \nMEV  4 6 2/3 \nICV 2* 8 1*/4 \nLight medium tactical \nvehicle (LMTV)  7* 12 Multiple combinations  \nMedium tactical \nvehicle ( MTV ) 8* 14 Multiple combinations  \n*Indicates a modification to the vehicle can be made for a nonstandard CASEVAC l itter.\nSECTION VI – ENEMY PRISONER OF WAR AND RETAINED/DETAINED \nPERSONS \n5-75. International law, military training, ROE, and ethical principles demand that EPWs, detainees, and \ncivilians be accorded the utmost humane treatment — \nSustainment \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 5-21 Ensure procedures of 5-S’s and T ( search, silence, segregate, safety, speed, and tag) are\nfollowed.\nUse blindfolds for detainees (according to ROE) as necessary to prevent intelligence collection.\nHave available sand/dust goggles, duct tape, neck gaiters, and pressure dressings. Standardiz e\nEPW kits.\nGather detainee packets with vehicles or at a collection point.\nEvacuate all detainees to the same location.\nKeep personal effects with the detainee. Use Ziploc baggies for this purpose.\nTake photos of each detainee and items of intelligence or evidentiary value in possession of the\ndetainee.\nConduct biometrics identity data collection.\nUse zip ties or flex cuffs to secure detainees.\nDedicate vehicles for detainee transportation. This requirement should be separate from\nCASEVAC and HNSF transportation requirements.\nPlan for blankets or clothing to safeguard detainees when operations are conducted at night\nduring inclement weather.\nRecover shoes for the detainee to wear.\nRemember documentation is important. Enemy forces may be released because of improper\ndocumentation.\nUse explosive detection kits when available. They should be used immediately to provide\nadditional evidence for future legal processing.\nProvide needle proof gloves if possible to avoid injury to those searching and handling\ndetainees.\nCAPTURED ENEMY EQUIPMENT AND CAPTURED ENEMY AMMUNITION  \n5-76. Consolidate captured enemy equipment (CEE) and captured enemy ammunition (CEA) at the end of \nthe operation. This action should have senior leadership oversight preferably the company 1SG and XO. \nNormally the 1SG is responsible and oversees the consolidation and the XO is responsible for the \ncoordination for transportation and disposal with supporting elements. Units need to develop a plan to \nconsolidate, handle, and move CEE and CEA. Be prepared to secure areas where CEE and CEA are found. \nBlow it up in place, if needed. All units should have this capability due to lack of availability of \nEOD/engineers. Follow restrictions in ROE or unit directives. Possess the means to carry contraband \n(garbage bags, sandbags, and so forth) and backhaul it to a captured enemy equipment or ammunition site. \nHandle UXO/IED/booby traps according to unit SOP. Possess the means to catalog and record CEE and \nCEA information, to include photographic media. \nTRANSPORTATION  \n5-77. The XO and commander are responsible to plan sufficient transportation to move the unit in a \nmanner that supports the ground tactical plan. A technique is to plan ground movement in a manner similar \nto an air assault operation with five phases. They are as follows: \nStaging plan.\nLoading plan.\nMovement plan.\nUnloading, control, security, and consolidation of vehicles plan (during execution).\nWithdrawal plan.\n5-78. Be aware that vehicles may not be organic to a unit, so place someone from that unit to mission \ncommand and maintain accountability/liaison with the vehicles. Make every effort to integrate attached \nunits, assets, and personnel. Usually, the XO coordinates with the attached units and the 1SG manages their \nand oversees their support efforts. This includes briefings, rehearsals, and inspections of personnel, \nequipment, and vehicles. Ensure understanding of SOPs and contact drills and conduct detailed rehearsals. \nHNSF need to be part of the transportation plan. Movement may be by their own assets or provided to \nthem. If they are part of the operation then they are included and accounted for in our transportation plan. \nChapter 5 \n5-22 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 20165-79. A master manifest should be maintained at unit level that includes sensitive item inventories and \nother important information. This list can be used to establish accountability if vehicles or sensitive items \nare lost. Conduct preventive maintenance (PM) or preventive maintenance checks and services (PMCS) on \nvehicles before departure. Cross-level or load vehicles with key leaders, skills, logistics, medical assets, and \nweapons systems to avoid the loss of critical assets with the loss of one vehicle. Make sure vehicles are \nmarked or possess markers that can be used to identify their locations to deconflict air and other friendly \nfires. To facilitate mission command, vehicles can be marked on the sides or back based on their departure \ntimes or elements during movement. Nontraditional assets such as civilian trucks may be appropriated \naccording to established ROE to assist in moving personnel or material to or from the objective. \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 6-1 Chapter 6 \nAugmenting Combat Power \nFor the SBCT Infantry rifle company to achieve its full combat potential, the \ncommander integrates all available assets effectively. This chapter discusses fires, \nprotection, aviation, inform and influence activities (IIA), military information \nsupport operations, and civil affairs.  \nSECTION I – FIRES \n6-1. Fire support is fires that directly support land, maritime, amphibious, and special operations forces to \nengage enemy forces, combat formations, and facilities in pursuit of tactical and operational objectives \n(JP 3-09). Fire support assets include mortars, field artillery (FA) cannons, rockets, missiles, CAS, and \nnaval gunfire (NGF). Nonlethal effects may be achieved using obscuration or illumination munitions, and \nsome electronic warfare assets. Nonlethal effects may be achieved by using munitions in a manner \ndesigned to influence rather than injure an opponent. An example of this use might be firing massed \nartillery at an uninhabited area in the opponent’s view to influence his actions.  \nFIRE SUPPORT TEAM \n6-2. Chapter 1, Sections III and IV discussed briefly the organization, duties, and responsibilities of the \nSBCT Infantry rifle company FIST personnel. This section examines in more detail the equipment, \ncapabilities, procedures, and other considerations that affect the SBCT Infantry rifle company FIST and its \nemployment in the accomplishment of lethal and nonlethal fire support tasks. \nA fire support team  is a field artillery team organic to each maneuver battalion and selected\nunits to plan and coordinate all available company supporting fires, including mortars, field\nartillery, naval surface fire support and close air support integration (FM 3-09). The company\ncommander is ultimately responsible for integrating fires in support of his scheme of maneuver;\nthe company FSO serves as his principle advisor for fire support. The company FSO fully needs\nto understand the company commander’s scheme of maneuver. On the basis of the\ncommander’s guidance, the company FSO synchronizes fire support within the maneuver plan\nand presents the fire support plan to the commander for his approval.\nA forward observer is an observer operating with front line troops trained to adjust ground or\nnaval gunfire and pass back battlefield information (JP 3-09). In the absence of a qualified air\ncontroller, the observer may control close air support strikes. Platoon forward observers are\nequipped with target acquisition devices that assist in accurately locating targets and the\ncommunications gear needed to call for fire. They are the primary fire support observers in the\ncompany/troop and are frequently collocated with platoon leaders. They provide target\nrefinement, execute planned fires, and request fires for their supported platoons.\nA Joint Fires Observer  (JFO) is a trained and certified Service member who can request, adjust,\nand control surface-to -surface fires. For air- to-surface fires, they can provide timely and\naccurate targeting information to the Joint Tactical Air Controller (JTAC) or, when approved by\nthe JTAC, to the aircraft directly, and perform autonomous terminal guidance operations (TGO).\nThe JFO adds joint warfighting capability but cannot provide terminal attack control during\nCAS operations (ATP 3-09.32/MCRP 3-16.6A/NTTP 3-09.2/AFTTP(I) 3-2.6 ).\nCOMMUNICATIONS  \n6-3. The FIST has the capability to transmit on or monitor these five networks: \nFires battalion fire direction net (digital). The FIST uses this net to send calls for fire.\nChapter 6 \n6-2 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016SBCT Infantry rifle company command network (voice). This network enables the FIST to\nmonitor company operations, and links it to the commander and platoon leaders for planning\nand coordination.\nBlue Force Tracker (BFT)/Joint Capabilities Release (JCR) enables the FIST to have a COP\nwith the SBCT Infantry rifle company, the SBCT Infantry battalion fires cell, and other fire\nsupport teams.\nSBCT Infantry battalion fire support network (voice). The FIST communicates with the fires on\nthis network for which the fires cell is the NCS.\nMortar platoon fire direction network (digital). As needed, the FIST sends fire missions to the\nsupporting mortar platoon or section using this network.\nFIRE SUPPORT TEAM EMPLOYMENT  \n6-4. The SBCT Infantry rifle company fire support officer (FSO), usually collocated with the company \ncommander, positions the fire support vehicle where he or the senior fire support sergeant can observe and \ncontrol execution of the fires plan or a specified fire support task most effectively. The FSO establishes OP \nthat takes maximum advantage of the capability of the Lightweight Laser Designator/Rangefinder (LLDR) \nsystem and Laser Designator Module (LDM) to execute lethal, accurate fires. The FSO communicates with \nthe commander on the company command net. This option allows the FSO to maintain effective control of \nhis FOs and to conduct required fires coordination.  \nFIRE SUPPORT PLANNING AND COORDINATION \n6-5. Effective fire support does not happen without prior planning and coordination. The observer knows \nwhat his responsibilities are and where he fits into the overall plan. \n6-6. The FSO is in charge of the company FIST. He is also the principal fire support advisor to the \ncompany commander when assigned or attached to a company or troop. The FIST plans, coordinates, and \nexecutes fire support for the company commander’s concept of operations. The FSO ensures he thoroughly \nunderstands what the company commander is trying to do and how the commander wants fires to influence \nthe operation. \n6-7. The maneuver commander has the responsibility to integrate fire support with the scheme of \nmaneuver. He provides the commander’s intent for an operation and issues guidance, including guidance \nfor fire support. The FSO translates the guidance into tasks for fire support. The FSO then assigns tasks to \nthe observers that enable the FIST to complete the tasks assigned by the commander. \n6-8. The maneuver commander also has the responsibility to ensure that observers understand what \ntargets can be engaged, when they can be engaged, and which targets are the priority for the operation. \n6-9. Observers have a responsibility to ensure they understand the criteria for engaging targets established \nby the commander. (Refer to ATP 3-09.32/MCRP 3-16.6A/NTTP 3-09.2/AFTTP(I) 3-2.6) for more \ninformation on fire support planning and coordination .) \n6-10. Fire support planning includes developing integrated fire plans (target lists, fire support execution \nmatrix (FSEM), FIST matrix, scheme of fires, and overlays) and determining forward observer control \noptions that support the commander’s scheme of maneuver.  \n6-11. The FIST stays abreast of the maneuver situation at all times and monitor voice requests for fire \nsupport within the maneuver element to prevent fratricide as the result of friendly fire support. The FIST \nadvises the commander on any fire support coordination measures (FSCMs) in effect. \nNote.  Risks are always present when employing fires. Everyone involved with the planning, \ncoordinating, and delivery of fires is responsible for evaluating and managing the risks. (Refer to \nATP 5-19 for more information.) \nAugmenting Combat Power \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 6-3 Basic Fire Support Tasks \n6-12. Effectiveness of the fire support effort is measured by creating desired effects on the enemy, setting \nconditions for decisive operations, and supporting joint force operations. Effective fire support depends on \nplanning for the successful performance of the following four basic fire support tasks: \nSupport Forces in Contact. The commander provides responsive fire support that protects and\nensures freedom of maneuver to forces in contact with the enemy throughout the operational\narea.\nSupport the Concept of Operation. The concept of operations (CONOPS) clearly and concisely\nexpresses what the commander intends to accomplish and how it will be done using available\nresources. The concept of fires describes how fires will be synchronized and integrated to\nsupport the commander’s objectives as articulated in the CONOPS.\nSynchronize Joint Fire Support. Fire support is synchronized through fire support coordination,\nbeginning with the commander’s visualization and CONOPS. Fire support is planned both\ncontinuously and concurrently with the development of the scheme of maneuver. Further,\noperations providing fire support is synchronized with other force operations (for example, air\noperations, information collection functions, SO, and IO) in order to optimize the application of\nlimited resources, achieve synergy, and avoid fratricide.\nSustain Joint Fire Support Operations. Fire support planners formulate fire support plans to\nreflect logistic limitations and to exploit logistic capabilities. Ammunition, fuel, food, water,\nmaintenance, transportation, and medical support are all critical to sustaining fire support\noperations.\nTypes of Fir es \n6-13. In fire planning, consider the following types of fires — \nFires not only in front of the force, but also to the flanks and rear. The commander and FSO\nusually plans one third of the maximum range of organic fire support to stay behind the forward\nline of troops.\nMassed fires on choke points and key terrain to canalize, slow, and block the enemy movement.\nFires to suppress bypassed enemy pockets of resistance until friendly maneuver elements are\nsafely past. Suppressive fires and other fires may then be needed to support follow-on force\nactions against the bypassed forces.\nFires that do not create obstacles and barriers to friendly forces and limit forward progress.\nDesired Effects \n6-14. Desired effects describe the lethal and nonlethal effects fires (including EW systems) that need to be \nachieved against a specific target. The company commander can use numerous terms to describe desired \neffects, with the most common being deceive, degrade, delay, deny, destroy, disrupt, divert, exploit, \ninterdict, influence, neutralize, and suppress. (Refer to ADRP 3-09 for more information.) \nEffects \n6-15. An effect is — \nThe physical or behavioral state of a system that results from an action, a set of actions, or\nanother effect.\nThe result, outcome, or consequence of an action.\nA change to a condition, behavior, or degree of freedom as the result, outcome, or consequence\nof an action.\n6-16. Army and joint doctrine describe effects in two ways: \nDirect effect. A direct effect is the proximate, first-order consequence of an action, such as the\ndestruction of a target by precision-guided munitions. Direct effects are immediate and easily\nrecognizable.\nIndirect effect. An indirect effect is a delayed or displaced consequence associated with the\naction that caused the direct effect. Indirect effects often are less observable or recognizable\nChapter 6 \n6-4 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  than direct effects, particularly when they involve changes in an adversary’s behavior. However, \nan indirect effect may be the one desired. \nAllocation \n6-17. Decisions on allocations of fires are based on the decisive operation, the task of each unit, and the \nexpected enemy capabilities. The commander ensures all fires assets are addressed to include target \nacquisition (TA). Allocation may be expressed as specific targets, numbers of targets/zones for planning \npurposes, or as assets available (for example, 1x FA PLT DS to Alpha Co). Priority of fires is addressed for \nplanned activities but can change based on a change to the enemy COA, completion of events, or planned \nbranches and sequels. \nPositioning Guidance \n6-18. Positioning guidance provides instructions for the movement of fires assets and observer positioning \nto support the scheme of maneuver. Positioning guidance should highlight any specific changes to the unit \nbasic load, if necessary for special missions. The positioning guidance should address the commander’s \nsummary report (CSR) particularly if it impacts successful mission accomplishment. An example of \npositioning guidance is as follows: “MTR PLT IPRTF vic NLT H+20 and support 1st PLT breach vic OBJ \nCHIEFS. Ensure 40 min x 400 of smoke on hand. 2d PLT establish OP1 vic 7081 with laser designating \ncapability. CSR limited to 10 HE/ 5 SMK/ 3 ILLUM.”  \nAttack Guidance \n6-19. Attack guidance describes which delivery systems are to be used to attack specific target types and \nthe criteria that needs to be met before processing the target. Initial attack guidance is usually provided \nfrom a higher headquarters order and should be modified as needed based on mission analysis and COA \ndevelopment. Attack guidance is usually articulated in a matrix format. It also may be included in the \nfollowing products: \nHigh-payoff target list (HPTL).\nTarget selection standards (TSS).\nAttack guidance matrix (AGM).\nRestrictions \n6-20. Restrictions describe constraints in terms of requiring something to do or prohibiting an action. Some \nconsiderations include restrictions on ammunition expenditures, types of fires, areas of employment, \ncreation of obstacles, limiting risk to friendly troops, minimizing the loss of civilian life, and permissive \nand restrictive FSCMs. Examples of restrictions are: “No cratering munitions on HWY 322. No occupation \nor use of incendiary munitions in built up areas. CFL PL BLUE, o/o PL RED. NFA 1- 2 in effect.”  \nCLEARANCE OF FIRES \n6-21. The maneuver commander is the final authority to approve (clear) fires and their effects within his \nzone or AO. Although the commander may delegate authority to coordinate and clear fires to his FSO, the \nultimate responsibility belongs to the commander. During certain operations, especially in stability tasks, it \nmay take a BCT commander or a division commander to approve fires. Usually, the FSO assists the \ncommander by recommending the clearance of fires and provides an assessment of collateral damage if \nnecessary. Using BFT/JCR allows request fires digitally by highlighting the call-for -fire box on the \nBFT/JCR supporting arms liaison team (SALT) report tab or using a traditional call-for -fire format. Once \nthe FSO receives this request via BFT/JCR, he clears the request through the company commander. If the \ncompany commander approves the request, the FSO then forwards the request through the fire support \nchannels via FM or the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). \nOBSCURATION AND SCREENING  \n6-22. Leaders have a variety of smoke munitions available to achieve the desired effects. Since weather \nconditions can affect obscuration, the company commander ensures that they set the conditions for the \nproper employment and placement of smoke to enable the mission with respect to adjacent units that may \nbe affected. \nAugmenting Combat Power \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 6-5 6-23. When used correctly smoke can significantly reduce the enemy’s effectiveness both in daytime and \nat night. Use smoke to reduce the ability of the enemy to deliver effective fires, to hamper hostile \noperations, and to deny the enemy information on friendly positions and maneuvers. Smoke reduces the \neffectiveness of laser beams and inhibits electro-optical systems including some night vision devices. The \nfour types of smoke are — \nObscuring smoke  is placed on or near the enemy to suppress enemy observers and to minimize\ntheir vision.\nScreening smoke  is a smoke curtain used on the battlefield between enemy observation points\nand friendly units to mask friendly forces, positions, and activities.\nDeception smoke is a smoke curtain used to deceive and confuse the enemy as to the nature of\nfriendly operations.\nSignaling smoke  is used to establish a reference for friendly forces.\n6-24. Use obscuring smoke to — \nDefeat flash ranging and restrict the enemy’s counterfire program.\nObscure enemy observation posts and reduce their ability to provide accurate target location for\nenemy fire support assets.\nObscure enemy direct fire weapons and lasers.\nInstill apprehension and increase enemy patrolling.\nSlow enemy vehicles to blackout speeds.\nIncrease control problems by preventing effective visual signals and increasing radio traffic.\nDefeat night observation devices and reduce the capability of most IR devices.\n6-25. Use screening smoke for — \nDeceptive Screens.  Smoke draws fire. Deceptive screens cause the enemy to disperse his fires\nand expend his ammunition.\nFlank Screens.  Smoke may be used to screen exposed flanks.\nAreas Forward of the Objective. Smoke helps the maneuver units consolidate on the objective\nunhindered by enemy ground observers.\nRiver Crossing Operations. Screening the primary crossing site denies the enemy information.\nDeceptive screens deceive the enemy as to the exact location of the main crossing.\nObstacle Breaching.  The enemy is denied the ability to observe breaching unit activities.\nILLUMINATION \n6-26. Illumination fires (visible or infrared) are useful in exposing an opponent at night. Illumination fires \nmay give friendly forces an advantage by reducing the enemy forces’ ability to operate at night without \nbeing targeted and attacked with minimal collateral damage. Infrared illu mination enhances the Soldier’s \nuse of some night vision devices to more easily locate targets and enable surprise fires on enemy forces not \nequipped with night vision devices. \nFIELD ARTILLERY \n6-27. FA is the maneuver commander’s principal means for providing in direct FS to his maneuver forces. \nFA can neutralize, suppress, or destroy enemy direct fire forces, attack enemy artillery and mortars, provide \nbattlefield obscuration, and deliver FASCAM to isolate and interdict enemy forces, or to protect friendly \noperations. FA elements within maneuver organizations serve as the integrating center for all elements of \nFS. FA delivery systems include cannons, rockets, and missiles. These systems can provide fires under all \nconditions of weather and in all types of terrain. They can shift and mass fires rapidly without having to \ndisplace. \nMORTARS \n6-28. The mortar platoon organic to the SBCT Infantry battalions can augment the company mortars to \nprovide more responsive indirect fires. Battalion mortars provide close, immediately responsive fire \nsupport for committed companies. These fires harass, suppress, neutralize, and destroy enemy attack \nChapter 6 \n6-6 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016formations and defenses; obscure the enemy’s vision; and inhibit the enemy’s ability to maneuver. Mortars \ncan be used for final protective fires, smoke, and illumination. \n6-29. The SBCT Infantry battalion commander decides how and when to integrate mortars, as a key fire \nsupport asset, into his operations plan. However, since they are fire support assets, the battalion FSO should \ngive advice and make recommendations to the commander. The battalion commander may specify mortar \nsupport for subordinate units by changing the command relationship, assigning priority of fires, or \nassigning priority targets. The company commander and FSO should integrate their mortar section to cover \ntargets to support in the company scheme maneuver and engage plan targets that may not be covered by the \nbattalion mortar platoon. \nSECTION III – PROTECTION \n6-30.  Protection tasks and systems reduce risk, mitigate identified vulnerabilities, and act on opportunity. \nThe tasks and systems that comprise the protection warfighting function effectively protect the force, \nenhance the preservation of combat power, and increase the probability of mission success. The SBCT \nInfantry rifle company commander integrates and synchronizes organic and augmented forces that support \ntheir own and higher echelons protection tasks with their operations. (Refer to ADRP 3-37 for more \ninformation.) \n6-31. The 14 protection tasks and systems are — \nAir and missile defense.\nPersonnel recovery.\nOperational area security.\nAntiterrorism.\nSurvivability.\nForce health protection.\nCBRN.\nEmploy safety techniques (including fratricide).\nOperations security.\nProvide explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) and protection support.\nIntelligence support to protection.\nPhysical security procedures.\nLaw and order.\nInternment and resettlement.\n6-32. The following paragraphs discuss the seven protection tasks and systems that the SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany encounter that have not been previous explained. \nAIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE \n6-33. Air defense artillery is to provide fires to protect the force and selected geopolitical assets from aerial \nattack, missile attack, and surveillance. The SBCT Infantry rifle company operates with air defense systems \nand synchronize operations to ensure that the air defense systems are protected from a ground threat to \nensure the higher unit’s commander’s protection plan is implemented accordingly. AMD elements protect \ninstallations and personnel from over-the-horizon strike by conventional and CBRNE warheads according \nto METT-TC. \n6-34. Indirect fire protection systems protect forces from threats that are largely immune to air defense \nartillery systems. The indirect fire protection intercept capability is designed to detect and destroy incoming \nrocket, artillery, and mortar fires. This capability assesses the threat to maintain friendly protection and \ndestroys the incoming projectile at a safe distance from the intended target. \n6-35. The AMD task consists of active and passive measures that protect personnel and physical assets \nfrom an air or missile attack. Passive measures include camouflage, cover, concealment, hardening, and \nAugmenting Combat Power \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 6-7 OPSEC. Active measures are taken to destroy, neutralize, or reduce the effectiveness of hostile air and \nmissile threats. (Refer to ADRP 3-37 for more information .) \nTHE THREAT  \n6-36. In analyzing the physical variable of a battalion’s operational environment, planners must take into \naccount the airspace above the battalion’s AO. S ome areas to consider include:  \nLocation of threat airfields and launching points.\nRange of aircraft and missiles.\nPhysical constraints in the friendly AO.\nBuildings and other structures.\nPower lines and antennas.\nHills, trees, and other natural barriers to movement and observation.\nWeather.\n6-37. The following are some of the types of air threats and typical maneuvers that the battalion can expect \nto encounter against a well-equipped enemy:  \nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAV’s) are small and elusive. They usu ally fly low, but the altitude\ncan vary. Once in the target area, they may fly an orbit attempting to stay out of engagement\nrange of ADA.\nMost surface-launched cruise missiles follow the terrain and use terrain masking. Due to their\nrange, they might take indirect approach routes.\nBallistic missiles are not terrain-dependent. They fly from launch point to objective. Their flight\nis not restricted by terrain.\nTactical air-to -surface missiles usually fly direct routes from launch platform to the target.\nRotary-wing aircraft primarily conduct contour flights. They follow ridgelines and military\ncrests, using the terrain to mask their approach to the target area.\nFixed-wing aircraft usually follow major terrain or man-made features. Depending on range,\nthey may fly a straight line to the target.\nOrdnance or payload can affect range and altitude of the air system and, thus, influence the\nselection of avenues of approach for airborne and air assault operations.\n6-38. Units can expect the threat to attempt to counter U.S. defensive and offensive operations with a \nmyriad of aerial platforms. UAS provide the threat commander the necessary information to determine \nfriendly unit locations, movements, and objectives. Aerial and artillery strikes can be generated from th e \nintelligence gathered against the following targets:   \nManeuver force.\nForward arming and refueling points.\nAviation bases.\nCommand and control nodes.\nReserve troop concentrations.\nForward support company areas.\nTerrain features.\nObstacles constricting unit movements as U.S. forces advance to close with the enemy forces.\n6-39. Lethal UAS can be effective in disabling mission command, and intelligence facilities or destroying \narmored vehicles. The threat probably will use cruise missiles against logistical concentration, mission \ncommand nodes, or with submunitions for area denial. It probably will use rotary wing aircraft to attack \nforward elements and the flanks of the advancing enemy maneuver force to slow their tempo, cause \nconfusion and, thereby, inflict maximum casualties. Rotary wing aircraft also can be used to conduct \noperations across forward line of own troops (FLOT), CAS, and air insertion operations. Armed attack \nhelicopters constitute the most widespread and capable air threats to friendly ground forces in the close \nbattle.  \nChapter 6 \n6-8 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016PASSIVE AIR DEFENSE  \n6-40. Soldiers use passive air defense measures to avoid detection from enemy air attack. Passive air \ndefense is all measures, other than active air defense, taken to minimize the effectiveness of hostile air and \nmissile threats against friendly forces and assets. These measures include camouflage, concealment, \ndeception, dispersion, reconstitution, redundancy, detection and warning systems, and the use of protective \nconstruction. (JP 3-01) Concealing large vehicles like the Abrams tank and Bradley fighting vehicle (BFV) \nis difficult. Commanders should consider deception techniques to disguise their intentions and active air \ndefense.  \nDAMAGE -LIMITING MEASURES  \n6-41. Damage-limiting measures are attempts to limit any damages should the enemy detect friendly \nforces. These measures are used when units are in a static position such as an assembly area, or when they \nare maneuvering. If caught in the open, personnel should immediately execute battle drills and move to \npositions of cover and concealment that reduce the enemy's ability to acquire or engage them. The same \nmeasures taken to limit damage from artillery attack are used for dispersion, protective construction, and \ncover. Examples of damage-limiting measures include vehicle dispersion, camouflage, and dug-in fighting \npositions with overhead protection.  \nACTIVE AIR DEFENSE  \n6-42. Although passive measures are the first line of defense against air attack, troops must be prepared to \nengage attacking enemy aircraft. The decision to fight an air threat is based on the immediate situation and \nweapons system capabilities. Based on the mission, companies do not typically engage aircraft except for \nself-preservation or as directed by the battalion or company commander.  \nENGAGEMENT TECHNIQUES  \n6-43. The crew’s goal is to engage and destroy or suppress targets as fast as possible. Basic engagement \nprocedures used for all engagements include:  \nThe vehicle commander might be required to lay the gun for direction if the gunner’s scan is\naway from the target. He will release control to the gunner (target hand-off) and issue the fire\ncommand.\nOnce the target is acquired, the gunner identifies and discriminates the target.\nThe vehicle commander then confirms the target and gives the fire command.\nThe gunner completes his switch checks.\nSMALLS ARMS USED FOR AIR DEFENSE  \n6-44. Small arms used for air defense incorporate the use of volume fire and proper aiming points \naccording to the target. The key to success in engaging enemy air is to put out a high volume of fire. All \nweapons designated by the commander should be used, including Stryker Vehicles, HUMWVs and trucks, \nand Infantry direct fire automatic weapons. The commander must decide whether to engage and must \nprovide the engagement command for the entire unit to fire upon the attacking aircraft rather than having \nSoldiers fire at the aircraft individually.  \nSURVIVABILITY \n6-45. Survivability  includes all aspects of protecting personnel, weapons, and supplies while \nsimultaneously deceiving the enemy. Survivability tactics include building a good defense; employing \nfrequent movement; using concealment, deception, and camouflage; and constructing fighting and \nprotective positions for both individuals and equipment. \n6-46. Survivability operations  are the development and construction of protective positions (such as earth \nberms, dug-in positions, overhead protection, and counter surveillance means) to reduce the effectiveness \nof enemy weapons systems. Survivability operations range from employing camouflage, concealment, and \ndeception to include the supporting task of battlefield obscuration to hardening facilities, mission command \nnodes, and critical infrastructure. \nAugmenting Combat Power \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 6-9 6-47. Survivability operations often enable other protection tasks and systems, to include AMD, \noperational area security, antiarmor, and CBRN. Survivability operations also provide support to the \nmovement and maneuver warfighting function by conducting mobility and countermobility operations. \n6-48. Commanders may call on engineers to support the protection efforts. Augmented engineers to the \nSBCT can mass their skills and equipment to develop defensive positions into fortifications or \nstrongpoint’s and improve defensive positions. They provide survivability applications to host nation \nfacilities and U.S.-operated facilities to include entry control points, guard towers, and other means of \nhardening.  \n6-49. While survivability operations are traditionally recognized as an engineer task, units at all echelons \nhave an inherent responsibility to improve their positions, whether a fighting position, bunker, or forward \noperating bases ( FOB ). Survivability consists of four areas that are designed to reemphasize efforts toward \nmitigating friendly losses to hostile actions or environments. They are as follows: \nMobility. Maintaining freedom of movement is usually the SBCT engineer company’s primary\neffort when conducting offense, defense, and operations to support stability tasks.\nSituational understanding. Situational understanding  is the product of applying analysis and\njudgment to relevant information to determine the relationship between the mission variables to\nfacilitate decision making (ADRP 3-0). It requires the ability to identify, process, and\ncomprehend the critical elements of information about what occurs inside the commander’s AO.\nHaving accurate situational understanding provides the baseline for hazard assessments\nNote. The situational understanding of terrain, through proper terrain analysis, is important to \nsurvivability and the development of survivability positions, minimizing the requirements to \nadjust terrain and leading to the efficient use of survivability assets. \nHardening. Hardening is the act of using natural or man-made materials to protect personnel,\nequipment, or facilities. Hardening measures protect resources from blast, direct and indirect\nfire, heat, radiation, or EW. Hardening is accomplished by using barriers, walls, shields, berms,\nor other types of physical protection. It is intended to defeat or negate the effects of an attack\nand includes fighting positions, protective positions, armored vehicles, Soldiers, and\ninformation systems. The Stryker vehicles can engage targets without exposing their hull if\nbehind a hardened position.\nCamouflage, concealment, and deception. Camouflage, concealment, and deception use\nmaterials and techniques to hide, blend, disguise, decoy, or disrupt the appearance of military\ntargets and their backgrounds to prevent visual and electronic detection of friendly forces.\nCamouflage, concealment, and deception help prevent an enemy from detecting or identifying\nfriendly troops, equipment, activities, or installations and include battlefield obscuration\ncapabilities to obscure, screen, mark, or deceive. Battlefield obscuration is a major supporting\ntask of camouflage, concealment, and deception and is typically provided by specialized CBRN\nelements or fires.\nFORCE HEALTH PROTECTION \n6-50. Force health protection includes measures taken by commanders, leaders, individual Soldiers, and \nthe military health system to promote, improve, or conserve the behavioral and physical well-being of \nSoldiers. These measures enable a healthy and fit force, prevent injury and illness, and protect the force \nfrom health hazards. It includes the prevention aspects of several Army Medical Department functions, \nsuch as — \nPreventive medicine to include medical surveillance and occupational and environmental health\nsurveillance.\nVeterinary services, including food safety, food security, quality assurance, animal care\nmissions, and the prevention of animal borne diseases transmissible to man.\nCombat and operational stress control.\nLaboratory services to include area medical laboratory (AML) support.\nDental services to include preventive dentistry.\nChapter 6 \n6-10 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 20166-51. Army personnel need to be physically and behaviorally fit. This requirement demands programs that \npromote and improve the capacity of personnel to perform military tasks at high levels, under extreme \nconditions, and for extended period. These preventive and protective capabilities include physical exercise, \nnutritional diets, dental hygiene and restorative treatment, combat and operational stress management, rest, \nrecreation, and relaxation that are geared to individual or organizations. (Refer to ADRP 3-37 for more \ninformation.) \nCHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR \n6-52. CBRN are the employment of tactical capabilities that counter the entire range of CBRN threats and \nhazards through CBRNE proliferation prevention, CBRNE counterforce, CBRN defense, and CBRN \nconsequence management activities. In turn these support operational and strategic objectives to combat \nCBRNE and operate safely in CBRN environments. CBRN threats and hazards include CBRNE, \nimprovised weapons and devices, and toxic industrial materials (TIM) and can potentially cause mass \ncasualties and large-scale destruction. Many state and nonstate actors (to include terrorists and criminals) \npossess or have the capability to possess, develop, and proliferate CBRNE. U.S. policy prohibits the use of \nchemical or biological weapons under any circumstances, but it reserves the right to employ nuclear \nweapons. Many potential enemies are under no such constraint.  \n6-53. Protecting Soldiers from the harmful hazards associated with CBRN attacks in an AO is essential to \npreserving combat power. When the probability of CBRN threat exists, commanders and leaders conduct a \ndeliberate analysis to posture and equip forces for survival and mission effectiveness. CBRN personnel \nconsider METT-TC and related information to provide recommendations on protection requirements that \nare reflected in the mission-oriented protective posture (MOPP) level. Staff and leader involvement ensures \nsafe and sustained operations under various climatic conditions. Commanders should develop standard \nresponses and COAs for each projected mission. The standard MOPP levels are — \nMOPP Ready. Carry a protective mask, and ensure that individual protective gear is available\nwithin 2 hours. A second set needs to be available in 6 hours.\nMOPP0. Carry a protective mask, and ensure that individual protective gear is available, within\narm’s reach.\nMOPP1. Don an overgarment.\nMOPP2. Don protective boots.\nMOPP3. Don a protective mask.\nMOPP4. Don protective gloves.\n6-54. Leaders know that they cannot expect the same work rates in MOPP4 as they achieved in MOPP0. \nThey reevaluate the ability to meet mission requirements and communicate changes to the force. MOPP \nreduction decisions are between the most difficult to make because of the many considerations that affect \nthe final decision. The CBRN reconnaissance platoon in the brigade engineer battalion (BEB) assists in the \ndecision-making process by confirming or denying the presence of a CBRN threat through reconnaissance. \nCommanders evaluate the situation from the intelligence of the threats capabilities and intentions and the \nrisks associated with operations. Factors include the criticality of the established mission, potential effects \nof personnel exposure, and the impact on the casualty care system. Commanders can then determine what \nfollow-on COAs to employ. \n6-55. Leaders determine the appropriate MOPP level by assessing METT-TC factors and weighing the \nimpact of increased protection levels. Higher headquarters provides MOPP level directives to subordinate \nelements. (Refer to FM 3-11.4 for more information.) \nEMPLOY SAFETY TECHNIQUES \n6-56. Safety needs to be considered as part of planning for all missions. Operational conditions often \nimpose significant hazards to Soldiers through the increased probability of an accidental event. In an \nextreme OE, these hazards raise the risk level as equipment and personnel are taxed. Leaders need to know \ntheir Soldiers and trained crews, and operators need to know the capabilities and limitations of their \nplatforms and systems. To maintain a continuous operational tempo, commanders need to know how to \nemploy and sustain personnel and equipment. When planning operations, commanders — \nAugmenting Combat Power \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 6-11 Consider human endurance limits and environmental conditions.\nBalance the possible benefits of sustained, high-tempo operations with the level of risk.\nAccept no unnecessary risks.\nConduct high-risk operations only when the potential gain or benefit outweighs the potential\nloss.\n6-57. Integrating safety into the operations process through the protection warfighting function and the risk \nmanagement process provides an opportunity to identify and assess hazards to the force and develop risk \nreduction measures. The responsibility for safety starts with the commander and continues through the \nchain of command to individuals. Safety works best when all leaders and Soldiers receive training to \nrecognize hazards and implement controls to reduce or mitigate risks in their daily operations. (Refer to \nATP 5-19 for more information .) \n6-58. Fratricide and friendly fire are the unintentional killing of friendly personnel by friendly firepower. \nThe destructive power and range of modern weapons, coupled with the high intensity and rapid tempo of \ncombat, increase the potential for fratricide and friendly fire. Tactical maneuvers, terrain, and weather \nconditions may increase the danger of fratricide and friendly fire. (See chapter 1 of this publication.) \n6-59. SBCT Infantry rifle companies need to pay close attention to surface danger zones (SDZs) when \nconducting operations. With the addition of more crew served weapons, RWS, MGS, and Infantry; weapon \ncapability awareness is much more of a factor. The Stryker vehicle is designed to be a carrier and not a \ncombat vehicle. The technique is to deploy Soldiers from the vehicle before making contact. This can often \nlead to Infantry being forward of the vehicles and their weapon systems and in their SDZs. Leaders should \nplan means of mounted maneuver with dismounted elements to avoid potential fratricide.  \nOPERATIONS SECURITY \n6-60. OPSEC  is the process of identifying essential elements of friendly information and analyzing \nfriendly actions attendant to military operations and other activities to — \nIdentify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems.\nDetermine indicators hostile intelligence systems might obtain that could be interpreted or\npieced together to derive critical information in time to be useful to adversaries.\nSelect and execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities of\nfriendly actions to adversary exploitation.\n6-61. OPSEC applies to all operations across the range of military operations. All units conduct OPSEC to \npreserve essential secrecy. Commanders establish routine OPSEC measures in unit SOPs.  \nEXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE DISPOSAL \n6-62. The mission of EOD is to eliminate or reduce the effects of explosive ordnance (EO) hazards to \nprotect combat power. EO hazards are frequently increasing dangers in the modern combat. They limit \nmobility, deny the use of critical assets, and threaten to injure or kill Soldiers at levels unprecedented in the \npast. U.S. and multinational use of munitions that disperse submunitions across a wide area has led to \nincreased amounts of UXO on the battlefield. EOD forces are trained, equipped, and organized to deal with \nthe increased quantity, sophistication, and lethality of EO and support U.S. and multinational forces across \nthe range of military operations.  \nIMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE DEFEAT (IED  DEFEAT ) \n6-63. The IED defeat framework is derived from the fundamentals of assured mobility. Assured mobility \nencompasses those actions that provide commanders with the ability to deploy, move, and maneuver where \nand when they desire (without interruption or delay) and to achieve the mission. (Refer to FM 3-34 for \nmore information.) The fundamentals of assured mobility assist in developing SA for the commander that \nallows them to exploit opportunities to defeat the IED before its inception.   \n6-64. Because all IEDs will not be eliminated, the commander plans to mitigate the impact by developing \nSOPs, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), battle drills, and other responsive means to lessen the \neffects of the IED or eliminate the enemy’s desired outcome. To effectively mitigate the impact of IEDs, \nChapter 6 \n6-12 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  the fundamentals of detect, avoid, neutralize, and protect are used in conjunction with METT-TC to plan \nand develop coordinated and well-executed responses. \n6-65. The commander conducts clearing operations in support of an overall IED defeat mission. The \nreemphasis of clearing operations is on the IED or explosive hazard itself. However, the device is merely \nthe end product of a complex set of enemy activities. An IED attack is the result of a planned attack with \nseveral key elements that work in a coordinated and synchronized manner to attain a desired result . \nCollection of biometric identity data enables the commander to attack the IED human network and enable \nthe route clearing tasks for the very same reason.  \n6-66. Route clearance is an enabling task in IED defeat. It provides the maneuver commander the \ncapability to employ a combined arms force of combat engineers, EOD, and other units task-organized, \nequipped, and trained to neutralize the IED threat along critical routes. Route provides one of a number of \nsolutions the commander may employ to defeat this type of threat. A cleared route is only clear as long as it \nis under friendly observation. (Refer to ATP 3-90.37 for more information.) \nSECTION IV – AVIATION \n6-67. Army aviation uses maneuver to concentrate and sustain combat power at critical times and places to \nfind, fix, and destroy threat forces. Aviation units design, tailor, and configure their assets in support of the \nSBCT Infantry rifle company for specific operational support based on mission guidance and the specific \narea of responsibility (AOR) in which the units operate. The organization could be a combination of attack \nreconnaissance, assault, lift, and maintenance units. (Refer to FM 3-52 for more information.) \nAIR-GROUND OPERATIONS \n6-68. Today’s operational environment requires combined arms at all levels, ther efore, the likelihood of \nSBCT Infantry rifle company commanders receiving attack and utility aviation for support is ever \nincreasing. The following are some considerations for the company commander when receiving aviation \nassets: \nExchange of frequencies, call signs, and FM check-in times.\nTerrain model and radio rehearsals.\nLocation of air corridors and air control points.\nLocation of aerial attack by fire (ABF)/SBF/BPs.\nIdentification method for marking ground targets.\nAircraft weapons configuration and station times.\nFriendly recognition symbols for both aircraft and ground vehicles.\nFire coordination measures.\nLocation and marking of LZs and PZs for MEDEVAC, CASEVAC, and aerial resupply.\n6-69. Ground maneuver commanders understand that aviation forces can provide a significant advantage \nduring operations. The company commander must understand that the unique capabilities of Army aviation \nrequire unique planning and coordination. Direct fire aviation missions in the close fight differ greatly from \nengagements in a cross-forward line of own troops (FLOT) operation. In a cross-FLOT operation, attack \naircraft can benefit from deliberate planning and freely engaging at maximum ranges with minimal concern \nof fratricide. Engagements in the close fight, on the other hand, often result in engagements within enemy \ndirect fire weapons system ranges that are close to friendly units. The TLPs need to integrate Army aviation \nforces to ensure effective combined arms employment. Effective combined arms employment requires that \naviation and ground maneuver forces synchronize their operations by operating from a common \nperspective. The following paragraphs highlight some possible procedures that aid in creating a common \nair-ground perspective. \nCAS  AND CCA EXECUTION  \n6-70. The ALO and JTAC personnel in the TACP are the primary means for requesting and controlling \nCAS. However, reconnaissance units conducting shaping operations, such as reconnaissance and \nAugmenting Combat Power \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 6-13 surveillance missions that have joint fires observer certified personnel, may observe and request CAS \nthrough the JTAC. \n6-71. Any element in contact uses the CCA 5-Line attack brief to initiate the CCA. The CCA 5-Line attack \nbrief allows the ground maneuver forces to communicate and reconfirm to the aircraft the exact location of \nfriendly and enemy forces. The ground commander owning the terrain clears fires during the CCA by \ngiving aircrews the situational awareness of the location of friendly elements. The ground commander \ndeconflicts the airspace between indirect fires, CAS, and the CCA aircraft. \nGround Maneuver Force and Target Marking \n6-72. The rapid and accurate marking of a target is essential to a positive target handover. Aircraft \nconducting CCAs will develop an attack plan that is METT-TC dependent and meets the ground \ncommander’s task and purpos e. The aircrew generally has an extremely limited amount of time to acquire \nboth the friendly and enemy locations. Attack reconnaissance aircrews use both thermal sight and night \nvision goggles (NVG) to fly with and acquire targets.  \n6-73. Marking methods for identifying targets and friendly positions vary from one ground maneuver force \nto another. Request should include a detailed description of all friendly locations and target locations in \nrelation to friendly positions. It should include the target description and how it is marked.  \n6-74. For mutual protection and clarity on the appropriate target, the ground maneuver force does not mark \nthe target until requested by the aviation element. This in no way restricts the ground maneuver force from \nreturning fire from the enemy. However, the ground maneuver force should consider that the aircrews may \nnot be able to distinguish the correct target from other fires if they mark the target with fire. Visual \nmarkings can be viewed by the enemy force and provide them early warning to an attack from the air. \nGround maneuver forces should have multiple means of marking their positions. If the target is marked by \nfire, the aviation element requests the ground maneuver force to stop marking. The aviation element calls \nwhen clear of the area and reports estimated BDA. \nHandover \n6-75. The ground forces commander ensures that effects from fires both direct and indirect systems are not \nendangering air assets prior to handing over the engagement to air assets. Ground forces normally require \nmeans to suppress or fix the enemy in position within moments before the air asset engages the targets.  \n6-76. Aircraft normally rely on a high rate of speed and low altitude for survivability in the target area. As \nsuch, the aircrew generally has an extremely limited amount of time to acquire both the friendly and enemy \nmarks. The ground maneuver force must have the marking ready and turned on when requested by the \naircrew. If target is not marked the air asset may not engage, miss its target, or commit fratricide. \n6-77. After initially engaging the target, the aircrew generally approaches from a different angle for \nsurvivability reasons if another attack is required. The observer makes adjustments using the eight cardinal \ndirections and distance (meters) with the last round’s impact and the actual target. At the conclusion of the \nCCA, the aircrew provides its best estimate of BDA to the unit in contact. \nConsiderations for CCA and CAS Execution \n6-78. Aircraft leaders normally offset the battle position, attack or support by fire position from the flank \nof the friendly ground position. This helps to ensure that minimal interfere with operations on the ground. \nThe offset position allows the aircraft to engage the enemy on its flanks rather than its front. It reduces the \nrisk of fratricide along gun-target line. \n6-79. The engaging the target normally cannot be conducted without positive identification of friendly and \nenemy forces by both the ground and aviation commander before opening fire. The aviation element tailors \nits attack angles and weapon selections based upon the target and friendly unit proximity to the target. \n6-80. CCA and CAS can continue until the aircraft have expended all available munitions or fuel. \nHowever, if the air element receives a request for another attack, the pilot must carefully evaluate his \nability to extend the operation. If not able, the pilot calls for relief on station by another air element if \navailable.  \nChapter 6 \n6-14 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 20166-81. Clearance of fires considerations include―  \nEnsure aircrews have the current ACMs and FSCMs for indirect fire positions (to include\nmortars) supporting the ground tactical plan.\nPlan for informal airspace coordinating areas and check firing procedures and communications\nto ensure artillery and mortars firing from within the LZ do not endanger subsequent serials\nlanding or departing, CCA, or CAS.\nEnsure at least one of the aviation team members monitors the FS net for situational awareness.\nAdvise the aviation element if the location of indirect fire units changes from that planned.\nEnsure all participating units are briefed daily on current ACO or air tasking order changes and\nupdates that may affect air mission planning and execution.\nEnsure all units update firing unit locations, firing point origins, and final protective fire lines as\nthey change for inclusion in current ACO.\n6-82. After receiving the request for CAS/CCA the aircrew informs the ground maneuver force leader of \nthe battle position, attack- or suppo rt-by-fire position (or series of positions) the team is occupying, and the \nlocation from which the attack aircraft engages the enemy with direct fire. The size of this position varies \ndepending on the number of aircraft using the position, the size of the engagement area, and the type of \nterrain. The position must be close enough to the requesting unit to facilitate efficient target handover. \n6-83. The ground commander owning the terrain clears fires during the CCA by giving aircrews the \nsituational awareness of the location of friendly elements. The ground commander deconflicts the airspace \nbetween indirect fires, CAS, and the CCA aircraft. \nMETHODS TO DECONFLICT ON THE OBJECTIVE AREA \n6-84. The three methods to deconflict airspace for aircraft on the objective are described in the following \nparagraphs. \nGrid Line or Terrain Feature Separation \n6-85. This is the most restrictive but easiest method to execute. It may not allow the attack reconnaissance \nunits to engage targets in the CCA role during the air assault, but this technique is appropriate when time is \nlimited for rehearsals, or when prior planning is extremely limited or not possible. With this method, the \nattack reconnaissance units clear the airspace for inbound assault units by moving to a designated grid line \nor terrain feature on either side of the objective. This movement and the subsequent maneuver of the attack \nreconnaissance units in and around the objective area are executed according to the instructions in the \norder. (See figure 6-1 on page 6-15 .) \nAugmenting Combat Power \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 6-15 \nLegend:  ACP = air coordination point, LZ = landing zone, OBJ = objective, RP = release point, SP = start point \nFigure 6-1. Grid line method \nAttack- by-Fire Positioning \n6-86. Attack-by-fire positioning is the preferred method of deconfliction, as it allows attack reconnaissance \naircraft the greatest flexibility to engage targets during the air assault in support of the ground tactical \ncommander (GTC). The attack reconnaissance units occupy known attack-by-fire positions according to the \npublished OPORD. This method restricts the attack reconnaissance units to the general vicinity of the \nattack-by-fire positions but not to a specific grid. (See figure 6-2.)  \n6-87. The attack-by-fire positioning method requires the attack reconnaissance units to ensure they stay \nclear of the LZ and do not cross the centerline of the direction of flight. Using this method requires the \nattack reconnaissance aircraft to have increased situational awareness. This method is best used when all \nelements have adequate time to rehearse. \nChapter 6 \n6-16 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016\nLegend:  OBJ = objective \nFigure 6-2. Attack-by -fire method \nCall Clear \n6-88. The call clear method is used in contingency circumstances when assault or other aircraft (such as air \nmedical evacuation or mission command aircraft) are inbound to the objective area. It is initiated with an \ninbound call of the assault or other aircraft to the LZ and a response from the attack reconnaissance air \nmission command (AMC) indicating that all elements of the LZ and the flight path to it from the release \npoint (RP) are clear. Avoid using this method during the main air assault itself due to congestion on the air \nbattle net. \nASSESSING \nBATTLE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT AND REATTACK  \n6-89. After the attack aircraft complete the requested CCA mission, the aircrew provides a BDA to the \nground commander. Based on his intent, the ground maneuver commander determines if another attack is \nrequired to achieve his desired end state. \nRELEASE FROM SUPPORT /RETASKING  \n6-90. Upon identification that air support is no longer required the ground forces release the supporting air \nelements from bottom up echelons. Higher level echelons always have the authority to retask and reassign \nair assets based upon METT-TC. Lower levels ensure that support is met within their higher level \ncommander’s intent to support ground maneuver. The ground for ces do this by submitting closing reports \nafter air support is completed its tasks.  \nAugmenting Combat Power \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 6-17 RESPOND TO DOWNED AIRCRAFT \n6-91. Response to downed aircraft is always a planning consideration for all air assets and supported \nground forces. When an aircraft is downed the nearest ground element immediately moves to secure the \narea, recover personnel and equipment. Various echelons have differing tasks to support downed aircraft \nand personnel recovery. Typically the sequence of events goes in order of — \nDetermine location of downed aircraft.\nClosest ground element moves to site.\nSecure site and units rotate if needed to conduct follow on operations.\nSearch for missing personnel and equipment.\nDestroy items that cannot be recovered if needed based on METT-TC.\nForm a recovery team.\nRecover equipment.\nFollow up tasks and accountability of secondary effects.\nInvestigation for cause.\nImplement findings of investigation.\n6-92. Follow on operations will occur while the downed aircraft is being secured or recovered. The \nresponding unit must be aware of the actions they take as well as what they notice when they arrive onsite. \nThe timeliness of their response mitigates the effort and impact and scope of the follow operations. \nAIR MOVEMENT \n6-93. Air movement operations are conducted to reposition units, personnel, supplies, equipment, and other \ncritical combat elements in support of current or future operations. These operations include both airdrops \nand air landings. \n6-94. The SBCT conducts air movement with its vehicle by fixed wing. Each Stryker Infantry rifle \ncompany should have at least one trained unit movement officer. The Stryker vehicle have the following \nCapabilities and limitation for air movement: \nCapabilities:\nMany of the Stryker vehicles are able to be transported by C-130 and heavier aircraft.\nAbility to deploy rapidly for global response if lift assets are available.\nLimitations:\nThe Stryker vehicle cannot travel and land ready to fight. It requires fitting with additional\narmament, fueling, mission command system data upload and loading ammunition.\nThe aircraft carrying a Stryker vehicle require a secure airfield to land.\n6-95. Planning for air movements with the Stryker vehicles and without them is similar to that for other \nmissions. Besides the normal planning process, air movement planning need to cover specific requirements. \nThey are as follows: \nCoordinate with the supporting aviation unit(s).\nPlan and rehearse with the supporting aviation unit before the mission if possible. If armed\nescort accompanies the operation, the company commander —and the assault or general support\naviation unit —should ensure that aircrews are included in the planning and rehearsal.\nGather as much intelligence as possible, such as the enemy situation, in preparation for the\nmission.\nPlan and coordinate joint suppression of enemy air defense (J-SEAD).\n6-96. The unit should plan different ingress and egress routes, covering the following: \nPlanned insertion and extraction points.\nEmergency extraction rally points.\nLost communications extraction points.\nChapter 6 \n6-18 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  6-97. Planned extraction points and emergency extraction rally points require communications to verify the \npreplanned pickup time or coordinate an emergency pickup time window when dismounted. Planning need \nto include details for extraction when communications between higher headquarters and the unit are lost. \nThe lost communications extraction point involves infiltration teams moving to the emergency extraction \npoint after two consecutive missed communications windows and waiting up to 24 hours for pickup.  \nAIR RESUPPLY \n6-98. The SBCT Infantry rifle company and subordinate units may operate in forward locations and even \ndistant hide positions requiring helicopter resupply to include both internal and external load operations.  \n6-99. Planning for aerial resupply requires close coordination, with elements reviewing the entire mission \nand resolving all limitations and problem areas. If a resupply item poses a problem that cannot be resolved, \nleaders should consider another mode of transport. Planning factors include the following: \nPriorities of cargo/unit resupply.\nIntegration of the resupply operation into the tactical plan.\nSelection, identification, and marking of the PZ/LZ.\nType/amount of cargo.\nHelicopter assets available.\nRequirements for slings, cargo nets, or cargo containers.\nGround crew training requirements, such as those for ground guides and hookup personnel.\nPZ and LZ security.\nFlight routes.\n6-100. The selection of a usable PZ or LZ is extremely important. The company analyzes logistical and \ntactical considerations taking into account that PZ/LZ positioning is at the right place to support the ground \nunit. The area must be accessible to the aircraft involved in the resupply operation. The air mission \ncommander, the pilot in command, an aviation liaison officer (ALO), or a pathfinder-qualified officer or \nNCO make the final decision on PZ/LZ selection and acceptance. \n6-101. The SBCT Infantry rifle company receiving the supplies is responsible for preparing the PZ/LZ. \nBesides the general PZ/LZ responsibilities, Soldiers in the company perform the following specific tasks \nfor aerial resupply: \nRecover and assemble equipment and supplies.\nTrain available ground crews in guiding the aircraft during approach, landing,\nunloading/loading, departure, and de-rigging the load.\nTrain hookup personnel.\nCoordinate with t he sending unit for the control and return of that unit’s transport equipment\nsuch as slings and (aerial delivery cargo bag, NSN 1670-00-587-3421) A-22 bags.\nPrepare, coordinate, and inspect backloads, such as slings and A-22 bags, and have them ready\nfor hookup or loading when the aircraft arrives.\nSECTION V – MILITARY INFORMATION SUPPORT OPERATIONS (MISO) \n6-102. Military information support (MIS) forces provide the commander with an increased ability to \ndegrade the enemy’s will to fight, reduce civilian interfer ence, minimize collateral damage, and increase \nrelevant and local population support for operations. These forces operate as three 5-man teams, and are \nintegrated with maneuver units to conduct MISO in support of unified land operations. A staff sergeant \nleads the MIS team and advises the commander on the use of information, and is responsible for the \nintegration and employment of the team. The team leader serves as a planner in the absence of a MIS \nplanner on the supported unit’s staff.  \n6-103. Company commanders align themes and messages during operations that are nested with the \nSBCT commanders. Messages and themes that a company commander initiates should be submitted to their \nsupporting battalion and be analyzed by the MISO to determine the possible reach of the theme and \nmessage. Messages and themes often cross over company and battalion AOs. \nAugmenting Combat Power \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 6-19 CAPABILITIES \n6-104. MISO capabilities include — \nInfluencing foreign populations through planned messages, activities, and actions that target\nselect individuals and populations to affect decision making and change behavior.\nAdvising the commander on the psychological effects of military actions in the OE, and\nproviding cultural expertise.\nDelivering messages to intended audiences to inform, influence, and direct.\nCollecting, processing, and analyzing information to enhance the commander’s understanding\nof the OE and to facilitate decision making.\nTraining, advising, and assisting government organizations and security forces to establish\nHN/partner nation (PN) information capabilitie s.\nPLANNING CONSIDERATIONS \n6-105. Planning and employment considerations for MISO include — \nApproval authority. Messages and actions intended to influence foreign populations need to\ncomply with higher-level programs, plans, objectives, themes, and orders. The program\napproval may or may not authorize the GCC to further delegate approval authority to\nsubordinate Commanders as low as the brigade level for select products and actions. When\nthe BCT commander has this authority, he determines the length and timeliness of the\napproval process at his level. MIS element leaders are obligated to operate within the\nestablished approval process and to ensure the maneuver commander does not deliberately or\ninadvertently violate policies or the approval process.\nInterpreter. When language requirements exceed the abilities of the MIS team members, an\ninterpreter is required.\nSecurity. MIS teams rely on the supported unit to provide security.\nIntelligence. MISO activities require accurate, predictive, continuous, and timely intelligence\nto assess changes in decision making and actions.\nMobility. Mission analysis determines if organic transportation assets of the MIS team are\nadequate for the terrain to be navigated. Provisions for transporting team members,\nequipment, and products may be needed in difficult terrain or conditions.\nTHEMES, MESSAGES, AND ACTIONS \n6-106. Mission command requires the commander to use overarching information themes, supported by \nsynchronized messages, and integrated with complimentary actions to achieve a desired end state. In doing \nso, leaders personally engage key players to ensure the themes and messages are transmitted and received \nas the command intends. In an information-saturated environment, messages, themes, and actions are \ninextricably linked. Information as an element of combat power is a critical and sometimes decisive factor \nin mission success.  \n6-107. A message is a verbal, written, or electronic communications supporting an information theme \nfocused on an audience and in support of a specific action or objective. A psychological action (PSYACT) \nis planned for its psychological impact and conducted to influence decision making and subsequent actions \nof selected target audiences. (Refer to FM 3-13 and FM 3-53 for more information.) Accurate, timely, and \nsynchronized messages delivered to the right audiences and integrated with effective actions —increase the \npressure on the enemy. This is extremely important in dealing with friendly, neutral and threat audiences, \nand where synchronized and integrated actions and messages create significant opportunities to gain \nsupport for operations. \n6-108. Properly employed, information themes and messages can shape the OE and multiply the effects of \nfriendly successes while countering threat or enemy information efforts. An information theme usually \nproduced by the SBCT or higher, is a unifying or dominant idea or image expressing the purposes for an \naction. Company commanders should incorporate higher commanders’ themes and messages into all \nactions the company conducts. Proper employment of themes and messages begins during planning, \nChapter 6 \n6-20 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016continues through execution, and requires continuous assessment. Company commanders need to leverage \nall available assets in order to ensure both the appropriateness and best method of delivery of themes and \nmessages to the target audience within their AO. Additionally, during planning, company commanders \nshould establish a collection plan to assess the effectiveness and impact of the messages and themes within \ntheir AO. \nINFORMATION-RELATED CAPABILITIES \n6-109. Information-related capabilities of inform and influence activity is a military capability or activity \nspecifically designed to influence, inform, or inform and influence select leaders, decision makers, and \naudiences whose behaviors and perceptions are deemed integral to mission success. Information-related \ncapabilities of IIA are —public affairs (PA), military information support operations, Soldier and leader \nengagement, combat camera, military deception, CA operations, and operations security. \nPUBLIC AFFAIRS  \n6-110. PA effort factually and accurately informs various populations without intent to misinform or \nchange behaviors. It synchronizes components of PA with other IIA to ensure consistency, command \ncredibility, and operations security. (Refer to FM 3-61 for more information.) \nMILITARY INFORMATION SUPPORT OPERATIONS  \n6-111. MISO are planned operations to convey selected information and  indicators directed towards \nforeign , friendly, neutral, threat, and enemy audiences. (Refer to section VI of this chapter or FM 3-53 fo r \nmore information.) \nSOLDIER AND LEADER ENGAGEMENT  \n6-112. Soldier and leader engagement is interpersonal interactions by soldiers and leaders with audiences \nin an area of operations (FM 3-13). It can occur as an opportunity, a face-to -face encounter on the street, or \na scheduled meeting. This interaction can also occur via telephone calls, video teleconferences, or other \naudiovisual mediums. Soldier and leader engagement is an information-related capability that supports the \ncommanders’ responsibility to inform an d influence audiences inside and outside their organizations. \nSoldiers and leaders conduct engagement s to provide information or to influence attitudes, perceptions, and \nbehavior. These engagements provide a venue for building relationships, solving conflicts, conveying \ninformation, calming fears, and refuting rumors, lies, or incorrect information. Effectively integrating \nsoldier and leader engagement into operations increases the potential for commanders to mitigate \nunintended consequences, counter adversary information activities, and increase local support for friendly \nforces and their collective mission. (Refer to FM 3-13 for more information.) \n6-113. Face-to -face interaction by Soldiers and leaders strongly influences the perceptions of the local \npopulace. Carried out with discipline, professionalism, and cultural sensitivity, day-to -day interaction of \nSoldiers with the local populace among whom they operate has positive effects. Such interaction amplifies \npositive actions, counters threat information, and increases goodwill and support for friendly missions. \nActions in keeping with the commander’s themes and messages demonstrated during operations provide an \nopportunity for persuasion, and reduce friction and mistrust. When conducting these meetings or \nengagem ents, never promise something you can’t deliver.  \n6-114. Likewise, meetings and other engagements conducted by leaders with key communicators, civilian \nleaders, or others whose perceptions, decisions, and actions will affect mission accomplishment can be \ncritical to mission success. These deliberate engagements provide the most convincing venue for conveying \npositive information, assuaging fears, and refuting rumors, lies, and misinformation. Conducted with \ndetailed preparation and planning, both activities often prove crucial in garnering local support for Army \noperations, providing an opportunity for persuasion, and reducing friction and mistrust. Never promise \nsomething you can’t deliver.  \n6-115. SBCT Infantry rifle company commander and subordinate leaders use information shaped by \nintelligence to inform, influence, and persuades the local populace within limits prescribed by their higher \nheadquarters, other authoritative guidance, and U.S. law. They integrate inform and influence with stability \ntasks. They do this to counter false and distorted information and propaganda according guidance of higher \nAugmenting Combat Power \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 6-21 headquarters. Within the limits of OPSEC, leaders make the populace aware of the techniques used to \nprovide security and control. Actions on the ground reinforced by a clear and consistent message produce \ntransparency. This transparency reinforces credibility. Credibility reflects the populace’s assessment of \nwhether the force can accomplish the mission. Leaders must leave no doubt as to their capability and \nintentions. \n6-116. SBCT Infantry rifle company leaders are not restricted to the above listed components when \nconducting IIA and may add or subtract information-related capabilities as the situation dictates. \nInformation-related capabilities can support IIA include combat camera, CA operations, \ncyber/electromagnetic activities, operations security, and other military actions as designated by the \ncompany commander. (Refer to FM 3-13 for more information.) \nCONDUCT NEGOTIATIONS  \n6-117. The SBCT Infantry rifle company, platoon, and squad may face a number of situations in which \nleaders need to conduct negotiations. There are two general types of negotiations, situational and planned. \nUnits conduct situational negotiations in response to a requirement for on-the-spot discussion and \nresolution of a specific issue or problem. (Example, a unit is patrolling its AO when a local official \napproaches it; the local official wishes to discuss an assault that occurred in the area.) Units conduct \nplanned negotiations when they foresee a problem, or identify a situation that needs to be resolved through \nadvanced planning or coordination. (Example, the platoon leader conducts a coordination meeting, \notherwise known as key leader engagement between leaders of two belligerent groups to determine route \nclearance responsibilities.) \n6-118. At the SBCT Infantry rifle company platoon and squad level, situational negotiations are far more \ncommon than the planned type. In fact, employment in stability tasks requires the leader, his subordinate \nleaders, and other Soldiers to conduct some form of negotiations almost daily. This in turn requires them to \nhave a thorough understanding of the ROE, rules of interaction (ROI), and understanding of themes and \nmessages from the higher command.  \n6-119. Members of the SBCT Infantry rifle company, platoon, and squad apply this working knowledge \nto the process of discussing and, whenever possible, resolving issues and problems may arise between \nopposing parties, which may include the platoon itself. A critical aspect of this knowledge is the \nnegotia tor’s ability to recognize that he has exhausted his options under the ROE/ROI and turned the \ndiscussion over to a higher authority. Negotiations continue at progressive levels of authority until the issue \nis resolved. \nCOMBAT CAMERA  \n6-120. Combat camera units provide a powerful documentary and supports the components of inform and \ninfluence activities. Combat camera provides leaders with a directed imagery capability to DSCA \noperational and planning requirements. These forces use video documentation capabilities ranging from \naerial photography to underwater photography to support IIA. They access areas and events inaccessible to \nother personnel or media. Furthermore, combat camera teams have a technological capability to transmit \nreal-time images. The accurate portrayal provided by U.S. forces in action enables IIA section to reinforce \nother information-related capability efforts. Likewise, their documentation of operations and provided \nimagery products support countering misinformation or propaganda. (Refer to ATP 3-55.12/ \nMCRP 3-33.7A/NTTP 3-61.2/AFTTP 3-2.41 for more information.) \nMILITARY DECEPTION  \n6-121. Military deception involves actions executed to deliberately mislead threat military, paramilitary, \nor violent extremist organization decision makers. This information-related capability intends the threat to \ntake specific actions (or inactions) contributing to accomplishment of the friendly mission. Military \ndeception does not fall under the direct purview of the S-7 but is considered a primary influencing \ncapability of IIA. \n6-122. Military deception comprises counter deception, deception in support of operations security, and \ntactical deception.  \nChapter 6 \n6-22 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016CYBER ELECTROMAGNETIC ACTIVITIES  \n6-123. Given the dependence on cyberspace and the electromagnetic spectrum, leaders at all levels fully \nintegrate cyber/electromagnetic activities within the overall operation. The components of \ncyber/electromagnetic activities are —cyber situational awareness, network operations, cyber warfare, \nelectronic attack, electronic protection, electronic support, and electromagnetic spectrum operations. (Refer \nto ATP 3-36 for more information.) \nOPERATIONS SECURITY  \n6-124. Operations security information- related capabilities deny threat and enemy’s information in turn \ninfluences their decision making process. Operations security is the process by which the Army protects \nhuman and automated decision making in peacetime and in conflict. It is a commander’s responsibility and \nis supported by every Soldier and supporting civilian staff members and operators. Operations security \naims to enhance the probability of mission success by preserving the advantages of initiative secrecy and \nsurprise. Operations security is a force multiplier. It includes reducing predictability and eliminating \nindicators of operations. Leaders use operations security countermeasures to deny threat knowledge of \nfriendly operations, requiring threat to expend further resources to obtain the critical information needed to \nmake decisions. (Refer to FM 3-13 for more information.)  \nSECTION VI – SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES \n6-125. Special Forces (SF) may operate with the Infantry or within the Infantry area of operation and with \nInfantry units conducting operations inside a joint special operations area. Physical contact between \nInfantry units and SF operation may range from short-term direct action operations to sustained combat \noperations. It is essential to conduct adequate coordination and integration to accomplish the specific \nmission. Special forces operations have several elements to aid in coordination at the battalion level and \nabove.  \n6-126. As part of the SBCT, the Infantry may conduct operations with or in support of SOF in the OE. \nDetailed planning and coordination may be required. In today’s OE, the company may find SOF operating \nwithin or near its area of operation. To maximize their combined combat power, these forces need to share \nan appreciation and understanding of each other‘s mission, purpose, capabilities, and limitations. For more \ninformation. (Refer to ADP 3-05, ADRP 3-05, and FM 3-05 for more information.) \n6-127. When operating with or near SOF, the SBCT Infantry rifle company commander should \ncoordinate, at a minimum, the following with the SOF unit leader: \nMission command relationship.\nCommunication information (frequencies, call signs, challenge and passwords, emergency\nsignals and codes).\nSafe house locations.\nNumber and types of vehicles.\nControl measures being used.\nBattle handover criteria.\nLiaisons.\nSustainment plans.\nContingency plans for mutual support.\nSECTION VII – CIVIL AFFAIRS \n6-128. CA activities performed or supported by CA personnel and organizations enhance the relationship \nbetween military forces and civil authorities in areas where military forces are present. The goal is to \nfacilitate military operations and to consolidate and achieve U.S. objectives. These activities may occur \nbefore, during, or after military actions. They may occur, if directed, in the absence of other military \noperations. CA support relates to the mission command warfighting function.  \nAugmenting Combat Power \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 6-23 CIVIL-MILITARY OPERATIONS \n6-129. Tactical-level civil-military operations (CMO) include support of stakeholders at local levels, and \npromoting the legitimacy and effectiveness of U.S. presence and operations between locals, while \nminimizing friction between the military and the civilian organizations in the field. These may include local \nsecurity operations, processing, and movement of displaced civilians, project management and project \nnomination, civil reconnaissance, and basic HSS. (Refer to JP 3-57 for more information.) \nCIVIL AFFAIRS \n6-130. Civil affairs operations (CAO) are those military operations planned, supported, or executed by \nCA forces to enhance CMO in support of unified land operations. The purpose of CA operations is to \nmodify behaviors and mitigate or defeat threats to civil society. Civil affairs tasks include population and \nresource control (PRC), foreign humanitarian assistance (FHA), civil information management (CIM), \nnation assistance (NA), and support to civil administration (SCA). Though these tasks are conducted \nthroughout the range of unified land operations, they are fundamental to executing stability tasks. \n6-131. At the tactical level, the primary focus of function of CA forces is to plan, assess, and enable local \nstabilization activities. Stability tasks emphasize nonlethal, constructive actions by Soldiers working \nbetween noncombatants. In operations focused on stability tasks, CA forces work with and through HN \nagencies and other civilian organizations to enhance the HN government’s legitimacy. Often, CA teams \nwork with company commanders and Platoon s to coordinate civil military operations within the company’s \nAO. Company leadership should coordinate with civil affairs units to ensure efforts are nested and mutually \nsupporting. A framework for evaluating civil considerations is areas, structures, capabilities, organizations, \npeople, and events (ASCOPE). (Refer to ATP 2-01.3 for more information.) Each consideration is \ndescribed as follows: \nAreas. Determine the geographic variations in the area of responsibility, their potential\nmilitary impact, and how they influence how people live.\nStructures. Describe the man-made structures in which the people live and work; determine\nthose having cultural, religious, and economic significance.\nCapabilities. Determine the ability of various groups to influence the AO and the rest of the\npopulation relative to their possible intent to do so-determine economic and military potential\ngiven the areas and infrastructure.\nOrganizations. Determine what informal and formal social, religious, familial, or political\norganizations exist and what their intent, purpose, and resources are.\nPeople. Determine how the population aligns with organizations and one another; determine if\nthey are likely to be supportive, detrimental, or neutral to the unit’s mission.\nEvents. Create significant population event template and determine if future activity can be\npredicted based on pattern analysis.\n6-132. While CA forces are organized, trained, and equipped specifically to support CMO, other enablers \nperforming CMO include MISO, SOF, legal support, PA, engineer, transportation, HSS, military police \n(MP), security forces, and maneuver units.  \nCIVIL AFFAIRS UNITS \n6-133. CA units establish, maintain, influence, or exploit relations between military forces and the \nindigenous populations and institutions where military forces are located. CA units conduct CAO in \ncoordination with civil authorities (both government and nongovernment) and the civil populace in a \nfriendly, neutral, or hostile AO. This coordination facilitates military operations and consolidates civ il \ncomponent operational objectives. CA units are designed for employment independently, attached OPCON, \nor tactical control (TACON) to other forces. The most commonly encountered element from a CA \norganization is civil affairs team alpha (CAT). The CAT is structured to assess and provide \nrecommendations on the immediate needs of the HN indigenous populations and institutions by executing \nCAO in support of the commanders’ operations plan. At the platoon level, the typical relationship with the \nCATs is one of providing security support during CAO in high threat areas. \nChapter 6 \n6-24 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  CAPABILITIES \n6-134. The CA company is organized to — \nProvide a civil-military operations center (CMOC) with tactical-level planning, management,\ncoordination, and synchronization of CAO capability withi n the supported commander’s AO.\nProvide communications capability that links directly into the supported unit’s\ncommunications architecture.\nProvide CATs in support of elements of the supported command capable of conducting civil\nreconnaissance (CR) and executing tactical level CAO.\nFacilitate integration of civil component input into the supported command’s COP.\nCollate, analyze, and fuse civil information for input to the supported command’s COP.\nFUNCTIONS  \n6-135. The functions of the CAT are to — \nConduct CR.\nEngage key leaders by constantly vetting contacts to identify elites within the CAT’s AO.\nPlan, coordinate, and enable CAO and project management.\nProvide civil information and recommendations to the supported unit and CMOC for\ninclusion in the running estimates that support the civil component of the supported\ncommander’s COP.\nEMPLOYMENT  \n6-136. The CAT can be deployed to — \nRemain rapidly deployable.\nProvide CAO staff augmentation and CA planning and assessment support to tactical\nmaneuver commanders.\nMaintain direct data and voice communications with conventional, SOF, indigenous\npopulation and institutions (IPI), intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), NGOs, and\ninteragency elements with classified and unclassified connectivity.\nSupport CMO conducted by military forces.\nConduct liaison with civilian authorities and key leaders.\nMinimize interference between civil and military operations.\nConduct area studies and area assessments.\nAssist the intelligence staff section (S-2) and other staff members with civil considerations\nanalysis supporting preparation of the operational environment, as required.\nMaintain the ability to operate independently in remote and austere environments.\n6-137. CA forces coordinate with military and civilian agencies. CA forces have extensive capabilities in \nall forms of communications; thus, requiring little, if any, augmentation from the supported command. By \ntable of organization and equipment (TO&E), CA units are authorized the latest in conventional and special \noperations (SO) communications equipment and computers. This allows them to send secured and \nunsecured internet communication, over-the-horizon (OTH) radios, satellite-capable radios, and laptop \ncomputers with internet access. CA units need to be equipped with the current and most common civilian \ncommunications equipment to allow them to interface with IGOs, NGOs, and IPI in the AO. Specific \nrequirements beyond these capabilities are determined during mission analysis and forwarded to the \nsupported command as a statement of requirements (SOR). \nAugmenting Combat Power \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 6-25 LIMITATIONS  \n6-138. The small size of CA elements may require a security force to conduct CAO. This security is \ndependent upon theater and mission requirements. It is critical that sufficient security is available to \nprovide protection and is coordinated with the CAT conducting CAO in support of the commander’s CMO \nplan. CA companies and CATs do not have organic maintenance assets and require maintenance support \nfrom the unit they are attached to for operations. \nThis page intentionally left blank.   \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 7-1 Chapter 7 \nEnabling Operations \nTactical enabling operations are specialized missions that units plan and conduct to \nachieve or sustain a tactical advantage. Units execute these operations as part of \noffensive, defensive, or stability tasks. The fluid nature of OE increases the frequency \nwith which the SBCT Infantry rifle company conducts these tactical operations. This \nchapter discusses assembly area operations, reconnaissance, security, patrols, relief in \nplace, passage of lines, linkup operations, breaching operations, gap crossing and \ntroop movement. \nSECTION I – ASSEMBLY AREA \n7-1. An assembly area  is an area a unit occupies to prepare for an operation (FM 3-90-1). Ideally, an \nassembly area provides — \nConcealment from air and ground observation.\nAdequate entrances, exits, and internal routes.\nSpace for dispersion; each assembly area is separated by enough distance from other assembly\nareas to avoid mutual interference.\nCover from direct fire.\nGood drainage and soil conditions that can sustain the movement of the unit vehicles and\nindividual Soldier.\nTerrain masking of electromagnetic signatures.\nTerrain allowing observation of ground and air avenues into the assembly area.\nSanctuary from enemy medium-range artillery fires because it is loca ted outside the enemy’s\nrange.\n7-2. The proper location of assembly areas contributes significantly to both security and flexibility. It \nshould facilitate future operations so movement to subsequent positions can take place smoothly and \nquickly by concealed routes. The tactical mobility of the SBCT Infantry rifle company units allows it to \noccupy assembly areas at greater distances from the LD. \nQUARTERING PARTY EMPLOYMENT \n7-3. Usually, the SBCT Infantry rifle company employs a quartering party (also known as an advan ce \nparty) to assist in the occupation of an assembly area. A quartering party  is a group of unit representatives \ndispatched to a probable new site of operations in advance of the main body to secure, reconnoiter, and \norganize an area prior to the main body ’s arrival and occupation ( FM 3-90-2).  \n7-4. The SBCT Infantry rifle company establishes the quartering party according to their SOPs. For \nexample, the quartering party could consist of one vehicle from a platoon and a vehicle from the \nheadquarters section. The SBCT Infantry rifle company XO, 1SG, or a senior NCO usually leads the \nquartering party. The quartering party’s actions at the assembly area include the following:  \nReconnoiter for enemy forces and CBRN contamination.\nEvaluate the condition of the route leading into the assembly area and the suitability of the area\n(drainage, space, internal routes).\nOrganize the area based on the commander’s guidance; designate and mark tentative locations\nfor platoons’ vehicles, command post vehicles, and trains.\nChapter 7 \n7-2 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  Improve and mark entrances, exits, and internal routes.\nMark bypass es or removes obstacles (within the party’s capabilities).\nDevelop digital assembly area overlay and send overlays to SBCT Infantry rifle company main\nbody and SBCT Infantry battalion main command post.\nOCCUPATION OF THE ASSEMBLY AREA \n7-5. Once the quartering party finishes preparing the assembly area, the quartering party awaits the arrival \nof the SBCT Infantry rifle company main body, maintaining surveillance and providing security of the area \nwithin its capabilities. The main body  is the principal part of a tactical command or formation. It does not \ninclude detached elements of the command, such as advance guards, flank guards, and covering forces. \n(FM 3-90-1). SOPs and guides assist vehicle commanders to quickly find their positions, clear the route, \nand assume designated positions in the assembly area. (See figure 7-1 on page 7-3) \n7-6. The SBCT Infantry rifle company may occupy the assembly area as an independent element or as \npart of the SBCT Infantry battalion. In either situation, the company occupies its positions upon arrival \nusing the procedures for hasty occupation of a BP. The commander establishes local security and \ncoordinates with adjacent units. He assigns weapons orientation and sector of fire for each platoon and \nsubordinate element. If the SBCT Infantry rifle company occupies the assembly area alone, it establishes a \nperimeter defense. \nLegend:  AA = avenue of approach, CDR = commander, FIST = fire integration support team, MAINT = \nmaintenance, MEDEVAC = medical evacuation, MGS = mobile gun system, MTRS = mortars, XO = executive \nofficer \nFigure 7-1. SBCT Infantry rifle company assembly area \nEnabling Operations \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 7-3 ACTIONS IN THE ASSEMBLY AREA \n7-7. Following occupation of the assembly area, the SBCT Infantry rifle company prepares for future \noperations by conducting TLPs and priorities of work according to the SBCT Infantry battalion and the \nSBCT Infantry rifle company OPORDs. These preparations include the following: \nEstablish and maintain security (at the appropriate readiness level).\nDevelop a defensive fire plan and forward it to the SBCT Infantry battalions main CP via\nBFT/JCR, if equipped.\nEmploy SBCT Infantry rifle squads to conduct dismounted security patrols to clear dead space\nand restrictive terrain.\nConduct TLP.\nConduct precombat checks (PCC) and PCI based on time available.\nPerform maintenance on vehicles and communications equipment.\nVerify weapons system status; conduct bore sighting, prepare-to -fire checks, test-firing, and\nother necessary preparations.\nNote. The SBCT Infantry rifle company usually coordinates test firing with its higher \nheadquarters. \nWeapons control status\nConduct resupply, refueling and rearming operations.\nConduct rehearsals and other training for upcoming operations.\nConduct personal care and hygiene activities.\nAdjust task organization as needed.\nAccount for SBCT Infantry rifle company personnel, to include attachments and sensitive items.\nReestablish vehicle load plans as needed.\nACTIONS IN THE ASSEMBLY AREA \n7-8. Following occupation of the assembly area, the SBCT Infantry rifle company prepares for future \noperations by conducting TLPs and priorities of work according to the SBCT Infantry battalion and the \nSBCT Infantry rifle company OPORDs.

Reconnaissance  is a mission undertaken to obtain, by visual observation or other detection methods, \ninformation about the activities and resources of an enemy or adversary potential enemy, or to secure data \nconcerning the meteorological, hydrographical, or geographical characteristics and the indigenous \npopulation of a particular area. Reconnaissance primarily relies on the human dynamic rather than technical \nmeans. (Refer to FM 3-90-2 for more information.) \n7-10. Reconnaissance identifies terrain characteristics, enemy and friendly obstacles to movement, and the \ndisposition of enemy forces and civilian population so the platoon leader can maneuver his forces freely \nand rapidly. Reconnaissance before unit movements and occupation of assembly areas is critical to \nprotecting the force and preserving combat power. It keeps the force free from contact as long as possible \nso that it can concentrate on its decisive operation. \n7-11. Reconnaissance can be passive or active. Passive reconnaissance includes such techniques as map \nand photographic reconnaissance and surveillance. Active methods available to the SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany include mounted and dismounted ground reconnaissance and reconnaissance by fire. Active \nreconnaissance operations are classified as stealthy or aggressive. The SBCT Infantry rifle company \nconducts its reconnaissance operations in close contact with the enemy and civilians, and is capable to fight \nfor information, consolidate gains, and maintain continuous reconnaissance. Companies use all available \nassets in information collection to gain the most information to be analyzed. \n7-12. Human interactions, whomever they are with are crucial to information collection as well. Once trust \nis built amongst the population and HNSF more information is likely to be obtained. It is important to not \njust rely on technology, but to interact one on one with the population and HNSF to build relationships and \ntrust. \nRECONNAISSANCE FUNDAMENTALS \n7-13. The fundamentals of successful reconnaissance operations are as follows: \nEnsure continuous reconnaissance.\nDo not keep reconnaissance assets in reserve.\nOrient on the reconnaissance objective.\nReport information rapidly and accurately.\nRetain freedom of maneuver.\nGain and maintain enemy contact.\nDevelop the situation rapidly.\n7-14. Effective reconnaissance is continuous. The SBCT Infantry rifle company conducts reconnaissance \nbefore, during, and after all operations. Before an operation, reconnaissance focuses on filling gaps in \nintelligence about the enemy and terrain. During an operation, reconnaissance focuses on providing the \ncommander with updated information that verifies the enemy’s composition, dispositions, an d intentions as \nthe operation progresses. After an operation, reconnaissance focuses on maintaining contact with the enemy \nto determine his next move and collecting intelligence necessary for planning subsequent operations. \n7-15. Reconnaissance assets are never kept in reserve. When committed, reconnaissance assets use all of \ntheir resources to accomplish the mission. This does not mean that all assets are committed all the time. \nThe commander uses his reconnaissance assets based on their capabilities and mission variables to achieve \nthe maximum coverage needed to answer the CCIRs. \n7-16. The commander uses the reconnaissance objective to coordinate his unit’s reconnaissance efforts. \nThe reconnaissance objective is a terrain feature, geographic area, or an enemy about which the commander \nwants to obtain additional information ( FM 3-90-1).  \nEnabling Operations \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 7-5 7-17. Reconnaissance assets acquire and report accurate and timely combat information about the enemy, \ncivil considerations, and the terrain over which operations are to be conducted. Combat information may \nquickly lose its value. Reconnaissance assets report exactly what they see and, if appropriate, what they do \nnot see. \n7-18. Reconnaissance assets retain mobility to successfully complete their missions. If these assets are \ndecisively engaged, reconnaissance stops and a fight for survival begins. Reconnaissance assets have clear \nengagement criteria that support the commander’s intent. They employ proper movement and \nreconnaissance techniques, use overwatching fires, and SOPs.  \n7-19. Once a unit conducting reconnaissance gains contact with the enemy, it maintains that contact unless \nthe commander directing the reconnaissance orders otherwise or the survival of the unit is at risk. This does \nnot mean that individual scout and reconnaissance teams cannot break contact with the enemy. The \ncommander of the unit conducting reconnaissance is responsible for maintaining contact using all available \nresources.  \n7-20. When a reconnaissance asset encounters an enemy force or an obstacle, it quickly determines the \nthreat it faces. For an enemy force, it determines the enemy’s composition, dispositions, activities, and \nmovements and assesses the implications of that combat information. For an obstacle, it determines the \ntype and extent of the obstacle and whether it is covered by fire. Obstacles can provide the attacker with \ncombat information concerning the location of enemy forces, weapon capabilities, and organization of \nfires. \nFORMS OF RECONNAISSA NCE  \n7-21. The forms of reconnaissance operations are—  \nZone.\nArea.\nRoute.\nReconnaissance in force (RIF).\nSpecial (normally conducted by SOF).\nZONE RECONNAISSANCE  \n7-22. A zone reconnaissance  is a directed effort to obtain detailed information concerning all routes, \nterrain, enemy forces, and obstacles to include areas of chemical and radiological contamination within a \nzone defined by specific boundaries (FM 3-90-2). Companies do not usually conduct zone reconnaissance \nbecause of the troops to task requirements and timeliness of the information by the higher unit. Zone \nreconnaissance is executed when the enemy situation is vague, or when information concerning cross-\ncountry trafficability is required. (Refer to ADRP 3 -90 for more information.) The Stryker Infantry rifle \ncompany uses reconnaissance patrols as the primary method during conduct zone reconnaissance mission \nwith consideration that enemy situation is not fully developed. The SBCT Infantry rifle company normally \nrequires augmentation from engineers, CBRN reconnaissance platoon, human intelligence (HUMINT) and \ncivil affairs team to answer detailed information about the civilian population, bridges, infrastructure or \nCBRN hazard area. Similar to route reconnaissance, mission variables and the commander’ s intent dictate \nthe SBCT Infantry rifle c ompany’s actions during a zone reconnaissance.  \n7-23. Zone reconnaissance tasks are as follows: \nFind and report all enemy forces within the zone.\nClear all enemy forces in the designated AO within the capability of the unit conducting\nreconnaissance.\nDetermine the trafficability of all terrain within the zone, to include built-up areas.\nLocate and determine the extent of all contaminated areas in the zone.\nEvaluate and classify all bridges, defiles, overpasses, underpasses, and culverts in the zone.\nLocate any fords, crossing sites, or bypasses, and reinforcing obstacles to include built-up areas\nin the zone.\nLocate all obstacles and create lanes as specified in execution orders.\nChapter 7 \n7-6 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016Report the above information to the commander directing the zone reconnaissance, to include\nproviding a sketch map or overlay.\nAREA RECONNAISSANCE  \n7-24. Area reconnaissance  is a form of reconnaissance that focuses on obtained detailed information about \nthe terrain or enemy activity within a prescribed area ( FM 3-90-2). The area can be any location that is \ncritical to the unit’s operations. Examples include easily identifiable areas covering a large space (suc h as \ntowns or military installations), terrain features (ridgelines, wood lines, choke points), or a specific point (a \nbridge or a building).  \n7-25. Additional assets for signal information , imagery intelligence (IMINT), HUMINT, with a ll-source \nintelligence reside within the management information control office (MICO) to assist in area \nreconnaissance. By accessing these assets would increase the ability to detect potential enemy threats or \nprovide early warning. Maintaining SA and requesting intelligence reports for specific areas in a routine or \ntimely manner provide a better operational understanding before conducting area reconnaissance. The tasks \nof an area reconnaissance are the same as those for a zone reconnaissance and are conducted in the same \nmanner. (See figure 7-2 .) \nLegend:  NAI = named area of interest, OBJ = objective, PL = phase line \nFigure 7-2. SBCT Infantry rifle company area reconnaissance \nROUTE RECONNAISSANCE  \n7-26. Route reconnaissance  is a form of reconnaissance that focuses along a specific line o f \ncommunication, such as a road, railway, or cross-country mobility corridor ( FM 3-90-2). A route \nEnabling Operations \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 7-7 reconnaissance is a directed effort to obtain detailed information on a specific route and on all terrain from \nwhich the enemy can influence movement along that route. A route reconnaissance is usually conducted \nwhen the commander wants to use the route in question. Trafficable routes are made easier to determine in \nan SBCT because the Stryker vehicles are made of the same chassis. Consideration will include th e heavy \nexpanded mobile tactical truck (HEMTT) cargo is the largest and heaviest vehicle for logistics organic to \nthe SBCT.  \n7-27. Route reconnaissance tasks are as follows: \nFind, report, and clear all enemy elements that can influence movement along the route.\nDetermine the trafficability of the route; can it support the friendly force?\nReconnoiter all terrain that the enemy can use to dominate movement along the route, such as\nchoke points, ambush sites, and PZs, LZs, and drop zones (DZs).\nReconnoiter all built-up areas, contaminated areas, and lateral routes along the route.\nEvaluate and classify all bridges, defiles, overpasses and underpasses, and culverts along the\nroute.\nLocate any fords, crossing sites, or bypasses, and reinforcing obstacles to include built-up areas\nalong the route.\nLocate all obstacles, interdict and reduce IED/UXO and create lanes as specified in execution\norders.\nReport the above route intelligence to the headquarters initiating the route reconnaissance\nmission, to include providing a sketch map or a route overlay.\n7-28. SBCT Infantry rifle company conducts route reconnaissance primarily with its Infantry platoons \naugmented with engineers to support bridge classification. They use Infantry to gather information along \nthe route by deploying at specific points. These points are usually road intersections, bridges, culverts, hills, \nover passes, and under passes. (See figure 7-3 .) \nChapter 7 \n7-8 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  \nLegend:  CP = check point, LD = line of departure, LOA = limit of advance, RP = rally point, SP = start point \nFigure 7-3. Route reconnaissance using fans \nRECONNAISSANCE IN FORCE  \n7-29. Reconnaissance in force  is a deliberate combat operation designed to discover or test the ene my’s \nstrength, dispositions, and reactions or to obtain other information (ADRP 3-90). Battalion-sized task \nforces or larger organization usually conduct a reconnaissance in force mission. The SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany will not conduct a reconnaissance in force independently, but may participate as part of a larger \nforce. \nTASK ORGANIZATION  \n7-30. The SBCT Infantry rifle company can conduct route-, zone-, or area-reconnaissance. The SBCT \nInfantry rifle company may conduct a reconnaissance during preparation for another operation of its own \n(for example, performing area reconnaissance before initiating an attack); or it can conduct the \nreconnaissance to gain information for a higher headquarters. Usually, the company is task-organized with \nengineer, HUMINT, information collection assets, and UAS platforms as needed to meet the requirements \nof the reconnaissance. \nEnabling Operations \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 7-9 PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS  \n7-31. Reconnaissance planning starts with the commander identifying the CCIR. This process may be \nconducted while the unit is planning or preparing for an operation; in many cases, it continues throughout \nthe operation. The SBCT Infantry rifle company commander outlines the following: \nReconnaissance objective. Enables subordinates to prioritize tasking and narrow their scope of\noperations.\nDecision points. Link DPs to enemy actions.\nTempo. Outlines the time requirements the commander envisions for the reconnaissance force\nand expresses them in order, outlines the degree of completeness, the degree of covertness, and\nthe risk the commander is willing to accept. The commander knows that he accepts increased\nrisk to both the reconnaissance element and the main body when he accelerates the pace of\nreconnaissance. This risk can be somewhat offset by employing air reconnaissance and technical\nmeans to cover open terrain or areas of lower threat.\nEngagement criteria. Establishes the size or type of enemy forces the commander expects his\nreconnaissance force to engage, and at the expected level of force. This helps leaders to plan\ndirect and indirect fires, and establish bypass criteria.\n7-32. The commander considers METT-TC as he plans for mounted, dismounted, aircraft, or combinations \nof these methods of reconnaissance. Conditions that can result in a decision to conduct mounted, \ndismounted, or aircraft reconnaissance include the following: \nTime constraints.\nRequired detail level of reconnaissance.\nAvailability of air units to perform coordinated reconnaissance with ground assets.\nIPB.\nAvenues of approach that support friendly movement and exploit enemy weaknesses.\nKey positions, especially flanks that can be exploited.\nOPs.\nType of terrain.\nEnvironmental conditions, such as deep snow and muddy terrain that greatly hinder mounted\nreconnaissance.\n7-33. The commander considers employing UASs for ground reconnaissance. UASs provide the \ncommander with essential terrain and enemy information. Most UASs can operate in daylight or limited \nvisibility, and are difficult to detect or shoot down. (Refer to FM 3-04.155 for more information.) \n7-34. Leaders at all echelons coordinate and synchronize reconnaissance efforts. The commander selects \nformation changes dependent on enemy and terrain. Leaders control the movement of the forces changing \nbetween traveling, traveling overwatch and bounding overwatch as they approach the probable line of \ncontact and the reconnaissance objective. The key point is to use reconnaissance assets based on their \ncapabilities, and use their complementary capabilities to verify and expand on available intelligence.  \n7-35. Sustainment planning is indispensable throughout the planning process. The commander assesses all \nconstraints and considers the following: \nResupply procedures for both mounted and dismounted reconnaissance missions.\nPredetermined locations and times for resupply of Classes I, III, IV, V, VII, and IX.\nResupply considerations for Class VIII.\nReviews TTPs for casualty extraction and MEDEVAC.\nPickup points and times for pickup and aerial extraction of casualties.\nReview TTPs for vehicle recovery procedures.\nFIRE SUPPORT  \n7-36. The commander asks the following questions as he prepares his fire support plan: \nWhere are the enemy target acquisition assets (such as radar)?\nChapter 7 \n7-10 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016Where will the enemy deploy his artillery? This intelligence helps plan direct and indirect\ncounter fires.\nWhat are the HVT?\nWhat are the HPT that were developed during the war-gaming or targeting processes?\nWhat is the range of the enemy’s indirect fires? This intelligence helps plan direct and indirect\nfires, and establishes bypass criteria.\nSECTION III – SECURITY \n7-37. Security operations are those operations undertaken by the commander to provide early and accurate \nwarning of enemy operations, to provide the force being protected with time and maneuver space within \nwhich to react to the enemy, and to develop the situation to allow the commander to effectively use the \nprotected force (ADRP 3-90). Security operations enable the commander to detect enemy operations, \nprotect another unit, and develop the situation. Security operations include reconnaissance aimed at \nreducing terrain and enemy unknowns; gaining and maintaining contact with the enemy to ensure \ncontinuous information collection; and providing early and accurate reporting of combat information to the \nprotected force. Security forces orient in any direction from a stationary or moving force.  \nFUNDAMENTALS OF SECURITY OPERATIONS \n7-38. The five fundamentals of security operations are — \nProvide early and accurate warning.\nProvide reaction time and maneuver space.\nOrient on the force, area, or facility to be protected.\nPerform continuous reconnaissance.\nMaintain enemy contact.\nPROVIDE EARLY AND ACCURATE WARNING  \n7-39. The security force provides early and accurate warning by detecting the threat force quickly an d \nreporting combat information accurately to the commander. Early warning of threat activity provides the \ncommander with the time, space, and intelligence he needs to retain the tactical initiative and to choose the \ntime and place to concentrate against the threat. Placement of communication specifically retransmission \n(RETRANs) stations is vital to establishing long-range communication with higher and adjacent units. At a \nminimum, the security force should operate far enough from the main body to prevent enemy ground forces \nfrom observing or engaging the main body with direct fire. Positions maneuver forces, sensors, and tactical \nUASs to provide long –range observation of expected threat avenues of approach. Long-range observation \ncan be enhanced by the use of Stryker vehicle optics particularly with the MGS thermal images. \n7-40. In stability tasks, providing early and accurate warning is much harder to achieve. In many cases, \nthreat personnel in the AO are indistinguishable from civilian noncombatants. They might elude positive \nidentification as a threat until their actions reveal them as such. This fundamental may be expressed in the \nstability environment in the following ways: \nIdentification of and regular communication with key civil and religious leaders.\nContinuous surveillance of known or suspected enemy meeting locations.\nProactive, friendly engagement with the indigenous population to ascertain threat developments\nin their community that may otherwise be transparent to the unit.\nPROVIDE REACTION TIME AND MANEUVER SPACE  \n7-41. The security force operates as far from the protected force as possible within supporting range of the \nprotected force, consistent with METT-TC. More distance usually yields greater reaction time and \nmaneuver space for the protected force commander, provided communications are maintained. The security \nforce fights as needed to gain and retain adequate time and space for the protected force commander, \nallowing him to maneuver and concentrate forces to counter the threat. \nEnabling Operations \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 7-11 ORIENT ON THE FORCE , AREA, OR F ACILITY TO BE PROTECTED  \n7-42. The security force focuses all its actions on protecting the secured force or facility and providing \nmaximum early warning of threat activity. It operates between the main body and known or suspected \nenemy units. The security force moves as the main body moves and orients on its movement. The security \nforce commander has to know the main body’s scheme of maneuver and maneuver his force so it remains \nbetween the main body and the enemy. The value of terrain occupied by the security force depends on the \noperational area security it provides to the main body commander. \n7-43. In stability tasks, the security force should orient on the routes or areas where enemy activities \nfrequently occur. They could reemphasize on locations where IEDs or other explosive hazards have been \nrepeatedly used. Another example is the security force orienting surveillance on the offices occupied by a \nnewly seated foreign government whose legitimacy may be contested and targeted for violence by threat \nfactions. \nPERFORM CONTINUOUS RECONNAISSANCE  \n7-44. Security comes in large part from knowing as much as possible about the threat and terrain within the \nassigned AO. This detailed knowledge results from ongoing, focused reconnaissance that aggressively and \ncontinuously reconnoiters key terrain; seeks the location, composition, and disposition of the threat; and \nattempts to determine the threat’s COA early so that the SBCT Infantry rifle company can counter it. \nStationary security forces use combinations of OPs, patrols, and other information collection assets to \nperform continuous reconnaissance. Moving security forces accomplish this fundamental by performing \narea-, zone-, or route-reconnaissance in conjunction with temporary OPs and BPs. \n7-45. In stability tasks, units conduct continuous information collection with patrols, UAS, checkpoints, \nsensors, and urban OPs that keep a specific location under observation for extended periods. Snipers are an \norganic asset within the SBCT Infantry rifle company that can assist with covert observation of an urban \nOP. Reconnaissance may be linked to specific route security operations. \nMAINTAIN ENEMY CONTACT  \n7-46. Once gained, contact is not broken unless otherwise directed. The individual or sensor that first \nmakes contact does not have to maintain it. However, the security force, collectively, maintains contact. \nThe security force continuously conducts information collection on the threat’s activities, and prevents the \nthreat from surprising the main body or endangering adjacent friendly forces. \n7-47. The fundamentals of maintaining enemy contact require the following: \nContinuous contact (visual, electronic, sensor, or a combination).\nCapability to use direct and indirect fires.\nFreedom to maneuver.\nDepth (of observers in time and space).\nFORMS OF SECURITY \n7-48. Leaders categorize security operations in terms of the degree of security provided and the amount of \ncombat power required. (Refer to ADRP 3-90 for more information.) There are five primary forms of \nsecurity operations : \nScreen  is a security task that primarily provides early warning to the protected forces.\nGuard is a security task whose primary task is to protect the main body by fighting to gain time\nwhile also observing and reporting combat information and preventing enemy ground\nobservation of and direct fire against the main body. Units conducting a guard mission cannot\noperate independently because they rely upon fires and close combat forces assets of the main\nbody.\nCover  is a security task to protect the main body by fighting to gain time while also observing\nand reporting intelligence and preventing enemy ground observation of and direct fire against\nthe main body. Unlike a screening or guard force, the covering force is a self-contained force\ncapable of operating independently of the main body.\nChapter 7 \n7-12 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016Area security  is a security task conducted to protect friendly forces, installations, routes, and\nactions within a specific area.\nLocal security  is a security task that includes close in security activities conducted near a unit to\nprevent surprise by the enemy.\n7-49. The SBCT Infantry rifle company can conduct screen and guard independently without external \naugmentation. The company participates in covering force operations only as part of a larger element. It \ncan conduct area security missions on its own, but will usually participate as part of a SBCT Infantr y \nbattalion area security force such as an advance guard. The company always provides its own local \nsecurity. Local security includes observation posts, local security patrols, perimeter security, and other \nmeasures taken to provide close-in security. \n7-50. The screen, guard, and cover, respectively, contain increasing levels of combat power and provide \nincreasing levels of security for the main body. However, more combat power in the security force means \nless for the main body. Area security preserves the comman der’s freedom of move his reserves, position \nfire support means, provide for mission command, and conduct sustaining operations. Local security \nprovides immediate security for his forces. \nSCREEN \n7-51. A screen primarily provides early warning by observing, identifying, and reporting enemy actions. It \nprovides the least amount of security of any security mission. Generally, a screening force engages and \ndestroys enemy reconnaissance elements within its capabilities, but otherwise fights to not be decisively \nengaged or fixed. The SBCT Infantry rifle company can conduct a screen mission independently or as part \nof an SBCT Infantry battalion or brigade operation. It maximizes its use of Infantry conducting combat, \nreconnaissance and security patrols. The MGS in combination with the Infantry platoons and mortar section \nsupport should be used to conduct combat patrols, or assist with elements in contact to break contact. \nDepending on mission variables, the SBCT Infantry rifle company might require augmentation to conduct \nan effective screen mission. Acquiring Stryker reconnaissance vehicle (RV) equipped with Long Range \nAcquiring Scout Surveillance System (LRAS3) can increase the ability to identify enemy elements. \n7-52. A screen is appropriate to cover gaps between forces, the exposed flanks or rear of stationary and \nmoving forces, or the front of a stationary formation. Units use screens when the likelihood of enemy \ncontact is remote, the expected enemy force is small, or the friendly main body needs only a minimum \namount of time, once it is warned, to react effectively. A screening force primarily uses indirect fires or \nCAS to destroy enemy reconnaissance elements and slow the movement of other enemy forces. Units \nusually accomplish screening by establishing a series of OPs and conducting patrols to ensure adequate \nsurveillance of the assigned AO. \n7-53. Screen tasks are to — \nAllow no enemy ground element to pass through the screen undetected and unreported.\nMaintain continuous surveillance of all avenues of approach into the designated area under all\nvisibility conditions.\nDestroy or repel all enemy reconnaissance within its capabilities.\nLocate the lead elements of each enemy advance guard and determine its direction of movement\nin a defensive screen.\nMaintain contact with enemy forces and report any activity in the AO.\nMaintain contact with the main body and any security forces operating on its flanks.\nImpede and harass the enemy within its capabilities while displacing.\n7-54. Counterreconnaissance is an essential component of security operations. The security force should \ndeny the enemy information and intelligence concerning the friendly force. The security force \naccomplishes this by destroying, defeating, or deceiving enemy reconnaissance units or sensors according \nto engagement criteria and the ROE. \nEnabling Operations \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 7-13 GUARD \n7-55. A guard differs from a screen in that a guard force contains sufficient combat power to defeat, cause \nthe withdrawal of, or fix the lead elements of an enemy ground force before it can engage the main body \nwith direct fire. A guard force routinely engages enemy forces with direct and indirect fires while a \nscreening force primarily uses indirect fires or CAS to destroy enemy reconnaissance elements and slow \nthe movement of other enemy forces. A guard force uses all means at its disposal, to include decisive \nengagement, to prevent the enemy from penetrating to a position where it could observe and engage the \nmain body. It operates within the range of the main body’s fire support weapons, deploying over a narrower \nfront than a comparable-size screening force to permit concentrating combat power. The SBCT Infantry \nrifle company can conduct a guard mission independently.  \n7-56. The three types of guard operations are as follows : advance, flank, and rear guard. The commander \ncan assign a guard mission to protect either a stationary or a moving force. \nThe advance guard is responsible for clearing the axis of advance or designated portions of the\nAO of enemy elements. This allows the main body to move unimpeded, prevents the\nunnecessary delay of the main body, and defers the deployment of the main body for as long as\npossible. An advance guard for a stationary force is defensive in nature. The rifle company uses\nits Stryker infantry platoon to fix an enemy force while another force that can be tasked\norganized with Stryker Infantry or MGS maneuver out of contact to engage the enemy force. It\ndefends or delays according to the main body commander’s intent. An a dvance guard for a\nmoving Stryker force is offensive in nature and normally conducts a movement to contact and\ntries to initiate contact with dismounted elements.\nA flank guard protects against an exposed flank of the main body. The commander of the main\nbody designates the general location of the flank guard’s positions. AOs assigned to the flank\nguard should be sufficiently deep to provide early warning and reaction time. However, flank\nguards remain within supporting range of the main body. The Stryker Infantry rifle company\nconducts this by using alternating bounds with Infantry dismounting at key points along likely\nenemy avenues of approach.\nThe rear guard protects the exposed rear of the main body. This occurs during offensive tasks\nwhen the main body breaks contact with flanking forces or during a retrograde. The commander\nmay deploy a rear guard behind both moving and stationary main bodies. The rear guard for a\nmoving force displaces to successive BPs along PLs or delay lines in depth as the main body\nmoves. The nature of enemy contact determines the exact movement method or combination of\nmethods used in the displacement (successive bounds, alternate bounds, and continuous\nmarching).\n7-57. A unit conducting a guard performs certain tasks within its capabilities unless ordered otherwise. If a \nunit does not have the time or other resources to complete all of these tasks, it informs the commander \nassigning the mission of the shortfall and requests guidance on which tasks to complete or the priority of \ntasks. After starting the guard, if the unit determines that it cannot complete an assigned task, such as cause \ndeployment of the enemy advance guard, it reports this to the commander and awaits further instructions.  \nCOVER \n7-58. The SBCT Infantry rifle company is not structured to conducting a cover on its own. A covering \nforce  is a self-contained force capable of operating independently of the main body, unlike a screening or \nguard force to conduct the cover task ( FM 3-90 -1) . A covering force, or portions of it, often becomes \ndecisively engaged with enemy forces. Therefore, the covering force has to have substantial combat power \nto engage the enemy and accomplish its mission. A covering force develops the situation earlier than a \nscreen or a guard force. It fights longer and more often and defeats larger enemy forces. \n7-59. While a covering force provides more security than a screen or guard force, it requires more \nresources. A covering force accomplishes all the tasks of screening and guard forces. A covering force for a \nstationary force performs a defensive mission, while a covering force for a moving force generally \nconducts offensive actions. A covering force normally operates forward of the main body in the offense or \ndefense, or to the rear for a retrograde.  \nChapter 7 \n7-14 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  AREA SECURITY \n7-60. Area security operations may be offensive or defensive in nature. They focus on the protected force, \ninstallation, route, or area. Forces to protect range from echelon headquarters through artillery and echelon \nreserves to the sustaining base. Protected installations can be part of the sustaining base or they can \nconstitute part of the area’s infrastructure. Areas to secure range from specific points (bridges and defiles) \nand terrain features (ridge lines and hills) to large population centers and their adjacent areas. The SBCT \nInfantry rifle company can conduct an area security operation independently or as part of a SBCT Infantry \nbattalion operation.  \n7-61. Area security operations can require the execution of a wide variety of supporting operations and \ntasks. Depending on mission variables, a SBCT Infantry rifle company might require augmentation to \nconduct area security effectively.  \n7-62. When conducting an area security mission, the SBCT Infantry rifle company prevents threat ground \nreconnaissance elements from directly observing friendly activities within the area being secured. It \nprevents threat ground maneuver forces from penetrating the defensive perimeters established by the \ncommander. The commander may direct his subordinate platoons to employ a variety of techniques (such \nas OPs, BPs, ambushes, sniper employment and combat outposts) to accomplish this security mission. A \nreserve or QRF enables the commander to react to unforeseen contingencies. Using the assigned UAS and \nthe information collection assets available to the SBCT Infantry battalion, the SBCT Infantry rifle company \ncan execute security tasks through ambushes and preemptive strikes proactively and with greater precision. \n7-63. An analysis of mission variables enables the commander to determine the augmentation for the \nSBCT rifle company, with particular consideration given to the need for aviation, engineers, and artillery. \nEarly warning of threat activity is paramount when conducting area security missions, and provides the \ncommander with time and space to react to threats. Proper intelligence analysis and information collection \nplanning, coupled with dismounted/mounted patrols and aerial reconnaissance, is essential to successful \noperations, especially when securing fixed sites. Failure to conduct continuous reconnaissance can create a \nvulnerable seam through which the enemy can execute an infiltration or attack. \n7-64. During area security operations civilians will be present. Therefore, leaders ensure Soldiers \nunderstand current ROE. However, leaders are always responsible for protecting their forces and consider \nthis responsibility when applying the ROE. Restrictions on conducting operations and using force need to \nbe explained clearly and understood by everyone. Soldiers need to understand their actions, no matter how \nminor, may have far-reaching positive or negative effects. They need to realize both friendly or hostile \nmedia and adversary information activities can quickly exploit their actions, especially the manner in which \nthey treat the civilian population. \n7-65. When a perimeter is not feasible, the SBCT Infantry rifle company secures the area by establishing a \npresence and conducting operations throughout the area. The SBCT Infantry rifle company establishes \nperimeters around base camps, critical infrastructure, and high-value assets, while other units conduct \noperations to establish presence, provide security, and conduct stability tasks. The company can position a \nreaction force between several secured perimeters. Other missions or tasks in support of area security may \ninclude the following: \nScreens along zones of separation or other designated areas.\nRoute or convoy security of critical lines of communication.\nCheckpoints to monitor or control movement.\nBiometric data collection.\nDemonstrations to maintain an observable presence.\nLOCAL SECURITY \n7-66. Local security includes any local measure(s) taken by units to prevent surprise by the enemy. It \ninvolves avoiding detection by the enemy or deceiving the enemy about friendly positions and intentions. \nLocal security is an important part of maintaining the initiative. The requirement for maintaining local \nsecurity is an inherent part of all operations. Units use both active and passive measures to provide local \nsecurity. Active measures include OPs, patrols, and conducting stand-to. Passive measures include \nEnabling Operations \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 7-15 camouflage, noise and light discipline, and sensors to maintain surveillance over the area immediately \naround the unit. \n7-67. The SBCT Infantry rifle company is responsible for maintaining its own security at all times. Each \nStryker vehicle should have a dismounted element for local security. Stryker vehicles are vulnerable from \nattacks on its rear and sides from dismounts. Platoons and sections should establish mutually supporting \npositions for Stryker vehicles and their dismounted elements for 360 degree local security and to allow a \nsmaller local security force and a larger dismounted forward element. In addition to maintaining security \nfor its own elements, the SBCT Infantry rifle company may implement local security for other units as \ndirected by the SBCT Infantry battalion commander. Examples of such situations include, but are not \nlimited to, the following: \nProvide security for engineers as they emplace/clear obstacles or construct survivability\npositions in the SBCT Infantry rifle company BP.\nSecure an LZ.\nEstablish mounted or dismounted OPs to maintain surveillance of enemy infiltration and\nreconnaissance routes.\nConduct patrols to cover gaps in observation and to clear possible enemy OP from surrounding\nareas.\nHUMINT.\nNGOs.\nSupply and logistical operations.\nSECTION IV – PATROLS \n7-68. A patrol is a detachment sent out by a larger unit to conduct a combat, reconnaissance, or security \nmission. A patrol’s organization is temporary and specifically matched to the immediate tas k. Because a \npatrol is an organization, not a mission, it is not correct to speak of giving a unit a mission to “ Patrol .” \n(Refer to ATTP 3-21.9 for additional information about patrols.) \n7-69. A patrol can consist of a unit as small as a fire team. Squad- and platoon-size patrols are normal. If a \npatrol is made up of a single unit, such as a SBCT Infantry rifle squad sent out on a reconnaissance patrol, \nthe squad leader is responsible. If a patrol is made up of mixed elements from several units, then the senior \nofficer or NCO is designated as the patrol leader. This temporary title defines his role and responsibilities \nfor that mission. The patrol leader may designate an assistant, normally the next senior man in the patrol, \nand any subordinate element leaders he requires.  \n7-70. The planned action determines the type of patrol. The two types of patrols are combat and \nreconnaissance. Regardless of the type of patrol, the unit needs a clear task and purpose. The leader of any \npatrol, regardless of the type or the tactical task assigned, has an inherent responsibility to prepare and plan \nfor possible enemy contact while on the mission. Patrols are never administrative as they are always \nassigned a tactical mission. (Refer to FM 3-21.8 for more information.) \nCOMBAT PATROL  \n7-71. A combat patrol provides security and harasses, destroys, or captures enemy troops, equipment, or \ninstallations. When the commander gives a unit the mission to send out a combat patrol, he intends for the \npatrol to make contact with the enemy and engage in close combat. A combat patrol always tries to avoid \ndetection while moving, but discloses their location to the enemy in a sudden, violent attack. For this \nreason, the patrol normally carries a significant amount of weapons and ammunition. It may carry \nspecialized munitions. A combat patrol collects and reports any combat information gathered during the \nmission, whether related to the combat task or not. The three types of combat patrols are as follows:  \nRaid.\nAmbush.\nSecurity.\n7-72. Stryker Infantry conduct combat patrols tasked organized based on the mission variables of \nMETT-TC. They possess the capability to engage in close combat with Infantry and conduct sudden and \nChapter 7 \n7-16 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016violent attacks with significant firepower in combined arms with the use of crew served weapons from the \nMGS, ICV, MCV Stryker vehicles, or Infantry weapons squads. \nRECONNAISSANCE PATROL  \n7-73. A reconnaissance patrol collects combat information or confirms or disproves the accuracy of \nintelligence previously gained. The intent for this type of patrol is to avoid enemy contact and accomplish \nits tactical task without engaging in close combat. Reconnaissance patrols always try to accomplish their \nmission without being detected or observed. Because detection cannot always be avoided, a reconnaissance \npatrol carries the necessary arms and equipment to protect itself and break contact with the enemy. A \nreconnaissance patrol with as few personnel, arms, and equipment as only necessary. This increases stealth \nand cross-country mobility in close terrain. Regardless of how the patrol is armed and equipped, the leader \nalways plans for the worst case: contact. The three types of reconnaissance patrols Infantry units conduct \nare as follows:  \nRoute.\nArea.\nZone.\n7-74. The Stryker Infantry rifle c ompany task-organizes its reconnaissance patrols. It will always comprise \nitself of Infantry that deploy prior to points of suspected contact to ensure that it avoids enemy initiated \ncontact. \nSECTION V – RELIEF IN PLACE \n7-75. A RIP is an operation in which, by the direction of higher authority, all or part of a unit is replaced in \nan area by the incoming unit. The responsibilities of the replaced elements for the mission and the assigned \nAO are transferred to the incoming unit. The incoming unit continues the operations as ordered \n(FM 3-90-1). The commander conducts a RIP as part of a larger operation, primarily to maintain the \ncombat effectiveness of committed units. The higher headquarters directs when and where to conduct the \nrelief and establishes the appropriate control measures. Normally, the unit relieved is defending. However, \na relief may set the stage for resuming offensive tasks. A relief may serve to free the relieved unit for other \ntasks (such as decontamination, reconstitution, routine rest, resupply, maintenance, or specialized training). \nSometimes, as part of a larger operation, the commander wants the enemy force to discover the relief, \nbecause that discovery might cause it to do something in response that is prejudicial to its interest, such as \nmove reserves from an area where the friendly commander wants to conduct a penetration. \n7-76. There are three techniques for conducting a relief —sequentially, simultaneously, or staggered. A \nsequential relief occurs when each element within the relieved unit is relieved in succession, from right to \nleft or left to right, depending on how it is deployed. A simultaneous relief occurs when all elements are \nrelieved at the same time. A staggered relief occurs when the commander relieves each element in a \nsequence determined by the tactical situation, not its geographical orientation. Simultaneous relief takes the \nleast time to execute, but is more easily detected by the enemy. Sequential or staggered reliefs can take \nplace over a significant amount of time. These three relief techniques can occur regardless of the range of \nmilitary operations (ROMO) in which the unit is participating.  \n7-77. A relief can be characterized as either deliberate or hasty, depending on the amount of planning and \npreparations associated with the relief. The major differences are the depth and detail of planning and, \npotentially, the execution time. Detailed planning generally facilitates shorter execution time by \ndetermining exactly what the commander believes needs to be done and the resources needed to accomplish \nthe mission. Deliberate planning allows the commander and staff to identify, develop, and coordinate \nsolutions to most potential problems before they occur and to ensure the availability of resources when and \nwhere they are needed.  \nPLANNING \n7-78. Once ordered to conduct a RIP, the commander of the relieving unit contacts the commander of the \nunit to be relieved. The collocation of unit CPs helps achieve the level of coordination required. If the \nEnabling Operations \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 7-17 relieved unit’s forward elements can defend the AO, the relieving unit executes the RIP from the rear to the \nfront. This facilitates movement and terrain management.  \n7-79. When planning for a RIP, the SBCT Infantry rifle company commander takes the following actions: \nIssue an order immediately.\nSend an advance party composed of key leaders to conduct detailed reconnaissance and\ncoordination.\nAs the relieving unit, adopt the outgoing unit’s normal pattern of activity a s much as possible.\nAs the relieving unit, determine when the SBCT Infantry rifle company will assume\nresponsibility for the outgoing unit’s position.\nAs the relieving unit, colocate company headquarters with the relieved unit’s headquarters.\nMaximize operations security to prevent the enemy from detecting the relief operation.\nNote. Whenever possible, conduct the relief at night or under other limited visibility conditions. \nPlan for relief of sustainment elements after combat elements are relieved.\nAs the unit being relieved, plan for transfer of excess ammunition, wire, petroleum, oil, and\nlubricants, and other material of tactical value to the incoming unit.\nControl movement by reconnoitering, designating, and marking routes, and providing guides.\nCOORDINATION \n7-80. The incoming and outgoing commanders meet to exchange tactical intelligence, conduct a joint \nreconnaissance of the area, and complete other required coordination. The two commanders carefully \naddress passage of command and jointly develop contingency actions to deal with enemy contact during the \nrelief. This process usually includes coordination of the following information: \nLocation of vehicle and individual fighting positions (to include hide, alternate, and\nsupplementary positions). Leaders should verify fighting positions both by conventional map\nand on BFT/JCR (if equipped).\nThe enemy situation.\nThe outgoing unit’s tactical plan, to include graphics, SBCT Infantry rifle company and platoon\nfire plans, and individual vehicles’ sector sketches.\nFire support coordination, to include indirect fire plans and the time of relief for supporting\nartillery and mortar units.\nTypes of weapons systems being replaced.\nTime, sequence, and method of relief.\nLocation and disposition of obstacles, and the time when the commanders will transfer\nresponsibility.\nSupplies and equipment to be transferred.\nMovement control, route priority, and placement of guides.\nCommand and signal information.\nNote. Units conduct relief on the radio nets of the outgoing unit. \nMaintenance and logistical support for disabled vehicles.\nVisibility considerations.\nCapability gaps and recommendations to fill gaps if the Stryker Infantry rifle company is\nconducting relief with another non-Stryker organization.\nCONDUCTING THE RELIEF \n7-81. When conducting the relief, the outgoing commander retains responsibility for the AO and the \nmission. He exercises operational control over all subordinate elements of the incoming unit that have \nChapter 7 \n7-18 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016completed their portion of the relief. Responsibility passes to the incoming commander when all elements \nof the outgoing unit are relieved and adequate communications are established. \nSTAGGERED RELIEF  \n7-82. A staggered relief occurs when the commander relieves each element in a sequence determined by \nthe tactical situation, not its geographical orientation and usually in situations where the commander desires \nto conceal the relief from the enemy (FM 3-90-1). The staggered relief often follows the sequence of the \nsequential relie f. \nSEQUENTIAL RELIEF  \n7-83. Sequential relief is the most time-consuming relief method. The relieving unit moves to an assembly \narea to the rear of the unit to be relieved. Subordinate elements are relieved one at a time. This can occur in \nany order, with the relief following this general sequence: \nThe outgoing and incoming units colocate their headquarters and trains elements to facilitate\nmission command and transfer of equipment, ammunition, fuel, water, and medical supplies.\nThe first element being relieved (such as a platoon) moves to its alternate fighting positions or\nbattle positions while the relieving element moves into the outgoing element’s primary fighting\npositions. The incoming element occupies vehicle and individual fighting positions as\nappropriate.\nIncoming and outgoing elements complete the transfer of equipment and supplies.\nThe relieved element moves to the designated assembly area behind its position.\nOnce each outgoing element clears the rally point en route to its assembly area, the next\nrelieving element moves forward.\nSIMULTANEOUS RELIEF  \n7-84. Simultaneous relief is the fastest, but least secure, method. All outgoing elements are relieved at \nonce, with the incoming unit usually occupying positions, to include battle positions, and vehicle and \nindividual fighting positions. The relief takes place in this general sequence: \nOutgoing elements move to their alternate BPs or vehicle and individual positions.\nIncoming elements move along designated routes to the outgoing elements’ primary fighting\npositions.\nThe units complete the transfer of equipment and supplies.\nRelieved elements move to the designated unit assembly area.\nSECTION VI – PASSAGE OF LINES \n7-85. Passage of lines  is an operation in which a force moves forward or rearward through another unit’s \npositions with the intent of moving into or out of contact with the enemy. A passage may be designated as a \nforward or rearward passage of lines (JP 1-02). Units usually conduct passage of lines when at least one \nMETT-TC factor does not permit the bypass of a friendly unit. A passage of lines is a complex operation \nrequiring close supervision and detailed planning, coordination, and synchronization between the battalion \ncommanders of the unit conducting the passage and the unit being passed. The primary purpose of a \npassage of lines is to transfer responsibility (forward or rearward) for an area from one unit to another. \n7-86. A passage of lines occurs under two basic conditions. A forward passage of lines occurs when a unit \npasses through another unit’s positions while moving toward the enemy. A rearward passage of lines \noccurs when a unit passes through another unit’s positions while moving away from the enemy ( FM 3-90-\n1). \nPLANNING CONSIDERATIONS \n7-87. The controlling SBCT Infantry battalion is responsible for planning and coordinating a passage of \nlines involving the SBCT Infantry rifle company. In some situations, such as the SBCT Infantry rifle \nEnabling Operations \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 7-19 company using multiple passage routes (that is, a separate route for each platoon), the company commander \ntakes responsibility for planning and coordinating each phase of the operation. \n7-88. When planning a passage of lines, the commander considers the following tactical factors and \nprocedures: passage lanes, use of deception, battle handover, obstacles, air defense, sustainment \nresponsibilities, mission control, reconnaissance and coordination, forward passage of lines, and rearward \npassage of lines. \nFORWARD PASSAGE OF LINES \n7-89. In a forward passage, the passing unit first moves to an assembly area or an attack position behind \nthe stationary unit. Designated liaison personnel move forward to link up with guides and confirm \ncoordination information with the stationary unit. Guides then lead the passing elements through the \npassage lane. (See figure 7 -4.) \n7-90. The SBCT Infantry rifle company conducts a forward passage by employing tactical movement. It \nmoves quickly, using appropriate dispersal and formations whenever possible, and using its digital \ncommunication systems to make initial contact. It bypasses disabled vehicles, as needed. The company \nholds its fire until it passes the BHL or the designated fire control measure, unless the commander has \ncoordinated fire control with the stationary unit. Once clear of passage lane restrictions, the unit \nconsolidates at a rally point or attack position, and then conducts tactical movement according to its orders. \nChapter 7 \n7-20 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016\nLegend:  BHL = battle handover line, LD = line of departure, MGS = mobile gun system, PL = phase line, RP = \nrally point, SP = start point \nFigu re 7-4. SBCT Infantry rifle company forward passage of line \nREARWARD PASSAGE OF LINES \n7-91. Because of the increased chance of fratricide and friendly fire during a rearward passage, \ncoordination of recognition signals and direct fire restrictions is critical. (See figure 7-5 on page 7-21.) \nRehearsals and training can help reduce fratricide and friendly fire. The passing unit contacts the stationary \nunit while it is still beyond direct fire range and conducts coordination as discussed previously. Near \nrecognition signals and location of the BHL are emphasized. Both the passing unit and the stationary unit \ncan employ additional fire control measures, such as restrictive fire lines (RFL), to minimize the risk of \nfratricide and friendly fire. \nEnabling Operations \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 7-21 \nLegend:  CDR = commander, FIST = fire integration support team, RP = rally point, SP = start point, XO = \nexecutive officer \nFigure 7-5. SBCT Infantry rifle company rearward passage of lines \n7-92. Following coordination, the passing unit continues tactical movement toward the passage lane. The \npassing unit is responsible for its security until it passes the BHL. If the stationary unit provides guides, the \npassing unit can conduct a short halt to link up and coordinate with them. The passing unit moves quickly \nthrough the passage lane to a designated location behind the stationary unit. \n7-93. Stationary unit and passing unit responsibilities. (See table 7-1.) \nChapter 7 \n7-22 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  Table 7-1. Stationary and passing unit responsibilities \nStationary Unit  Passing Unit  \nClears lanes or reduces obstacles along routes . May assist with reducing obstacles  \nProvides obstacle and friendly units’ locations.  Provides order of movement and scheme of \nmaneuver.  \nClears and maintains routes up to the BHO line.  May assist with maintaining routes.  \nProvides traffic control for use  of routes and \nlanes.  Augments the traffic control capability of the \nstationary unit as required.  \nProvides  security for the passage up to the BHO \nline. Maintains protection measures.  \nIdentifies locations for the passing unit to use as \nassembly areas and attack positions.  Assumes full responsibility for its own \nsustainment support forward of the BHO line.  \nControls all fires in support of the passage.  Positions artillery to support the passage.  \nSECTION VII – LINKUP \n7-94. A linkup  is a meeting of friendly ground forces, which occurs in a variety of circumstances \n(FM 3-90-1). It happens when an advancing force reaches an objective area previously seized by another \nforce, when an encircled force breaks out to rejoin friendly forces, or when a force comes to the relief of an \nencircled force, and when converging maneuver forces meet. Both forces may be moving toward each \nother, or one may be stationary. Whenever possible, joining forces exchange as much information as \npossible before starting a mission.  \n7-95. The headquarters ordering the linkup establishes — \nA common operational picture.\nCommand relationship and responsibilities of each force before, during, and after linkup.\nCoordination of fire support before, during, and after linkup, to include control measures.\nLinkup method.\nRecognition signals and communication procedures to use, to include pyrotechnics, armbands,\nvehicle markings, weapon orientation, panels, colored smoke, lights, and challenge and\npasswords.\nActions to conduct following linkup.\nCONTROL MEASURES \n7-96. The commander who orders the linkup establishes control measures for units conducting the linkup. \nHe assigns each unit an AO defined by left and right boundaries and a restricted fire line. He establishes a \nno-fire area around one or both companies to ensure that uncleared air-delivered munitions or indirect fires \ndo not cross either the RFL or a boundary and impact friendly forces.  \n7-97. The restricted fire line assists with the prevention of fratricide. The linkup forces use the linkup \npoints established by the commander to make physical contact with each other. The commander designates \nalternate linkup points, since enemy action may interfere with the primary linkup points. Control measures \nare adjusted during the mission to provide for freedom of action and positive control. \nEXECUTION \n7-98. There are two linkup techniques. The preferred method is when the moving force has an assigned \nLOA near the other force and conducts the linkup at predetermined contact points. Units then coordinate \nfurther actions. \nEnabling Operations \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 7-23 7-99. The least preferred method of linkup a commander can use during highly mobile or fluid operations \nis when the enemy force escapes from a potential encirclement or when one of the linkup forces is at risk \nand requires immediate reinforcement. In this method, the moving force continues to move and conduct \nlong-range recognition via radio or other measures, stopping only when it makes physical contact with the \nother force. \nPHASES OF THE LINKUP \n7-100. The SBCT Infantry rifle company conducts linkup activities independently or as part of a larger \nforce. Within a larger unit, the company may lead the linkup force. The linkup consists of three phases. The \nfollowing actions are critical to the execution of a successful linkup. \nPHASE 1, FAR RECOGNITION SIGNAL  \n7-101. During this phase, the forces conducting a linkup establish both FM radio and digital \ncommunications before reaching direct fire range. The lead element of each linkup force should monitor \nthe radio frequency of the other friendly force and its digital communications for messages. \nPHASE 2, COORDINATION  \n7-102. Before initiating movement to the linkup point, the forces coordinate necessary tactical \ninformation/intelligence that includes the following: \nKnown enemy situation.\nBFT/JCR (if equipped) filter setting and address book commonality.\nType and number of friendly vehicles and number of vehicles equipped with BFT/JCR.\nDisposition of stationary forces (if either unit is stationary).\nRoutes to the linkup point and rally point (if any).\nDirect and indirect fire control measures.\nNear recognition signal(s).\nCommunications information.\nSustainment responsibilities and procedures.\nFinalized location of the linkup point and rally point(s) (if any).\nAny special coordination, such as those covering maneuver instructions or requests for medical\nsupport.\nPHASE 3, MOVEMENT TO THE LINKUP POINT AND LINKUP  \n7-103. All units or elements involved in the linkup enforce strict fire control measures to help prevent \nfratricide and friendly fire. Moving or converging forces must easily recognize linkup points and RFL. \nLinkup elements take the following actions: \nConduct far recognition using FM radio or BFT/JCR (if equipped).\nConduct short-range (near) recognition using the designated signal.\nComplete movement to the linkup point.\nEstablish local security at the linkup point.\nConduct additional coordination and linkup activities, as needed.\nSECTION VIII – BREACHING \n7-104. Breaching is a synchronized combined arms operation under the control of the maneuver \ncommander. Whenever possible, units should bypass obstacles, enabling it to maintain the momentum of \nthe operation. Commanders ensure that conducting the bypass provides a tactical advantage without \nexposing the unit to unnecessary danger. Breaching begins when friendly forces detect an obstacle. \nBreaching ends when friendly forces destroy the enemy on the far side of the obstacle, or when battle \nhandover has occurred between a unit conducting the breaching and follow-on forces. Successful obstacle \nbreaching depends on the SBCT Infantry rifle company effectively applying the breaching fundamentals of \nChapter 7 \n7-24 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016SOSRA. Deliberate, hasty (includes in-stride), and covert are the three general types of breaching \noperations. (Refer to ATP 3-34.22 for more information.)  \nBREACHING TENETS \n7-105. Successful breaching is characterized by applying breaching tenets. These tenets should be applied \nwhenever an obstacle is encountered in the AO, whether during an attack or a route clearance. The tenet s \nare— \nIntelligence.\nBreaching fundamentals.\nBreaching organization.\nMass.\nSynchronization.\nINTELLIGENCE  \n7-106. Success depends largely on the force commander’s ability to see the AO. He identif ies how the \nenemy is using the terrain to minimize the risk of surprise. This is particularly true when attempting to \ncounter the enemy’s use of obstacles. This is done with the IPB process. During the IPB process, the \nsituation template is developed. The situational template is a graphic al depiction of expected threat \ndispositions based on threat doctrine and the effects of the AO for a particular COA. (Refer to ATP 2-01.3 \nfor more information.) \nBREACHING FUNDAMENTALS  \n7-107. SOSRA are the breaching fundamentals that are applied to ensure success when breaching against \na defending enemy. These fundamentals always apply, but they may vary based on the mission variables. \n(See table 7-2 on page 7-26.)  \n7-108. Suppression is a tactical task used to employ direct or indirect fires or an electronic attack on \nenemy personnel, weapons, or equipment to prevent or degrade enemy fires and observation of friendly \nforces (ATP 3-34.22). The purpose of suppression during breaching is to protect forces reducing and \nmaneuvering through an obstacle. The MGS platoon is designed to provide majority of the direct fire \nsuppression tasks with it 105-mm main gun, M240 COAX, and .50 cal. The Stryker ICVs can assist with its \nRWS MK-19, .50 cal, or with their M240b machine gun. The Infantry provide suppression with their \nM240b machine guns from its weapon squad. The mortar section can provide suppression with dismounted \n60-mm and 120-mm mortars using HE rounds. \n7-109. Obscuration needs to be employed to protect forces conducting obstacle reduction and the passage \nof assault forces. Obscuration hampers enemy observation and target acquisition and conceals friendly \nactivities and movement. Obscuration smoke deployed on or near the enemy’s position minimizes its \nvision. Screening smoke employed between the reduction area and the enemy conceals movement and \nreduction activities. It also degrades enemy ground and aerial observations. Obscuration needs to be \nplanned carefully to provide maximum degradation of enemy observation and fires, but it must not \nsignificantly degrade friendly fires and control. Sources of Smoke for the SBCT Infantry rifle company can \ncome from artillery, mortars, smoke salvos on the Stryker vehicles and smoke grenades for dismounts. The \nmortar section can provide both suppression and obscuration during a breach if using both the Infantry \n60-mm and mounted 120-mm mortars with smoke, white phosphorus (WP) and high-explosive ( HE) \nrounds. \n7-110. Friendly forces secure the reduction area to prevent the enemy from interfering with obstacle \nreduction and the passage of the assault force through the lanes created during the reduction. Security needs \nto be effective against outposts and fighting positions near the obstacle and against overwatching units, as \nnecessary. The far side of the obstacle is secured by fires or be occupied before attempting any effort to \nreduce the obstacle. The attacking unit’s higher headquarters has the responsibility to isolate the breach \narea by fixing adjacent units, attacking enemy reserves in depth, and providing counter-fire support. \nIdentifying the extent of the enemy’s defenses is critical before selecting the appropriate technique to \nsecure the point of breach. If the enemy controls the point of breach and cannot be adequately suppressed, \nEnabling Operations \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 7-25 the force secures the point of breach before it can reduce the obstacle. The breach force is resourced with \nenough maneuver assets to provide local security against the forces that the support force cannot \nsufficiently engage. Elements within the breach force that secure the reduction area may be used to \nsuppress the enemy once reduction is complete. \n7-111. Reduction is the creation of lanes through or over an obstacle to allow an attacking force to pass. \nThe number and width of lanes created varies with the enemy situation, the assault force’s size a nd \ncomposition, and the scheme of maneuver. The lanes need to allow the assault force to rapidly pass through \nthe obstacle. The breach force will reduce, proof (if required), mark, and report lane locations and the lane-\nmarking method to higher headquarters. Follow-on units will further reduce or clear the obstacle when \nrequired. Reduction cannot be accomplished until effective suppression and obscuration are in place, the \nobstacle has been identified, and the point of breach is secure. \n7-112. A breaching is not complete until — \nFriendly forces have assaulted to destroy the enemy on the far side of the obstacle that is\ncapable of placing or observing direct and indirect fires on the reduction area.\nBattle handover with follow-on forces has occurred, unless no battle handover is planned.\nBREACHING ORGANIZATION  \n7-113. The commander organizes friendly forces to accomplish the breaching fundamentals quickly and \neffectively. This requires him to organize support, breach, and assault forces with the necessary assets to \naccomplish their roles.  \nSupport Force \n7-114. The support force’s primary responsibility is to eliminate the enemy’s ability to interfere with a \nbreach and is usually comprised of the MGS platoon, mortar section, and one Infantry squad or platoon. \nThe Infantry element uses its weapons squad to provide an intermediate support force for engagements \ncloser to the obstacle breach point. \nBreach Force \n7-115. The breach force assist in the passage of the assault force by creating, proofing (if necessary), and \nmarking lanes. This is usually comprised of an Infantry platoon, or platoons and engineer assets, if \navailable. The Sniper team or small element may assist by conducting a small scale covert breach on wire \nobstacles or engaging the obstacle overwatch element with long range precision fires. \nAssault Force \n7-116. The assault force’s primary mission is to destroy the enemy and seize terrain on the far side of the \nobstacle to prevent the enemy from placing direct fires on the created lanes. The Stryker vehicle is designed \nto provide protection to the point of deployment. It should not be used as a fighting vehicle to assault the \nobjective on the far side of the breach. The company commander should make the determination based on \nmission variable of METT-TC to risk possible destruction of a Stryker vehicle to achieve speed and some \nprotection for the assault force while moving through the breach to assault the objective. \nCONDUCTING THE BREACH \n7-117. Breaching entails the coordinated efforts of three task-organized elements: the support force, the \nbreach force, and the assault force. The discussion in this section covers the actions and responsibilities of \nthese elements role in the operation.  \nBREACHING ORGANIZATION  \n7-118. The commander in charge of the breach organizes forces to accomplish the five breaching \nfundamentals quickly and effectively.  \nChapter 7 \n7-26 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016Table 7-2. Relationship between breaching organization and \nbreaching fundamentals \nBreaching \nOrganization  Breaching Fundamentals  Responsibilities  \nSupport force  Suppress  \nObscure  Suppress enemy direct -fire systems \ncoveri ng the reduction area.  \nControl obscuring smoke.  \nPrevent enemy forces from repositioning or \ncounterattacking to place direct fires on the \nbreach force.  \nThe mortar section can provide both \nsuppression and obscuration with mix of \n60-mm and 120 -mm mortars \nsimultaneously.  \nBreach force  Suppress (provides \nadditional suppression)  \nObscure (provides \nadditional  obscuration in \nthe reduction  area)  \nSecure (provides local \nsecurity)  \nReduce  Create and mark the necessary lanes in an \nobstacle.  \nSecure the nearside and far side of an \nobstacle.  \nDefeat forces that can place immediate \ndirect fires on the reduction area.  \nReport the lane status/location.  \nAssault force  Assault  \nSuppress (if necessary)  Destroy the enemy on the far side of an \nobstacle that is capable of placi ng direct \nfires on the reduction area.  \nAssist the support force with suppression if \nthe enemy is not effectively suppressed.  \nBe prepared to breach follow -on or \nprotective obstacles after passing through \nthe reduction area.  \nSupport Force \n7-119. This element usually leads movement of the breach elements. After identifying the obstacle, it \nmoves to covered and concealed areas and establishes SBF positions. The support force leader sends a \nvoice or digital spot report (SPOTREP) to the commander. This report describes the location and \ncomplexity of the obstacle, the composition of enemy forces that are overwatching the obstacle, and the \nlocation of possible bypass. The commander decides whether to maneuver to a bypass or to breach the \nobstacle. \nNote. He needs to keep in mind that a bypass may lead to an enemy kill zone. \n7-120. In either case, the support force suppresses any enemy elements that are overwatching the obstacle \nto allow the breach force to breach or bypass the obstacle. The support force should be in position t o \nrequest suppressive artillery fires and smoke for obscuration. As the breach and assault forces execute their \nmissions, the support force lifts or shifts supporting fires. Because the enemy is likely to engage the support \nEnabling Operations \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 7-27 force with artillery, the support force needs to be prepared to move to alternate positions while maintaining \nsuppressive fires.  \nBreach Force \n7-121. The breach force receives a voice or digital SPOTREP identifying the location of the obstacle or \nbypass. It then organizes internally to meet these responsibilities —  \nProvide local security for the breach site as needed.\nConduct the actual breach. The breach force creates, proofs, and marks a lane through the\nobstacle or secures the bypass.\nMove through the lane to provide local security for the assault force on the far side of the\nobstacle. In some instances, the breach force may move to firing positions that allow it to\nsuppress enemy elements overwatching the obstacle. At other times, it may assault the enemy,\nwith suppressive fires provided by the support force.\nBreaching Methods \n7-122. The SBCT Infantry rifle company can create a lane by itself, if it is equipped with the assets and \nbreach the type of obstacle encountered. If the SBCT Infantry rifle company does not have this capability, \nit provides close-in security for attached engineers with breaching assets. Three breaching methods are — \nMechanical breaching, usually with mine plows or mine rakes.\nExplosive breaching, employing such means as the mine-clearing line charge (MICLIC),\nM173 line charge, the MK 7 Antipersonnel Obstacle Breaching System (APOBS), or\n1/4--pound blocks of TNT (2, 4, 6-Trinitrotoluene (CAS Number 118-96-7; explosive). The\nM\nGS can also use this method for walls, structures, and buildings. (See appendix A. )\nManual breaching, with Soldiers probing by hand or using such items as grappling hooks,\nshovels, picks, axes, and chain saws. This may include using logs, or other available items to\nconduct a breach of a wire obstacle. Manual breaching is the least preferred method.\n7-123. In extreme cases, the commander may order an obstacle to be forced through. This technique \nrequires the breach force to move in column formation through the obstacle location. If available, a \ndisabled vehicle can be pushed ahead of the lead breach vehicle in an attempt to detonate mines or overrun \nbarricades and wire obstacles .  \nCreating and Proofing the Lane \n7-124. The mine plow and other engineer assets are the preferred breaching devices, but if they are not \navailable the breach team may only have hand tools, picks, and shovels to create the lane. When properly \nequipped and supported, the platoon can create up to two lanes through an obstacle.  \n7-125. Proofing verifies that a lane is free of mines and that the width and trafficability of the point of \nbreach are suitable for the assault force. Proofing can be conducted visually (against surface-laid \nminefields), electronically (mine detectors), or mechanically (mine clearing rollers [MCRs]) this process \nensures that the lane is clear.  \nMarking the Lane \n7-126. After the lane is created and proofed, it can then be marked to ensure safe movement by vehicles \nand personnel; this is critical for follow-on forces that may not know the exact location of the cleared lane . \nDistinctive markers show where the lane begins and ends. A visible line down the center is effective. \nAnother technique is to mark both sides of the breached lane. \n7-127. To minimize the necessary breaching time, the proofing vehicle may simultaneously mark the lane. \nUnit SOPs will dictate marking methods and materials, which commonly include the following:  \nCleared lane mechanical marking system (CLAMMS).\nPathfinder system.\nEngineer stakes with tape.\nGuides.\nChapter 7 \n7-28 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016Chemical lights.\nExpended shell casings.\nCompleting the Breach \n7-128. Throughout the operation, the breach element provides continuous updates of the breach force’s \nprogress to higher headquarters and other elements involved in the breach. They coordinate with the \nsupport force for suppressive fires.  \n7-129. After marking is complete, the breach element uses voice and digital systems to report the location \nof the lane and the method of marking to expedite the movement of the assault force. Digital overlays \nenable units to move quickly to the breach lanes using the position navigation (POSNAV) or global \npositioning system (GPS). \n7-130. The assault force will often move behind the breach force and closely follow the breach vehicles \nthrough the new lane.  \nASSAULT FORCE \n7-131. While the breach is in progress, the assault force assists the support force or follows the breach \nforce while maintaining cover and dispersion. Once a lane is cleared through the obstacle, the assault force \nthen moves through the breach. It secures the far side of the obstacle by physical occupation or continues \nthe attack according to the commander’s intent.  \nATTACHMENTS  \n7-132. The types and quantities of these attachments depend on the mission and the number, size, and \ntype of organizations requiring support. These attachments and assets are used to breach and reduce \nobstacles. \nEngineer Squad \n7-133. The most versatile of all breaching assets, the engineer squad can conduct explosive or manual \nbreaches, proof and mark lanes through an obstacle, and provide guides during breaching. While it \nconducts breaching and proofing, the squad is vulnerable to enemy direct and indirect fires, and is secured \nby the higher, supporting, or requesting unit due to the engineer squad’s  limited capabilities. The engineer \nsquad will probably have limited capabilities. \nMINE-CLEARING LINE CHARGE  \n7-134. Used to breach wire and mine obstacles, the MICLIC can be either towed or mounted. This vehicle \nis known as the armored vehicle-launched MICLIC (AVLM). It clears a lane 100 meters deep and \n14 meters wide. \n7-135. The MICLIC is fired 62 meters from the obstacle to get the full 100 meters of depth. The charge \ncreates two skip zones, where the mines are not detonated, on the right and left side of the center line of the \ncleared lane. The skip zones, which are about 1.5 meters wide, necessitate the proofing of all MICLIC \nlanes. \n7-136. The MICLIC is effective against pressure-activated antitank mines and against mechanically \nactivated antipersonnel mines. Effectiveness is limited against magnetically activated mines, to include \nscatterable mines, and those with multi-impulse (doub le-impact) or time-delay fuse. The MICLIC is not \neffective on severely broken ground where the line charge cannot lay flat. When detonated, the MICLIC \nhas a danger area with a radius of 1600 meters. \nSECTION I X – GAP CROSSING \n7-137. Gap crossing is projecting combat power across a linear obstacle (wet or dry gap). It requires \nspecific procedures, detailed planning, and technical support that differ from other tactical operations. The \nSBCT Infantry rifle company can take part in two types of gap crossing operations: hasty and deliberate. \nThe company usually participates in a hasty or covert gap crossing as part of a SBCT Infantry battalion, \nEnabling Operations \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 7-29 and in deliberate gap-crossings as part of a brigade or larger element. The company can conduct a hasty or \ncovert gap crossing independently when supported by attached engineer assets. (Refer to ATTP 3-90.4 for \nmore information.) \n7-138. The commander may choose to conduct a hasty crossing when the momentum of the operation is \nmaintained, when the banks are lightly held or undefended, and when sufficient engineer assets are \navailable to support the crossing. Despite the use of the term “hasty,” the commander use s all available \ntime and assets to ensure that the conditions are set for the crossing. The crossing is similar to a breach in \nthat suppression and obscuration normally precede any attempt to cross the obstruction.  \nWET GAP CROSSING \n7-139. Hasty wet gap-crossings are decentralized operations to cross inland bodies of water (such as \ncanals, lakes, or rivers). These operations include crossing by tactical bridging, vehicle swimming or \nfording operations, or by Infantry if the objective area is close to the wet-gap crossing point. \n7-140. The SBCT Infantry battalion commander organizes his units into assault, support, and follow and \nsupport forces. The SBCT Infantry rifle company prepares to execute any of these missions as part of a \nSBCT Infantry battalion water crossing mission. \nASSAULT FORCE  \n7-141. The assault force conducts the initial assault across the body of water dismounted. Assault boats, \nair assault aircraft transport, or rope bridge are used by the assault force to cross the body of water. The \nassault force usually seizes immediate objectives on the far side to secure the crossing site for other \nelements. If it has the capability, the assault force then continues the advance from the exit bank to the final \nobjective. Infantry elements establish local security on the exit bank to permit development of the crossing \nsite. Engineers move with the assault force to breach obstacles and open or improve trail s. \nSUPPORT FORCE  \n7-142. The support force comprises engineer elements, Stryker vehicles, and mission command elements \nfrom the company headquarters. It develops the crossing site, emplaces the crossing means usually the \nRapid Emplaced Bridging System (REBS) organic to the engineer company (if applicable), and controls \nunits moving into and away from the crossing site. The controlling commander may position the support \nforce where it can assist the assault force in the direct assault on the crossing site. The engineers provide \nthe following types of support for crossing operations to: \nImprove mobility and reduce obstacles at the entrance and exit to the crossing site.\nImprove fording sites.\nEmplace assault boats, rafts, ferries, or bridges as the means of crossing the body of water.\nBridges used by supporting engineers include the REBS, armored vehicle launched bridge\n(AVLB), Wolverine, and ribbon or medium girder bridges. Engineers might repair a bridge so\nthat it can support the crossing operation.\nFOLLOW AND SUPPORT F ORCE  \n7-143. As the follow and support force, the SBCT Infantry rifle company’s primary mission is to provide \noperations security as the assault force moves to the far side of the water obstacle and seizes its immediate \nobjectives. The SBCT Infantry rifle company does this mainly by suppressing defending enemy elements \nwith both direct and indirect fires, and by firing or calling for smoke to screen the crossing site from enemy \nobservation. It prepares to take over the assault force’s mission.  \nDRY GAP-CROSSING OPERATIONS \n7-144. In most circumstances, hasty gap-crossing operations are limited to “dry” gaps (such as irrigation \nditches, railroad embankments, and antitank ditches). Operational considerations for a SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany hasty gap crossing are similar to those for a breach, with the SBCT Infantry rifle company task-\norganized into support, breach, and assault forces. The primary crossing means in the SBCT Infantry rifle \ncompany for hasty gap crossing is the REBS, which moves as part of the breach force. Without a vehicle \nlaunched bridge, the company employs a deployable universal combat earthmover (DEUCE) or high \nChapter 7 \n7-30 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016mobility engineer excavator (HMEE) to fill in or breach through the obstacle. Additionally, if the \nmechanical method is unavailable, the team may employ a field-expedient method (for example, \nexplosives) to facilitate the crossing. \nSECTION X – TROOP MOVEMENT \n7-145. Troop movement  is the movement of troops from one place to another by any available means \n(ADRP 3-90). The ability of a commander to posture friendly forces for a decisive or shaping operation \ndepends upon the commander’s ability to move that force. The essence of battlefield agility is the capability \nof conducting rapid and orderly movement to concentrate combat power at decisive points and times. \nSuccessful movement places troops and equipment at their destination at the proper time, ready for combat. \nThere are three types of troop movement: administrative movement, tactical road march, and approach \nmarch (Refer to FM 3-90-2 for more information). \nMETHODS OF MOVEMENT  \n7-146. Troop movements are made by dismounted and mounted marches using various combinations of \norganic combat and tactical vehicles, air, rail, and water means. The method employed depends upon the \nsituation, size and composition of the moving unit, distance the unit covers, urgency of execution, and the \ncondition of the troops. It depends on the availability, suitability, and capacity of the different means of \ntransportation. \nTACTICAL ROAD MARCH  \n7-147. A tactical road march  is a rapid movement used to relocate units within an area of operations to \nprepare for combat operations (ADRP 3-90). The primary consideration of the tactical road march is rapid \nmovement. However, the moving force employs security measures even when contact with enemy groun d \nforces is not expected. Stryker units conduct tactical road marches and approach marches. \n7-148. Units conducting road marches may or may not be organized into a combined arms formation. \nDuring a tactical road march, the commander is always prepared to take immediate action if the enemy \nattacks. Stryker vehicles with air guard positions should be placed between Stryker variants without them \nto provide better security during tactical road marches. \nORGANIZATION  \n7-149. The commander organizes a march column into four elements: reconnaissance, quartering/advance \nparty, main body, and trail party. These elements are further organized with considerations concerning \nvehicles that have similar rates of march, levels of fuel consumption, maintenance and recovery.  All \nelements of a march column use the same route for a single movement. The battalion may designate an \nalternate route for more than one column.  \n7-150. March column subordinate elements are a march serial and a march unit. A march serial is a major \nsubdivision of a march column that is organized under one commander who plans, regulates, and controls \nthe serial. An example is a battalion serial formed from a brigade-size march column. It moves and halts \nunder the control of a single commander who uses digital, FM, voice and visual signals. \nAPPROACH MARCH  \n7-151. An approach march  is the advance of a combat unit when direct contact with the enemy is \nintended (ADRP 3-90). A unit using an approach march moves in a task-organized tactical formation to its \ndestination. The approach march is used when the enemy’s approximate location is known, allowing the \nforce to move with greater speed and less physical security or dispersion. It is like the movement to contact, \nand may be used as a technique to conduct a movement to contact. The approach march terminates in a \nmarch objective, such as an attack position, assembly area, or assault position. It can be used to transition to \nan attack. An approach march employs security forces (advance, flank, and rear) based upon the threat \nsituation. \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 8-1 Chapter 8 \nDirect Fire Planning and Control \nSuppressing or destroying the enemy with direct fires is fundamental to success in \nclose combat. Direct fire is inherent in maneuver, as is close combat (ADRP 3-0). \nThe SBCT Infantry rifle company commander effectively plans to focus, distribute, \nand shift the overwhelming mass of his direct fire capability at critical locations and \ntimes to succeed in combat. Efficient and effective fire control means that the \ncompany acquires the enemy and masses the effects of direct fires to achieve decisive \nresults in the close fight. This chapter provides information about the principles of \ndirect fire control, the fire control process, and direct fire planning. \nSECTION I – FIRE CONTROL TECHNIQUES \n8-1. To successfully bring direct fires against an enemy force, commanders and leaders continuously \napply the steps of the fire control process. At the heart of this process are two critical actions: rapid, \naccurate target acquisition and the massing of fire to achieve decisive effects on the target. \n8-2. Target acquisition is the detection, identification, and location of a target in sufficient detail to permit \nthe effective employment of weapons. Massing of fires is defined by the terminal effect on the enemy, not \nby the number of systems or rounds fired. \n8-3. Massing entails focusing fires at critical points and then distributing the fires for optimum effect. \nFiring at multiple targets in depth prevents the enemy from dealing with any single threat and maneuvering \nfrom massing his fires against it. \nFIRE CONTROL PROCESS \n8-4. The following discussion examines target acquisition and massing of fires using these basic steps of \nthe fire control process: \nIdentify probable enemy locations and determine the enemy scheme of maneuver.\nDetermine where and how to mass fires.\nOrient forces to speed target acquisition.\nShift or redistribute fires.\nIDENTIFY PROBABLE ENEMY LOCATIONS AND DETERMINE THE ENEMY SCHEME OF \nMANEUVER  \n8-5. The commander and subordinate leaders plan and execute direct fires based on their estimate of the \nsituation. An essential part of this estimate is the analysis of the terrain and the enemy force, which aids the \ncommander in visualizing how the enemy will attack or defend a particular piece of terrain. (See \nfigure 8-1.) A defending enemy’s defensive positions or an attacking enemy’s support positions are \nnormally driven by intervisibility. Typically, there are limited points on a piece of terrain that provide both \ngood fields of fire and adequate cover for a defender. Similarly, an attacking enemy has only a limited \nselection of avenues of approach that provides adequate cover and concealment. \n8-6. Coupled with available intelligence, an understanding of the effects of a specific piece of terrain on \nmaneuver assists the commander in identifying probable enemy locations and likely avenues of approach \nboth before and during the fight. The commander may use any or all of the following products or \ntechniques in developing and updating the analysis: \nAn enemy situational template based on the analysis of terrain and enemy.\nChapter 8 \n8-2 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  A spot report or contact report on enemy locations and activities.\nReconnaissance of the AO.\nLegend:  MGS = mobile gun system \nFigure 8-1. Example of identifying probable enemy locations and determining \nenemy scheme of maneuver \nDETERMINE WHERE AND HOW TO MASS FIRES \n8-7. To achieve decisive effects, friendly forces need to mass their fires. Effective massing requires the \ncommander both to direct the fires of subordinate elements and to distribute the effects of the fires. Based \non his estimate of the situation and his concept of the operation, the commander identifies points where he \nwants to, or must, concentrate the unit’s fires ( see figure 8-2 on page 8-3). Most often, these are locations \nhe has identified as probable enemy positions or points along likely avenues of approach where the unit can \nmass direct fires. Because subordinate elements may not initially be oriented on the point where the \ncommander wants to mass fires, he may issue a fire command to the fires. At the same time, the \ncommander uses direct fire control measures and effectively distributes the fires of his elements, which are \nnow focused on the same point. \n8-8. To achieve the greatest mass effects the company commander balances the differences of the \nmaximum effective ranges of the crew served weapons on the ICVs, MGS, mortars, and Infantry. By \nplacing these weapon systems at equal distance from one another in firing position prevents a maximum \neffect of all weapon systems firing simultaneously. Therefore weapon systems with shorter maximum \neffective engagement ranges should be in positions forward of ones with longer maximum effective \nDirect Fire Planning and Control \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 8-3 engagement ranges. The company leadership should closely examine surface danger zones (SDZ) to ensure \nthat firing positions are within safe distance of the engagement area. \nFigure 8-2. Example of determining where and how to mass fires \nORIENT FORCES TO SPEED TARGET ACQUISITION  \n8-9. To effectively engage the enemy with direct fires, friendly forces need to acquire enemy elements \nrapidly and accurately. Orienting friendly forces on probable enemy locations and on likely avenues of \napproach will speed target acquisition (see figure 8 -3). Conversely, failure to orient subordinate elements \nresults in slower acquisition; this greatly increases the likelihood that enemy forces will be able to engage \nfirst. The clock direction orientation method, which is prescribed in most unit SOPs, is good for achieving \nall-around security; however, it does not ensure that friendly forces are most effectively oriented to detect \nthe enemy. To achieve this critical orientation, the commander typically designates TRPs on or near \nprobable enemy locations and avenues of approach. He orients his subordinate elements using directions of \nfire or sectors of fire. Normally, the gunners on crew-served weapons scan the designated direction, sector \nof fire, or area while other crewmen observe alternate sectors of fire or areas to provide all-around security. \nChapter 8 \n8-4 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016\nFigure 8-3. Example of orienting forces to speed target acquisition \nSHIFT AND REDISTRIBUTE F IRES \n8-10. As the engagement proceeds, leaders shift fires to direct and redistribute the effects based on their \nevolving estimate of the situation. SA becomes an essential part of the fire control process at this point. The \ncommander and subordinate leaders apply the same techniques and considerations, to include fire control \nmeasures that they used earlier to direct and distribute fires. A variety of situations dictate shifting of fires, \nto include the following: \nAppearance of an enemy force posing a greater threat than the one currently being engaged.\nExtensive attrition of the enemy force being engaged, creating the possibility of target overkill.\nAttrition of friendly elements that are engaging the enemy force.\nChange in the ammunition status of the friendly elements that are engaging the enemy force.\nManeuver of enemy or friendly forces resulting in terrain masking.\nIncreased fratricide and friendly fire risk as a maneuvering friendly element closes with the\nenemy force being engaged.\nPRINCIPLES OF DIRECT FIRE \n8-11. Effective fire control requires a unit to acquire the enemy and mass the effects of fires rapidly to \nachieve decisive results in a close fight. When planning and executing direct fires, the commander and \nsubordinate leaders need to know how to apply several fundamental principles. The purpose of the \nprinciples of direct fire is not to restrict the actions of subordinates. Applied correctly, they help the SBCT \nDirect Fire Planning and Control \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 8-5 Infantry rifle company to accomplish its primary goal in any direct fire engagement; that is, both to acquire \nfirst and shoot first. These principles give subordinates the freedom to act quickly upon acquisition of the \nenemy. This discussion focuses on the following principles: \nMass the effects of fire.\nDestroy the greatest threat first.\nAvoid target overkill.\nEmploy the best weapon for specific target.\nMinimize exposure.\nPlan and implement fratricide and friendly fire avoidance measures.\nPlan for limited visibility conditions.\nPlan for degraded capabilities.\nMASS THE EFFECTS OF FIRE \n8-12. The SBCT Infantry rifle company mass es its fires to achieve decisive results. Massing entails \nfocusing fires at critical points and distributing the effects. Random application of fires is unlikely to have a \ndecisive effect. For example, concentrating the SBCT Infantry rifle company’s  fires at a single target may \nensure its destruction or suppression; however, that fire control technique will probably not achieve a \ndecisive effect on the enemy formation or position. \nDESTROY THE GREATEST THREAT FIRST \n8-13. The order in which the SBCT Infantry rifle company engages enemy forces is in direct relation to the \ndanger the enemy presents. The threat posed by the enemy depends on his weapons, range, and positioning. \nPresented with multiple targets, a unit will, in most situations, initially concentrate fires to destroy the \ngreatest threat, and then distribute fires over the remainder of the enemy force. \nAVOID TARGET OVERKILL  \n8-14. The company uses only the amount of fire to achieve the necessary effect. Target overkill wastes \nammunition and diverts weapons that are better employed acquiring and engaging other targets. The idea of \nhaving every weapon engaging a different target is tempered by the requirement to destroy the greatest \nthreats first. \nEMPLOY THE BEST WEAPON FOR SPECIFIC TARGET  \n8-15. Using the appropriate weapon for the target increases the probability of rapid enemy destruction or \nsuppression; at the same time, it saves ammunition. The SBCT Infantry rifle company has many weapons \nwith which to engage the enemy. Target type, range, and exposure are key factors in determining the \nweapon and ammunition that should be employed, as are weapons and ammunition availability and desired \ntargets effects. Leaders should consider individual crew capabilities when deciding on the employment of \nweapons. The company commander arrays his forces based on the terrain, enemy, and desired effects of \nfires. As an example, when he expects an enemy dismounted assault in restricted terrain, the commander \nwould employ his Infantry squads, taking advantage of their ability to best engage numerous fast-moving \ntargets. \nMINIMIZE EXPOSURE  \n8-16. Units increase their survivability by exposing themselves to the enemy only to the extent necessary \nto engage him effectively. Natural or man-made defilade provides the best cover from lethal direct fir e \nmunitions. Infantry minimize their exposure by constantly seeking effective available cover, attempting to \nengage the enemy from the flank, remaining dispersed, firing from multiple positions, and limiting \nengagement times. \nPLAN AND IMPLEMENT FRATRICIDE AVOIDANCE MEASURES  \n8-17. The commander needs to be proactive in reducing the risk of fratricide and friendly fire, and \nnoncombatant casualties. He has numerous tools to assist him in this effort: identification training for \ncombat vehicles and aircraft, the unit ’s weapons safety posture, the weapons control status (WCS), \nChapter 8 \n8-6 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016recognition markings, and a COP to include range cards, sector sketches, and rehearsals. Knowledge and \nemployment of applicable ROE are the primary means of preventing noncombatant casualties.  \nNote.  Because it is difficult to distinguish between friendly and enemy Infantry Soldiers, the \ncommander constantly monitors the position of friendly Infantry squads. \nPLAN FOR LIMITED VISIBILITY CONDITIONS  \n8-18. At night, limited visibility fire control equipment enables the SBCT Infantry rifle company to engage \nenemy forces at nearly the same ranges that apply during the day. Obscurants such as dense fog, heavy \nsmoke, and blowing sand can reduce the capabilities of thermal and infrared (IR) equipment. The \ncommander should therefore develop contingency plans for such extreme limited visibility conditions. \nAlthough decreased acquisition capabilities have minimal effect on area fire, point target engagements will \nlikely occur at decreased ranges. Typically, firing positions, whether offensive or defensive, are adjusted \ncloser to the area or point where the commander intends to concentrate fires. Another alternative is the use \nof visual or IR illumination when there is insufficient ambient light for passive light intensification devices. \nNote.  Vehicles equipped with thermal sights can assist Infantry squads in detecting and engaging \nenemy Infantry forces in conditions such as heavy smoke and low illumination. \nPLAN FOR DEGRADED CAPABILITIES  \n8-19. Leaders initially develop plan s based on their units’ maximum capabilities; they make backup plans \nfor implementation in the event of casualties or weapon damage or failure. While leaders cannot anticipate \nor plan for every situation, they should develop plans for what they view as the most probable occurrences. \nBuilding redundancy into these plans, such as having two systems observe the same sector of fire, is an \ninvaluable asset when the situation (and the number of available systems) permits. Designating alternate \nsectors of fire provides a means of shifting fires if adjacent elements are knocked out of action. \nSECTION II – DIRECT FIRE PLANNING \n8-20. The SBCT Infantry company commander plans direct fires as part of the TLPs. The commander \nconsiders essential steps, such as where and how the company can and will mass fires, as he develops his \nconcept of the operations.  \nOVERVIEW \n8-21. Leaders plan direct fires and distribute and control their fire. Determining where and how the SBCT \nInfantry rifle company can mass fires is an essential step in this process. \n8-22. Based on where and how they want to direct and distribute fires, leaders can establish the weapons \nready postures for their elements and triggers for initiating fires. During mission preparation, leaders plan \nand conduct rehearsals of direct fires (and of the fire control process) based on the estimate of the situation. \n8-23. The commander plans direct fires in conjunction with development of his estimate of the situation \nand completion of the plan. Determining where and how the SBCT rifle company can and will mass fires \nare essential steps as the commander develops his concept of the operation. \n8-24. After identifying probable enemy locations, the commander determines points or areas where he can \nconcentrate combat power. His visualization of where and how the enemy will attack or defend assists him \nin determining the volume of fires he focus es at particular points to have a decisive effect. If he intends to \nmass the fires of more than one subordinate element, the commander establish es the means for distributing \nfires effectively. \n8-25. Based on where and how they want to concentrate and distribute fires, the commander and \nsubordinate leaders can then establish the weapons-ready postures for SBCT Infantry rifle company \nelements and triggers for initiating fires. The commander evaluates the risk of fratricide and friendly fire \nDirect Fire Planning and Control \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 8-7 and establishes controls to prevent it; these measures include the designation of recognition markings, \nWCS, and weapons safety posture. \n8-26. After determining where and how they will mass and distribute fires, the commander and subordinate \nleaders then orient elements so they can rapidly and accurately acquire the enemy. They can war-game the \nselected COA or concept of the operation to determine probable requirements for refocusing and \nredistributing fires and to establish other required controls. During mission preparation, the commander \nplans and conducts rehearsals of direct fires (and of the fire control process) based on his estimate of the \nsituation. \n8-27. The commander and his subordinate leaders continue to apply planning procedures and \nconsiderations throughout execution. They adjust direct fires based on a continuously updated estimate of \nthe situation, combining SA with the latest available intelligence. When necessary, they apply effective \ndirect fire SOPs, which are covered in the following discussion. \nSTANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES \n8-28. A well-rehearsed direct fire SOP ensures quick, predictable actions by all members of the SBCT \nInfantry rifle company. The commander bases the various elements of the SOP on the capabilities of his \nforce and on anticipated conditions and situations. SOP elements should include standard means for \nfocusing fires, distributing their effects, orienting forces, and preventing fratricide and friendly fire. The \ncommander should adjust the direct fire SOP whenever changes to anticipated and actual METT-TC factors \nbecome apparent. \n8-29. If the commander does not issue any other instructions, the SBCT Infantry rifle company begins the \nengagement using the SOP. The commander can subsequently use a fire command to direct or redistribute \nfires. The following paragraphs discuss specific SOP provisions for focusing fires, distributing fires, \norienting forces, and preventing fratricide and friendly fire. \nFOCUSING FIRES \n8-30. TRPs are a common means of focusing fires. One technique is to establish a standard respective \nposition for TRPs in relation to friendly elements and then to consistently number the TRPs, such as from \nleft to right. This allows leaders to quickly determine and communicate the location of the TRPs. \nDISTRIBUTING FIRES \n8-31. Two useful means of distributing the SBCT Infantry rifle company’s fires are engagement priorities \nand target array. One technique is to assign an engagement priority, by type of enemy vehicle or weapon, \nfor each type of friendly weapons system. The target array technique can assist in distribution by assigning \nspecific friendly elements to engage enemy elements of similar capabilities. \nORIENTING FORCES  \n8-32. A standard means of orienting friendly forces is to assign a primary direction of fire, using a TRP, to \norient each element on a probable enemy position or likely avenue of approach. To provide all-around \nsecurity, the SOP can supplement the primary direction of fire with sectors of fire using a friendly-based \nquadrant. The following example SOP elements illustrate the use of these techniques: \nThe center (front) platoon’s primary direction of fire is TRP 2 (center) until otherwise specified;\nthe platoon is responsible for the front two quadrants.\nThe left flank platoon’s pr imary direction of fire is TRP 1 (left) until otherwise specified; the\nplatoon is responsible for the left two friendly quadrants (overlapping with the center platoon).\nThe right flank platoon’s primary direction of fire is TRP 3 (right) until otherwise sp ecified; the\nplatoon is responsible for the right two friendly quadrants (overlapping with the center platoon).\nAVOIDING F RATRICIDE AND FRIENDLY FIRE \n8-33. A primary means of minimizing fratricide and friendly fire risk is to establish a standard WCS of \nWEAPONS TIGHT, which requires positive enemy identification before engagement. The SOP dictates \nways of identifying friendly rifle squads and other dismounted elements. Techniques include using arm \nChapter 8 \n8-8 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016bands, medical heat pads, or an IR light source or detonating a smoke grenade of a designated color at the \nappropriate time. Minimizing the risk of fratricide and friendly fire in the SBCT Infantry rifle company can \nbe accomplished through BFT/JCR (if equipped); however, this does not remove the SBCT Infantry rifle \ncomp any commander’s responsibility to plan for fratricide and friendly fire avoidance.  \n8-34. Finally, the SOP address es the most critical requirement of fratricide and friendly fire prevention —\nmaintaining SA. It directs subordinate leaders to inform the commander, adjacent elements, and \nsubordinates whenever a friendly force is moving or preparing to move. \nSECTION III – DIRECT FIRE CONTROL \n8-35. The small unit commander communicates to his subordinates the manner, method, and time to \ninitiate, shift, and mass fires, and when to disengage by using direct fire control measures. The commander \nshould control his unit’s fires so he can direct the engagement of enemy systems to gain the greatest effect. \nThe commander uses IPB and reconnaissance to determine the most advantageous way to use direct fire \ncontrol measures to mass the effects on the enemy and reduce fratricide and friendly fire from direct fire \nsystems. (Refer to ATP 2-01.3 for more information.) \nFIRE CONTROL MEASURES \n8-36. Fire control measures are the means by which the commander or subordinate leaders control fires. \nApplication of these concepts, procedures, and techniques assists the unit in acquiring the enemy, focusing \nfires on him, distributing the effects of the fires, and preventing fratricide and friendly fire. At the same \ntime, no single measure is sufficient to effectively control fires. At the SBCT Infantry rifle company level, \nfire control measures are effective only if the entire unit has a common understanding of what they mean \nand how to employ them. The following focuses on the various fire control measures employed by the \nSBCT Infantry rifle company. Table 8-1 lists the control measures; it is organized by whether they are \nterrain-based or threat-based. (Refer to FM 3-90-1 for more information.) \nTable 8-1. Common fire control measures \nTERRAIN -BASED FIRE CONTROL MEASURES  THREAT -BASED FIRE CONTROL MEASURES  \nTarget reference point (TRP)  Rules of engagement (ROE)  \nEngagement area (EA)  Weapons ready posture  \nSector of fire  Weapons safety posture  \nDirection of fire  Weapons control status (WCS)  \nTerrain -based quadrant  Engagement priorities  \nFriendly -based quadrant  Trigger  \nMaximum engagement line (MEL); Restrictive \nfire line (RFL); Final protective line (FPL)  Engagement techniques; Fire patterns;  \nTarget array  \nTERRAIN -BASED FIRE CONTROL MEASURES  \n8-37. The SBCT Infantry rifle company commander uses terrain-based fire control measures to direct and \ncontrol fires on a particular point, line, or area rather than on a specific enemy element. The following \nparagraphs describe the TTPs associated with this type of control measure. \nTarget Reference Point \n8-38. A TRP is a recognizable point on the ground that leaders use to orient friendly forces, and to \nconcentrate and control direct fires. When leaders designate TRPs as indirect fire targets, they can use the \nTRPs when calling for and adjusting indirect fires. Leaders designate TRPs at probable enemy locations \nand along likely avenues of approach. These points can be natural or man-made. A TRP can be an \nestablished site (such as a hill or a building), or an impromptu feature designated as a TRP on the spot \n(such as a burning enemy vehicle or smoke generated by an artillery round). Friendly units can construct \nmarkers to serve as TRPs (see figure 8-4 on page 8-9). Ideally, TRPs should be visible in three observation \nDirect Fire Planning and Control \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 8-9 modes (unaided, passive-IR, and thermal) so that all forces can see them. Examples of TRPs include the \nfollowing features and objects: \nProminent hill mass.\nDistinctive building.\nObservable enemy position.\nDestroyed vehicle.\nGround-burst illumination.\nSmoke round for immediate engagements only; this is the least preferred method.\nLegend:  TRP = target reference point \nFigure 8-4. Examples of constructed TRP markers \nChapter 8 \n8-10 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  Engagement Area \n8-39. This fire control measure is an area along an enemy avenue of approach where the commander \nintends to mass the fires of available weapons to destroy an enemy force. The size and shape of the EA are \ndetermined by the degree of relatively unobstructed intervisibility available to the unit’s weapons systems \nin their firing positions and by the maximum range of those weapons. Typically, commanders delineate \nresponsibility within the EA by assigning each platoon a sector of fire or direction of fire. \nSector of Fire \n8-40. A sector of fire is a defined area that must be covered by direct fire. Leaders assign sectors of fire to \nsubordinate elements, crew-served weapons, and individual Soldiers to ensure coverage of an area of \nresponsibility. They may limit the sector of fire of an element or weapon to prevent accidental engagement \nof an adjacent unit. In assigning sectors of fire, commanders and subordinate leaders consider the number \nand types of weapons available. They consider acquisition system type and field of view in determining the \nwidth of a sector of fire. For example, while unaided vision has a wide field of view, its ability to detect \nand identify targets at range and in limited visibility conditions is restricted. Conversely, most fire control \nacquisitions systems have greater detection and identification ranges than the unaided eye, but their field of \nview is narrow. The means of designating sectors of fire include the following: \nTarget reference points.\nClock direction.\nTerrain-based quadrants.\nFriendly-based quadrants.\nAzimuth or cardinal direction.\nDirection of Fire \n8-41. A direction of fire is an orientation or point used to assign responsibility for a particular location in \nthe AO that needs to be covered by direct fire. Leaders designate directions of fire for the purpose of \nacquisition or engagement by subordinate elements, crew-served weapons, or individual Soldiers. Direction \nof fire is most commonly employed when assigning sectors of fire would be difficult or impossible because \nof limited time or insufficient reference points. Means of designating a direction of fire include the \nfollowing: \nClosest TRP.\nClock direction.\nAzimuth or cardinal direction.\nTracer on target.\nInfrared laser pointer.\nQUADRANTS  \n8-42. Quadrants are subdivisions of an area created by superimposing an imaginary pair of perpendicular \naxes over the terrain to create four separate areas of fire. Quadrants can be based on the terrain, on friendly \nforces, or on the enemy formation.  \nNote.  The technique in which quadrants are based on the enemy formation is usually referred to \nas the target array; it is covered in the discussion of threat-based fire control measures. \n8-43. The method of quadrant numbering is established in the unit SOP. However, take care to avoid \nconfusion when quadrants based on terrain, friendly forces, and the enemy formations are used \nsimultaneously. \nTerrain-Based Quadrant \n8-44. A terrain-based quadrant entails use of a constructed TRP to designate the center point of the axes \nthat divide the area into four quadrants. This technique can be employed in both offensive and defensive \ntasks. In the offense, the commander designates the center of the quadrant using a feature or by creating a \nreference point (for example, using a ground-burst illumination round, a smoke-marking round, or a fire \nDirect Fire Planning and Control \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 8-11 ignited by incendiary or tracer rounds). The axes delineating the quadrants run parallel and perpendicular to \nthe direction of movement. In the defense, the commander designates the center of the quadrant using a \nconstructed TRP. \n8-45. In the examples shown in figure 8-5, quadrants are marked using the letter “Q” and a number (Q1 to \nQ4); quadrant numbers are in the same relative positions as on military map sheets (from Q1 as the upper \nleft-hand quadrant clockwise to Q4 as the lower left-hand quadrant). \nLegend:  EA = engagement area, MGS = mobile gun system, Q = quadrant, TRP = target reference point \nFigure 8-5. Examples of terrain-based quadrants \nFriendly-Based Quadrant \n8-46. The friendly-based quadrant technique entails superimposing quadrants over the unit’s formation. \nThe center point is based on the center of the formation, and the axes run parallel and perpendicular to the \ngeneral direction of travel. For rapid orientation, the friendly quadrant technique may be better than the \nclock direction method. This is because the target may look different as seen from different locations. \nFigure 8-6 illustrates use of friendly-based quadrants. \nChapter 8 \n8-12 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016\nFigure 8-6. Example of friendly-based quadrants \nMAXIMUM ENGAGEMENT LINE \n8-47. A MEL is the linear depiction of the farthest limit of effective fire for a weapon or unit. This line is \ndeterm ined by either the weapon’s or unit’s maximum effective range and by the effects of terrain. (For \nexample, slope, vegetation, structures, and other features provide cover and concealment that may prevent \nthe weapon from engaging to the maximum effective range.) An MEL serves several purposes. The \ncommander can use it to prevent crews from engaging beyond the maximum effective range, to define \ncriteria for the establishment of triggers, and to delineate the maximum extent of area of operations on the \nsector sketch. \nRESTRICTIVE FIRE LINE \n8-48. A RFL is a linear fire control measure beyond which engagement is prohibited without coordination. \nIn the offense, the commander can designate an RFL to prevent a base of fire element from firing into the \narea where an assaulting element is maneuvering. This technique is particularly important when armored \nvehicles support the maneuver of Infantry squads. In the defense, the commander may establish an RFL to \nprevent the unit from engaging a friendly rifle squad positioned in restricted terrain on the flank of an \navenue of approach. \nFINAL PROTECTIVE LINE \n8-49. The final protective line (FPL) is a line of fire established where an enemy assault is to be checked \nby the interlocking fires of all available weapons. The unit reinforces this line with protective obstacles and \nwith FPF whenever possible. Initiation of the FPF is the signal for elements, crews, and individual Soldiers \nto shift fires to their assigned portion of the FPL. They spare no ammunition in repelling the enemy assault, \na particular concern for machine guns and other automatic weapons. \nDirect Fire Planning and Control \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 8-13 THREAT -BASED FIRE CONTROL MEASURES  \n8-50. The SBCT Infantry rifle company commander uses threat-based fire control measures to concentrate \nand control fires by directing the unit to engage a specific enemy element rather than to fire on a point or \narea. The following paragraphs describe the TTP associated with this type of control measure. \nRULES OF ENGAGEMENT  \n8-51. ROE specify the circumstances and limitations under which forces may engage. They include \ndefinitions of combatant and noncombatant elements and prescribe the treatment of noncombatants. Factors \ninfluencing ROE are national command policy, the mission and commander’s intent, the OE, and the law of \nwar. ROE always recognize a Soldier’s right of s elf-defense; at the same time, they clearly define \ncircumstances in which he may fire. \n8-52. For an example of company level ROE, during a cordon and search mission, the command may \nestablish a WCS of WEAPONS TIGHT for the main gun. The commander could do this because higher \ncommand directives explicitly restrict the use of the main gun as an explosive breach technique. \nWEAPONS -READY POSTURE  \n8-53. Weapons-ready posture is the selected ammunition and indexed range for vehicle, individual, and \ncrew-served weapons. It is a means by which leaders use their estimate of the situation to specify the \nammunition and range for the most probable anticipated engagement. Ammunition selection depends on \nthe target type, but the leader may adjust it based on engagement priorities, desired effects, and effective \nrange. Range selection depends on the anticipated engagement range; it is affected by terrain intervisibility, \nweather, and light conditions. Within the SBCT Infantry rifle company, weapons-ready posture affects the \ntypes and quantities of ammunition loaded in ready boxes, stowed in ready racks, and carried by rifle \nsquads. The following considerations apply: \nExamples of weapons-ready posture –\nAn M203 grenadier, who se most likely engagement, is to cover dead space at 200 meters\nfrom his position, might load high-explosive dual-purpose (HEDP) ammunition, and set\n200 meters on his quadrant sight.\nA Soldier might dismount with an AT-4 instead of a Javelin to prepare for an engagement\nin a wooded area where engagement ranges are extremely short.\nAn MGS vehicle might battle carry high-explosive plastic (HEP) round if operating in an\nurban environment.\nWEAPONS -SAFETY POSTURE  \n8-54. Weapons-safety posture is an ammunition handling instruction that enables the commander to control \nthe safety of his unit’s weapons precisely. Leaders’ supervision of the weapons -safety posture, and \nSoldiers’ adherence to it, minimizes the risk of accidental discharge and fratricide and friendly fire. \nTable 8-2 outlines procedures and considerations for the SBCT Infantry rifle company when using the four \nweapons safety postures, listed in ascending order of restrictiveness: \nAMMUNITION LOADED.\nAMMUNITION LOCKED.\nAMMUNITION PREPARED.\nWEAPONS CLEARED.\n8-55. When setting and adjusting the weapons-safety posture, the commander weighs the desire to prevent \naccidental discharges against the requirement for immediate action based on the enemy threat. If the threat \nof direct contact is high, for example, the commander could establish the weapons safety posture as \nAMMUNITION LOADED. If the requirement for action is less immediate, he might lower the posture to \nAMMUNITION LOCKED or AMMUNITION PREPARED. The commander can designate different \nweapons safety postures for different elements of the unit. \nChapter 8 \n8-14 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  Table 8-2. Weapons safety posture levels \nWEAPONS SAFETY \nPOSTURE  VEHICLE  INFANTRY SQUAD WEAPONS AND \nAMMUNITION  \nAMMUNITION \nLOADED  50. cal machine gun\nammunition on feed \ntray.

The three levels of WCS outline the conditions, based on target identification criteria, under which \nfriendly elements can engage. The commander sets and adjusts the WCS based on friendly and enemy \ndisposition, and the clarity of the situation. In general, the higher the probability of fratricide and friendly \nfire, the more restrictive the WCS. The three levels, in descending order of restrictiveness, are as follows: \nWEAPONS HOLD. Engage only if engaged or ordered to engage.\nWEAPONS TIGHT. Engage only targets that are positively identified as enemy.\nWEAPONS FREE. Engage any targets that are not positively identified as friendly.\n8-57. As an example, the commander may establish the weapons control status as WEAPONS HOLD \nwhen friendly forces are conducting a passage of lines. By maintaining situational understanding of his \nown elements and adjacent friendly forces, however, he may lower the WCS. In such a case, the \ncommander may set a WEAPONS FREE status when he knows there are no friendly elements near the \nengagement. This permits his elements to engage targets at extended ranges even though it is difficult to \ndistinguish targets accurately at ranges beyond 2000 meters under combat conditions. Another \nconsideration is that the WCS is extremely important for forces using combat identification systems. \nEstablishing the WCS as WEAPONS FREE permits leaders to engage an unknown target when they fail to \nget a friendly response. \nENGAGEMENT PRIORITIES  \n8-58. Engagement priorities provide platoon and company level direct/indirect fire distribution examples \nthat combine engagement priorities (targeting by composition) and fire patterns/target arrays (targeting by \ndisposition). This can serve one or more of the following critical fire control functions: \n8-59. Prioritize HPTs. In concert with his concept of the operation, the commander determines which \ntarget types provide the greatest payoff. He can then set these as a unit engagement priority. (For example, \nhe may decide that destroying enemy engineer assets is the best way to prevent the enemy from breaching \nan obstacle.) \n8-60. Employ the best weapons for the target. Establishing engagement priorities for specific friendly \nsystems increases the effectiveness with which the unit employs its weapons. As an example, the \nengagement priority for the Javelin could be enemy tanks first, then enemy personnel carriers. This would \ndecrease the chance that the company’s lighter systems will engage enemy armored vehicles.  \nDirect Fire Planning and Control \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 8-15 8-61. Distribute the unit’s fires. Establishing different priorities for similar friendly systems helps to \nprevent overkill and achieve effective distribution of fires. (For example, the commander may designate the \nenemy’s tanks as the initial priority for the MGS platoon, while making the enemy’s personnel carriers the \npriority for another platoon.) This would decrease the chances of units engaging against two enemy tanks, \nwhile ignoring the dangers posed by the personnel carriers. \nTRIGGER  \n8-62. A trigger is a specific set of conditions that dictates initiation of fires. Often referred to as \nengagement criteria, a trigger specifies the circumstances in which subordinate elements should engage . \nThe circumstances can be based on a friendly or enemy event. (For example, the trigger for a friendly \nplatoon to initiate engagement could be three or more enemy combat vehicles passing or crossing a given \npoint or line.) This line can be any natural or man-made linear feature (such as a road, ridge line, or \nstream) . It may be a line perpendicular to the unit’s orientation, delineated by one or more reference points.  \nENGAGEMENT TECHNIQUES  \n8-63. Engagement techniques are effects-oriented fire distribution measures. The following engagement \ntechniques, the most common in SBCT Infantry rifle company operations, are covered in this discussion: \nPoint fire.\nArea fire.\nSimultaneous.\nAlternating fire.\nObserved fire.\nSequential fire.\nTime of suppression.\nReconnaissance by fire.\nPoint Fire \n8-64. Point fire entails concentrating the effects of a unit’s fire against a specific, identified target such as a \nvehicle, machine gun bunker, or ATGM position. When leaders direct point fire, all of the unit’s weapons \nengage the target, firing until it is destroyed or the required time of suppression has expired. Employing \nconverging fires from dispersed positions makes point fire more effective because the target is engaged \nfrom multiple directions. The unit may initiate an engagement using point fire against the most dangerous \nthreat, and then revert to area fire against other, less threatening point targets. \nNote. Use of point fire is fairly rare because a unit seldom encounters a single, clearly identified \nenemy weapon. \nArea Fire \n8-65. Area fir e involves distributing the effects of a unit’s fire over an area in which enemy positions are \nnumerous or are not obvious. If the area is large, leaders assign sectors of fire to subordinate elements using \na terrain-based distribution method such as the quadrant technique. Typically, the primary purpose of the \narea fire is suppression; however, sustaining effective suppression requires judicious control of the rate of \nfire. \nSimultaneous Fire \n8-66. Units employ simultaneous fire to rapidly mass the effects of their fires or to gain fire superiority. \n(For example, a unit may initiate an SBF with simultaneous fire, and then revert to alternating or sequential \nfire to maintain suppression.) Simultaneous fire is employed to negate the low probability of the hit and kill \nof certain antiarmor weapons. As an example, a rifle squad may employ simultaneous fire with its Javelins \nto ensure rapid destruction of an enemy armored fighting vehicle that is engaging a friendly position. \nChapter 8 \n8-16 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016Alternating Fire \n8-67. In alternating fire, pairs of elements continuously engage the same point or area target one at a time. \n(For example, a SBCT Infantry rifle company may alternate fires of two platoons, an infantry platoon may \nalternate the fires of its squads, or an Infantry platoon may alternate the fires of a pair of machine guns.) \nAlternating fire permits the unit to maintain suppression for a longer duration than does volley fire; it also \nforces the enemy to acquire and engage alternating points of fire. \nObserved Fire \n8-68. Observed fire is usually used when the SBCT Infantry rifle company is in protected defensive \npositions with engagement ranges in excess of 2500 meters. It can be employed between elements of the \ncompany (such as the Infantry platoon lasing and observing while the machine gun section fires) or \nbetween machine guns in the section of a platoon. The commander or platoon leader directs one element or \nsection to engage. The remaining elements or sections observe fires and prepare to engage on order in case \nthe engaging element consistently misses its targets, experiences a malfunction, or runs low on \nammunition. Observed fire allows for mutual observation and assistance while protecting the location of \nthe observing elements. \nSequential Fire \n8-69. Sequential fire entails the subordinate elements of a unit engaging the same point or area target one \nafter another in an arranged sequence. Sequential fire can help to prevent the waste of ammunition, as when \nan Infantry rifle platoon waits to see the effects of the first Javelin before firing another. Sequential fire \npermits elements that have already fired to pass on intelligence they have learned from the engagement. An \nexample would be an Infantryman who missed an enemy armored fighting vehicle with Javelin fires, \npassing range and lead information to the next Soldier preparing to engage the enemy armored fighting \nvehicle.  \nTime of Suppression \n8-70. Time of suppression is the period, specified by the commander, during which an enemy position or \nforce must be suppressed. Suppression time is typically dependent on the time it will take a supported \nelement to maneuver. Usually, a unit suppresses an enemy position using the sustained rate of fire of its \nautomatic weapons. In planning for sustained suppression, leaders needs to consider several factors: the \nestimated time of suppression, the size of the area being suppressed, the type of enemy force to be \nsuppressed, range to the target, rates of fire, and available ammunition quantities. \nReconnaissance by Fire \n8-71. Reconnaissance by fire is the process of engaging possible enemy locations to elicit a tactical \nresponse (such as return fire or movement). This response permits the commander and subordinate leaders \nto acquire the target and then to mass fires against the enemy element. Typically, the commander directs a \nsubordinate element to conduct the reconnaissance by fire. (For example, he may direct an overwatching \nplatoon to conduct the reconnaissance by fire against a probable enemy position before initiating movement \nby a bounding element.) \nFIRE PATTERNS  \n8-72. Fire patterns are a threat-based measure designed to distribute the fires of a unit simultaneously \nbetween multiple, similar targets. Platoons use those most often to distribute fires across an enemy \nformation. Leaders designate and adjust fire patterns based on terrain and the anticipated enemy formation. \nThe basic fire patterns, illustrated in figure 8-7 on page 8-17, are — \nFrontal.\nCross.\nDepth.\nFrontal Fire \n8-73. Leaders may initiate frontal fire when targets are arrayed in front of the unit in a lateral \nconfiguration. Weapons systems engage targets to their respective fronts. (For example, the left flank \nDirect Fire Planning and Control \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 8-17 weapon engages the left-most target; the right flank weapon engages the right-most target.) As weapons \nsystems destroy targets, weapons shift fires toward the center of the enemy formation from near too far. \nCross Fire \n8-74. Leaders initiate cross fire when targets are arrayed laterally across the unit’s front in a manner that \npermits diagonal fires at the enemy’s flank, or when obstructions prevent unit weapons from firing \nfrontally. Right flank weapons engage the left-most targets; left flank weapons engage the right-most \ntargets. Firing diagonally across an engagement area provides more flank shots, thus increasing the chance \nof kills. It reduces the possibility of the enemy detecting friendly elements should the enemy continue to \nmove forward. As friendly elements destroy targets, weapons shift fires toward the center of the enemy \nformation. \nDepth Fire \n8-75. Leaders initiate depth fire when enemy targets disperse in depth, perpendicular to the unit. Center \nweapons engage the closest targets; flank weapons engage deeper targets. As the unit destroys targets, \nweapons shift fires toward the center of the enemy formation. \nFigure 8-7. Examples of fire patterns \nTarget Array \n8-76. Target array enables the commander to distribute fires when the enemy force is concentrated and \nterrain-based controls are inadequate. Forces create this threat-based distribution measure by \nsuperimposing a quadrant pattern on the enemy formation. Soldiers center the pattern on the enemy \nformation, with the axes running parallel and perpendicular to the enemy’s direction of travel. The target \narray fire control measure is effective against an enemy with a well-structured organization and \nstandardized doctrine. However, it may prove less effective against an enemy that presents few organized \nformations, or does not follow strict prescribed tactics. Leaders describe quadrants using the quadrants’ \nrelative locations. The examples in figure 8-8 illustrate the target array technique. \nChapter 8 \n8-18 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016\nLegend:  TRP = target reference point \nFigure 8-8. Examples of target array \nFIRE COMMANDS \n8-77. Fire commands are oral orders issued by leaders to direct and distribute fires when necessary to \nachieve decisive effects against the enemy. They allow leaders to rapidly and concisely articulate their \nfiring instructions using a standard format. Unit fire commands (refer to ATTP 3-21.9 for more information \non fire commands) include these elements, which are discussed below: \nAlert.\nWeapon or ammunition (optional).\nTarget description.\nOrientation.\nRange (optional).\nControl (optional).\nExecution.\n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 A-1 Appendix A \nBreaching Using MGS \nThe Stryker Infantry rifle company has the capability to breach structures using the \nMGS. This technique requires the Infantry and MGS working in direct coordination \nwith one another to accomplish their common goal. This procedure is dangerous and \nrisk mitigation factors must be implemented to execute successfully. When executed \ncorrectly the Infantry have a significant advantage when they enter and clear a \nstructure because of the shock of the impacting round created at the breach point and \ninside the structure from the MGS. \nSECTION I – PLAN \nA-1. Commanders quickly decide if conducting the breach using MGS is the best technique for the \nsituation. The factors of METT-TC and ROE will assist the commander in this decision. Commanders \nweigh the distance of the Infantry element to the breach point in their planning. If the Infantry cannot \nquickly assault the breach point, the enemy may have an opportunity to reinforce or recover from the blast. \nA-2. Many factors make this technique potentially dangerous and each need to be addressed and \nmitigated. Planning for a breach in an urban environment using the MGS has many planning considerations \nincluding — \nInfantry placement.\nTarget breach point.\nStructure/wall construction type.\nMunition selection and arming distance.\nBlast effect radius.\nA-3. Risk mitigation of the Infantry element is critical and should include mitigating the effects of the \nenvironment such as — \nBlast effects and radius of debris.\nHearing protection.\nPersonnel protective posture.\nThe distance to place infantry from the breach point.\nSurface danger zones (SDZs) of the MGS.\nA-4. MGS vehicle commanders coordinate directly with the Infantry squad/platoon to determine the \nbreach point. Infantry elements need to have a means to mark the breach point. This could include the \nfollowing: \nLaser pointer.\nSmoke.\nChalk (if site exterior is secure).\n40-mm target practice tracer (TPT) round.\nMark with tracer (least preferred as it indicates Infantry positions).\nA-5. Wall and structure considerations include all the different types of material used in construction and \nmay include concrete, reinforced concrete with rebar, mud, brick, and cinder blocks, stone, wood, and so \nforth. The composition and thickness of the structure will be an indicator for the type of munitions used and \nthe number of rounds needed to create the breach point. For a reinforced concrete rebar wall the most likely \nround to use would be HEP as opposed to a wooden structure where one canister round may be preferred. \nAppendix A \nA-2 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  Consideration of the structure that the wall supports and the support structures within the building need to \nbe taken into account . The round may not stop at the point of impact but may proceed into the structure. \nCalculating where the support structures are for the engagement will allow the person marking the target \nand the gunner to engage. To collapse the structure the gunner will target its support. To create a breach \npoint the gunner would avoid damaging the support. \nA-6. Munitions selection may include the following rounds; high-explosive plastic tracer (HEP-T), high-\nexplosive antitank tracer (HEAT-T), and canister. Each has capabilities suited for engaging different types \nof structures. Arming distances of these munitions is a major consideration. See table A-1 for the arming \ndistances for each type of round: \nTable A-1.

The \nangle of the MGS to the breach point may extend the blast and debris field and should also be considered. \nWhenever possible a zero degree obliquity to the target breach point is desired. Targets cannot exceed more \nthan 80 degree obliquity to the target. (See figure A-1 on page A-3.)  \nBreaching Using MGS \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 A-3 \nLegend:  5° = variation of aim, 10° = ricochet of round, 25° = explosion of round along gun target line out \n300M, Area B = explosion at impact point 300M, GTL = gun target line, M = meter \nFigure A-1. Safety zones \nSECTION II – PREPARE \nA-8. Preparing involves setting conditions to engage, emplacement of troops, marking the target, and \ncommunication between breach element and MGS. It covers the suppress, obscure, and secure steps of \nSOSRA. \nSUPPRESS \nA-9. To prepare for the breach the Stryker Infantry or another MGS vehicle must suppress the enemy \nforces long enough to allow the breach team to mark the target. The MGS can be used to suppress the \nenemy during this process but risks loss of coordination with the breach team; which may cause the breach \nteam having to remark the breach point, or the suppressing effort to last longer.  \nA-10.  Marking the target includes placing the breach point on the structure with a visual marking to \nallow the gunner in the MGS vehicle to target a specific point. The breach team should mark the target \nbreach point in respects to its potential collateral damage such as ensuring that the breach point is not part \nAppendix A \nA-4 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016of a supporting foundation of the structure, has enough distance that gunner can identify, and the round \nfired from the MGS has time to arm.   \nA-11.  Communication should be maintained with Infantry elements and vehicle crewmembers, constantly. \nDuring the marking process the MGS vehicle guides the Infantry to ensure they can identify the breach \npoint while the Infantry ensure that the point of the breach can meet the intent of the task. \nOBSCURE \nA-12.  Obscuration with smoke grenade salvos from the Stryker vehicles or hand held grenades can assist \nin obscuration. This assists the breach team during the marking process. Smoke should be directed towards \nenemy positions and if possible placed inside the enemy structure if ROE permits. Smoke should be used in \nshort duration and if possible not obscure the breach point when the breach team and MGS are \ncoordinating.  \nSECURE \nA-13.  Isolating the target building ensures that criteria have been met to conduct the breach. If possible, \nplacing the MGS in a position to limit collateral damage to adjacent buildings and noncombat personnel \nwhen executing the breach is optimal. Infantry should be placed in an area with proper protection that \nallows them to conduct the breach quickly but far enough away to ensure they are not compromised by \neither the effects of the MGS engagement or the enemy. \nSECTION III – EXECUTE \nA-14.  Execution begins reduction step of SOSRA and ends with the assault. The Infantry elements \nconduct target handoff to the MGS vehicle to reduce the structure by establishing a breaching point . Before \nengaging, the MGS will ensure all personnel are in a safe position. When confirmation is received the MGS \nvehicle announces it is engaging.  \nREDUCE \nA-15.  The MGS will fire one round and then make an assessment through its sights as to whether further \nrounds are needed (based on wall construction type). Once the MGS has determined that the breach hole is \nthe appropriate size they will signal the breaching team. Upon receiving the signal the breach team begins \nits movement from its protective posi tion to the breach point. (See figure A-2 on page A-5 .) \nBreaching Using MGS \n4 February 2016  ATP 3-21.11 A-5 \nFigure A-2. MGS wall breach execution \nASSAULT \nA-16.  When the breaching team reaches the breach point, they will quickly assess the viability of the \nbreach. This assessment includes: structural support stability, hole size, and need for further improvement. \nIf the breach hole is stable and of the appropriate size the breaching team will continue the mission by \nentering the breach point. (See figure A-3.) The MGS will shift fires to cover the approach to the breaching \npoint and ingress and egress as appropriate. Upon completion of clearing the structure the breaching team \nmakes a more thorough assessment to ensure the structure is not going to collapse.   \nAppendix A \nA-6 ATP 3-21.11 4 February 2016  \nFigure A-3.

provides doctrinal framework for techniques for the stryker brigade combat team (sbct) infantry rifle company within the sbct. this atp provides employment of the sbct infantry rifle company in decisive action. this atp provides doctrinal guidance for commanders, staff, and leaders who are responsible for planning, preparing, executing, and assessing operations of the sbct infantry rifle company. it serves as an authoritative reference for personnel developing, materiel and force structure, institutional and unit training, and standard operating procedures (sop) for sbct infantry rifle company operations. this atp supplements the doctrinal material found in fm 3-96 . commanders, staffs, and subordinates ensure that their decisions and actions comply with applicable united states, international, and in some cases host-nation laws and regulations. commanders at all levels ensure that their soldiers operate in accordance with the law of war and the rules of engagement. (see fm 27-10.) atps contain techniques that are nonprescriptive ways or methods used to perform missions, functions, or tasks. they are intended to be used as a guide to supplement doctrinal material published in active field manuals. this atp outlines the framework that the sbct infantry rifle company will operate separately or as part of a combined arms team. it includes discussions of doctrine that is applicable to all companies. atp 3-21.11 uses joint terms where applicable. selected joint and army terms and definitions appear in both the glossary and the text. terms for which atp 3-21.11 is the proponent publication (the authority) are italicized in the text and are marked with an asterisk (*) in the glossary. terms and definitions for which atp 3-21.11 is the proponent publication are boldfaced in the text. for definitions shown in the text, the term is italicized and the number of the proponent publication follows the definition. this publication applies to the active army, the army national guard/army national guard of the united states (arngus), and the united states (u.s.) army reserve, unless otherwise stated. unless otherwise stated, whenever the masculine gender is used, both men and women are implied. the proponent for this publication is the united states army training and doctrine command (tradoc). the preparing agency is the u.s. army maneuver center of excellence (mcoe). comments and recommendations can be sent by any means—u.s. mail, e-mail, fax, or telephone —using the format of da form 2028, recommended changes to publications and blank forms . point of contact information follows: e-mail: usarmy.benning.mcoe.mbx.doctrine@mail.mil phone: com 706-545-7114 or dsn 835-7114 fax: com 706-545-8511 or dsn 835-8511 u.s. mail: commanding general, maneuver center of excellence directorate of training and doctrine doctrine and collective training division attn: atzb-tdd fort benning, ga 31905-5410 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 ix introduction a tp 3-21.11, the sbct infantry rifle company of the stryker brigade combat team (sbct), discusses the techniques used by the infantry rifle company while conducting missions. these are techniques and are not prescriptive. mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, and civil considerations (mett-tc) condition will dictate how the company commander accomplishes his tasks. this manual provides the commander and his subordinates with an array of methods that can be used or modified. a tp 3-21.11 has eight chapters and one appendix. the chapters consist of an organizational chapter and a chapter on offense, defense, and stability operations. defense support to civilian authorities and defense support of civil authority (dsca) is not covered. throughout the chapters, tactical enabling operations are included in the discussions. the chapters and the appendix use examples and illustrations to show techniques that can be used. doctrine is included only to the extent of understanding the context and relationships between techniques. the following text below compares the table of contents of a tp 3-21.11 and fm 3-21.11. the chapters and sections of fm 3-21.11 are reorganized and updated to adhere to the standards of an a tp. for parts of fm 3-21.11 that have no corresponding discussion in the a tp, the applicable publication is listed in parenthesis. this manual incorporates the significant changes in army doctrinal terminology, concepts, constructs, and proven tactics developed during recent operations. it also incorporates doctrinal terms and changes based on doctrine 2015. note. this manual is written based on the current structure of the sbct and its subordinate units. the organizational charts in chapter 1 illustrate the structure of the sbct infantry rifle company for this publication. future changes to the organizational structures of the sbct infantry rifle company will be published as change documents to the manual. the following is a brief introduction and summary of changes by chapter. chapter 1 – organization chapter 1 addresses the organizational characteristics of the sbct infantry rifle company as optimized and trained to conduct offensive and defensive tasks, and operations in support of stability to function across the range of military operations. chapter 1 describes the organization and mission of the company, each of its subordinate elements as well as the duties and responsibilities of its key leaders. chapter 2 – offense chapter 2 discusses offensive actions to destroy, defeat, or neutralize the enemy. the chapter addresses the characteristics of a sbct infantry rifle company offense and describes the movement to contact, attack tasks, and considerations when participating in exploitation, and pursuit. chapter 2 also discusses — common offensive planning considerations. forms of maneuver.

blank. 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 1-1 chapter 1 organization and capabilities the primary mission of the sbct infantry rifle company is to close with the enemy by means of maneuver to destroy or capture him, or to repel his assault by fire, close combat, and counterattack. the sbct infantry rifle company can be deployed rapidly and can be sustained by an austere support structure for up to 72 hours of independent operations . sbct conducts operations against threat forces in all types of terrain and weather conditions. the sbct infantry rifle company is ready to adapt to various environments. this requires bold, aggressive, resourceful, and adaptive leaders who are willing to accept prudent risks to accomplish the mission. this chapter emphasizes the role, organization, capabilities, duties and responsibilities within the sbct infantry rifle company. section i – operational overview 1-1. an operation is a series of tactical actions with a common purpose or unifying theme. a tactical action is a battle or engagement, employing lethal or nonlethal actions, designed for a specific purpose relative to the enemy, the terrain, friendly forces, or other entity. tactical actions include widely varied activities such as an attack to seize a piece of terrain or destroy an enemy unit, the defense of a population , and the training of other militaries to assist security forces as part of building partner capacity. unified land operations 1-2. unified land operations describes how the army seizes, retains, and exploits the initiative to gain and maintain a position of relative advantage in sustained land operations. through decisive action (simultaneous combination of offensive, defensive, and stability tasks) unified land operations can prevent or deter conflict, prevail in war, and create the conditions for favorable conflict resolution. 1-3. a unified land operation is the army’s operational concept and the army’s contribution to unified action. the four foundations of unified land operations are initiative, decisive action, army core competencies (wide area security and combined arms maneuver), and mission command. (refer to adrp 3-0 for a more in-depth discussion of unified land operations and its tenets.) the sbct infantry rifle company supports the army’s operational concept with their organization, equipment, capabiliti es, leadership, training, and soldiers. operational environment 1-4. the operational environment is a composite of the conditions, circumstances, and influences that affect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander (joint publication (jp) 3-0). the operational environment of the infantry battalion includes all enemy, adversarial, friendly, and neutral systems across the range of military operations. the operational environment includes an understanding of the physical environment, the state of governance, technology, local resources, and the culture of the local population. the operational environment for each operation is different, and it evolves as the operation progresses. the company must train agile and adaptive leaders who can understand, adapt, and successfully operate within the current operational environment. 1-5. when the infantry company is alerted for deployment, redeployment within a theater of operations, or assigned a mission, its assigned higher headquarters provides an analysis of the operational environment. that analysis includes the operational variables: political, military, economic, social, information, infrastructure, physical environment, and time (pmesii-pt ). chapter 1 1-2 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 1-6. upon receipt of a mission, the commander assisted by his company intelligence support team (coist) if formed, filter information categorized by the operational variables into relevant information with respect to the mission. leaders use the mission variables to analyze missions enabling them to combine operational variables and tactical-level information with knowledge about local conditions relevant to their mission. the mission variables are: mett- tc. refer to adrp 6.0 for more information. threat 1-7. a threat is any combination of actors, entities, or forces that have the capability and intent to harm united states forces, united states national interests, or the homeland (adrp 3-0) . threats may include individuals, groups of individuals (organized or not organized), paramilitary or military forces, nationstates, or national alliances. when threats execute their capability to do harm to the united states, they become enemies. it is critical that the sbct infantry rifle company understands the threat in their operational environment. 1-8. in general, the various actors in any operational area can qualify as a threat, an enemy, an adversary, a neutral, or a friend. an enemy is a party identified as hostile against which the use of force is authorized (adrp 3-0). an enemy is also called a combatant and is treated as such under the law of war. an adversary is a party acknowledged as potentially hostile to a friendly party and against which the use of force may be envisaged (jp 3-0). an adversary becomes an enemy when friendly forces take action against them. a neutral is a party identified as neither supporting nor opposing friendly or enemy forces. land operations often prove complex because a threat, an enemy, an adversary, a neutral, or a friend intermix, often with no easy means to distinguish one from another. the sbct infantry rifle company must engage with the various actors to determine categories they may display characteristics of. building relationships and trust is key to influencing neutral and adversaries from moving towards the enemy goals . hybrid threat 1-9. the term hybrid threat has evolved to capture the seemingly increased complexity of operations, the multiplicity of actors involved, and the blurring between traditional elements of conflict. a hybrid threat is the diverse and dynamic combination of regular forces, irregular forces, terrorist forces, or criminal elements unified to achieve mutually benefitting effects. hybrid threats combine regular forces governed by international law, military tradition, and custom with unregulated forces that act with no restrictions on violence or their targets. these may involve nation-state actors that employ protracted forms of warfare, possibly using proxy forces to coerce and intimidate, or nonstate actors using operational concepts and high-end capabilities traditionally associated with states. such varied forces and capabilities enable hybrid threats to capitalize on perceived vulnerabilities, making them particularly effective. (refer to adrp 3-0 for more information.) 1-10. today and in the future, the sbct will be called upon to fight and win against regular forces, irregular forces , terrorist forces, and criminal elements that employ unconventional and terrorist tactics, and hybrid threats that combine conventional, unconventional, and terrorist capabilities and methods to meet their strategic goals and political aims. threat capabilities , tactics , and techniques 1-11. current and future enemies and adversaries will seek to counter u.s. advantages in information collection capabilities, long-range precision fires, armor protection and mobility, communications, and combined-arms integration by employing a series of integrated tactical and technical countermeasures. enemy tactical countermeasures will consist of deception operations, dispersion, concealment, and the intermingling with civilians in urban terrain. complementing these tactical techniques, the enemy will employ technological countermeasures such as cyber attacks and global positioning system jamming to evade and disrupt u.s. forces’ ability to develop the situation, seize the initiative, and consolidate tactical gains into favorable political outcomes. unified action 1-12. unified action is the synchronization, coordination, and/or integration of the activities of governmental and nongovernmental entities with military operations to achieve unity of effort (jp 1). as military forces synchronize actions, they achieve unity of effort. unified action includes actions of military organization and capabilities 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 1-3 forces synchronized with activities of other government agencies, nongovernmental and intergovernmental organizations, and the private sector. military forces play a key role in unified action before, during, and after operations through engagement. the army’s contribution to unified action is unified land operations. 1-13. army forces coordinate operations with unified action partners. unified action partners are those military forces, governmental and nongovernmental organizations, and elements of the private sector with whom army forces plan, coordinate, synchronize, and integrate during the conduct of operations. unified action partners include joint forces and components, multinational forces, and u.s. government agencies and departments (adrp 3-0). foundations of unified land operations 1-14. commanders can achieve strategic success by integrating the four foundations of unified land operations initiative, decisive action, core competencies, and mission command. the foundations of unified land operations begin and end with the exercise of individual and operational initiative. initiative 1-15. all army operations aim to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative and achieve decisive results. operational initiative is setting or dictating the terms of action throughout an operation. individual initiative is the willingness to act in the absence of orders, when existing orders no longer fit the situation, or when unforeseen opportunities or threats arise (adrp 3-0). initiative gives all operations the spirit, if not the form, of the offense. it originates in the principle of war of the offensive. this principle goes beyond simply attacking. it requires action to change the situation on the ground. risk and opportunity are intrinsic in seizing the initiative. to seize the initiative, commanders evaluate and take prudent risks as necessary to exploit opportunities. initiative requires constant effort to control tempo and momentum while maintaining freedom of action. this offensive mindset, with its focus on initiative, is central to the army’s operational concept and guides all leaders in the performance of their duty. it emphasizes opportunity created by developing the situation through decisive action, whether in offensive, defensive, stability, or defense support of civil authority’s tasks ( refer to adrp 3-0 for more information). decisive a ction 1-16. the stryker infantry rifle company is optimally designed to conduct decisive action through its equipment and task organization in every theat er of conflict. decisive action requires continuous, simultaneous combinations of offensive , defensive, stability, and defense support of civil authorities’ tasks . sbct infantry rifle companies are prepared to conduct any combination of these elements (described below) either independently, or as part of a larger force. (refer to adrp 3-0 for more information.) offensive tasks 1-17. an offensive task is a task conducted to defeat and destroy enemy forces and seize terrain, resources, and population centers (adrp 3-0). they impose the commander’s will on the enemy. seizing and retaining the initiative requires executing offensive tasks at some point even when conducting defensive tasks. they accomplish this through using mission command to direct and coordinate tasks that allow them to see the threat first, maneuver to a position of advantage and finish decisively. defensive tasks 1-18. a defensive task is a task conducted to defeat an enemy attack, gain time, economize forces, and develop conditions favorable for offensive or stability tasks (adrp 3-0). successful defenses are aggressive and commanders use all available means to disrupt enemy forces. the sbct infantry rifle company uses the defense to occupy territory and initiate mass effects on enemy forces to repel their assault by fire, close combat, and counterattack. stability tasks 1-19. stability tasks include various missions, tasks, and activities conducted outside the u.s. these tasks are coordinated with other instruments of national power to maintain or reestablish a safe and secure environment, restore essential government services, and provide emergency infrastructure reconstruction chapter 1 1-4 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016and humanitarian relief ( adp 3-07). the sbct infantry rifle company supports stability tasks by performing company level missions, tasks, and activities that support a safe and secure environment, provide essential governmental services, emergency infrastructure reconstruction, and humanitarian relief. defense support of civil authorities 1-20. defense support of civil authority is the department of defense’s (dod) support to u.s. civil authorities for domestic emergencies, and for designated law enforcement and other activities. forces conduct defense support of civil authority tasks only within the u.s. to protect her possessions and territories. u.s. army forces conduct defense support of civil authority when the size and scope of events exceed the capabilities or capacities of domestic civilian agencies. army defense support of civil authority includes four primary tasks (refer to adrp 3-28): provide support for domestic disaster. provide support for domestic chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosive (cbrne) incidents. provide support for domestic civilian law enforcement agencies. provide other designated support. 1-21. stryker units are capable to support defense support of civil authority due to their mobility and formation specifications. they provide the ability to carry the support needed for all tasks for its personnel and partnered forces for sustained periods of time. it can operate in the same areas as many of the vehicles the civil authority operate in. core competencies 1-22. although distinct by definition, combined arms maneuver and wide area security are inseparable and simultaneous. combined arms maneuver and wide area security provide the army a focus for decisive action and as a construct for understanding how army forces use combined arms to achieve success in this contest of wills. as core competencies, combined arms maneuver and wide area security uniquely define what the army provides to the joint force commander (jfc). additionally, the army is organized and equipped to support the jfc through combined arms to cover vast distances for extended periods. the army works to integrate all available instruments to unified action partners to achieve the desired outcome (adrp 3-0). combined arms maneuver 1-23. combined arms maneuver is the application of the elements of combat power in unified action to defeat enemy ground forces; to seize, occupy, and defend land areas; and to achieve physical, temporal, and psychological advantages over the enemy to seize and exploit the initiative (adrp 3-0). 1-24. combined arms maneuver for an sbct infantry rifle company is more than just the combined arms maneuverability from within the company, battalion, or the sbct itself. it is using all available asset s possible to keep the enemy off balance and to have a better situational understanding of your operational environment (oe). because of the multiple assets available with in the company itself, for example, snipers, mortars, infantry, and mgs vehicles , and throughout the sbct, the sbct infantry rifle company has the ability to task-organize for combined arms maneuver. some of these assets could come from other units inside and outside of the sbct, sister services, north atlantic treaty organization (nato), or host-nation security forces (hnsf) when available. wide area security 1-25. wide area security is the application of the elements of combat power in unified action to protect populations, forces, infrastructure, and activities; to deny the enemy positions of advantage; and to consolidate gains in order to retain the initiative (adrp 3-0). reconnaissance and security tasks provide a foundation to support successful wide area security. this allows the company commander to understand the operational environment and to protect the local population and the unit. as with combined arms maneuver, successful wide area security involves all available assets from inside and outside of the sbct infantry rifle company. organization and capabilities 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 1-5 combat power 1-26. combat power is the total means of destructive, constructive, and information capabilities that a military unit or formation can apply at a given time (adp 3-0). sbct infantry rifle companies generate combat power by converting potential into effective action. infantry company commanders conceptualize their capabilities in terms of combat power. combat power has eight elements, the six warfighting functions —mission command, movement and maneuver, intelligence, fires, sustainment, and protection — plus leadership, and information. commanders apply the warfighting functions using leadership and information throughout to multiply the effects of combat power. 1-27. sbct infantry rifle company commanders understand, visualize, describe, direct, and lead operations and training in terms of the warfighting functions. decisive, shaping, and sustaining operations combine all the warfighting functions to generate combat power. no warfighting function is a stand-alone entity or capability. (refer to adrp 3-0 for more information.) leadership 1-28. leadership is the process of influencing people by providing purpose, direction, and motivation, to accomplish the mission and improve the organization ( adp 6-22). leaders, by virtue of their assumed role or assigned responsibility, inspire and influence people to accomplish the mission. leaders motivate soldiers to pursue actions, reemphasize thinking, and shape decisions for the greater good of the organization. they instill in soldiers the will to win. 1-29. leadership within the sbct infantry rifle company requires bold, aggressive, resourceful, and adaptive initiatives that force soldiers to take actions that support their leaders’ intent. leaders should be willing to accept prudent risks to accomplish the mission. the sbct infantry rifle company challenges leaders to think quickly and act decisively to seize the initiative from the enemy. the techniques used within the sbct differ from armored brigade combat team (abct) and infantry brigade combat team (ibct) in that infantry normally operate in front of their stryker vehicle during maneuver requiring leadership to focus on synchronization of their efforts. information 1-30. information that is analyzed and developed into actionable intelligence is a powerful tool in the operational environment. in modern conflict, information and analyzing that information has become nearly as important as lethal action when determining success or failure of operations at all levels. every engagement or major operation requires supporting information operations to ensure successful mission accomplishment. commanders use analyzed information to understand, visualize, describe, and direct the warfighting functions. 1-31. soldiers use information to persuade, inform, and influence target audiences. information helps shape the perceptions of the civilian population. commanders conduct reconnaissance to collect information in order to make timely decisions to shape the operational environment. enemy forces, neutral, and friendly populations use information to convey their message. information can be critical in decisive action and is particularly critical in stability tasks where popular support is a major factor in success or failure. 1-32. information systems provide leaders with the information they need to enhance and reemphasize the warfighting functions. relevant information enables the sbct infantry company commander to make informed decisions on how to apply combat power. the force xxi battle command-brigade and below (fbcb2) computer-displayed common operational picture (cop) is a good example. it can provide sbct infantry company commanders with improved situational awareness (sa) by merging information into displays that infantry soldiers can understand at a glance. cops do not always include terrain based systems such as fbcb2 and command post of the future (cpof). they can also contain data bases that describe the civil considerations as well in such systems as tactical ground reporting (tigr) net and biometrics automated toolset system/handheld interagency identity detection equipment (bats/hiide) systems. accurate intelligence disseminated quickly through information systems enables the sbct infantry rifle company to maneuver to positions of tactical advantage while massing the effects at the decisive place and time. chapter 1 1-6 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016warfighting functions 1-33. a warfighting function is a group of tasks and systems (people, organizations, information, and processes) united by a common purpose that commanders use to accomplish missions and training objectives (adrp 3-0). all warfighting functions possess scalable capabilities to mass lethal and nonlethal effects. no warfighting function is exclusively decisive, shaping, or sustaining, but may contain elements of more than one type of operation. (refer to adrp 3-0 for more information.) commanders use the following warfighting functions to help them exercise mission command. mission command 1-34. the mission command warfighting function is the related tasks and systems that develop and integrate those activities enabling a commander to balance the art of command and the science of control in order to integrate the other warfighting functions (adrp 3-0). mission command uses mission orders to ensure the use of disciplined initiative within the commander's intent, enabling agile and adaptive commanders, leaders, and organizations. 1-35. in the sbct infantry rifle company, the company commander is the central figure in mission command. the commander is essential to integrating the capabilities of the warfighting functions to accomplish the mission. mission command invokes the greatest possible freedom of action to subordinates, facilitating their abilities to develop the situation, adapt, and act decisively through disciplined initiative within the commander’s intent. it focuses on empowering subordinate leaders and sharing information to facilitate decentralized execution. (refer to section iii of this chapter for more information.) 1-36. the sbct infantry company commander is provided with a full suite of networked enabled, mission command capabilities that allow them to gain and maintain situational awareness of friendly units and enemy activity, in near-real time, and allows them to synchronize assets and warfighting functions at their echelon of command. additionally, the sbct infantry company commander has mission command access to secure elements of information from the brigade through the squad level, allowing for situational awareness of their organic assets, adjacent units, and echelons above company level. this networkedenabled mission command capability also enables the commander with a reach-back capability for products, preformatted reports, information, and staff analysis support from echelons above the company level. the commander also has the capability to establish a static, command post (cp) and perform mission command and coist activities. movement and maneuver 1-37. the movement and maneuver warfighting function is the related tasks and systems that move and employ forces to achieve a position of relative advantage over the enemy and other threats (adrp 3-0). the company commander concentrates combat power using movement and maneuver to achieve surprise, shock, momentum, and dominance. effective maneuver for sbct units requires close coordination with fires and synchronization with infantry operating in front of their stryker vehicles. intelligence 1-38. the intelligence warfighting function is the related tasks and systems that facilitate understanding the enemy, terrain, and civil considerations (adrp 3-0). these tasks are interrelated, require the participation of the command and staff, and are often conducted simultaneously. the intelligence warfighting function tasks facilitate the commander’s visualization and understanding of the threat and other relevant aspects of the operational environment. the coist assists the commander in the conduct of mission analysis and with analysis of information. combat information is disseminated rapidly throughout the sbct often laterally and vertically. fires 1-39. the fires warfighting function comprises tasks and systems that provide collective and coordinated use of army indirect fires and joint fires through the targeting process. it includes tasks that integrate and synchronize the effects of these types of fires with the other warfighting functions (see adp 3-0). the sbct infantry rifle company leadership integrates direct and indirect fires in conjunction with one another from varying echelons of direct and indirect fire systems from organic, attached, and augmented assets. organization and capabilities 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 1-7 sustainment 1-40. the sustainment warfighting function is the related tasks and systems that provide support and services to ensure freedom of action, extend operational reach, and prolong endurance (adp 3-0) . the sustainment warfighting function includes the following tasks: conduct logistics. provide personnel services. provide health service support. 1-41. sbct infantry rifle company conducts sustainment in coordination with the sbct infantry battalion and logistical elements from the brigade support battalion (bsb) often directly to ensure that sustainment needs are met. protection 1-42. the protection warfighting functi on is the related tasks and systems that preserve the force so the commander can apply maximum combat power to accomplish the mission (adrp 3-0). preserving the force includes protecting personnel (combatant and noncombatant), physical assets, and information of the united states and multinational partners. section ii – organization 1-43. sbct infantry rifle companies are optimized to conduct decisive action. the sbct rifle company’s combat power resides mostly with in its three rifle platoons —each with three infantry rifle squads, a weapons squad, and four stryker infantry carrier vehicles. sbct infantry rifle companies deploy worldwide to conduct unified land operations. organization 1-44. the sbct infantry rifle company, figure 1-1, can operate independently or as a combined arms force based upon mission variables. its effectiveness is increased through the synergy of combined arms to include tanks, field artillery, aviation, intelligence, engineers, and other support elements. effective application of the sbct infantry rifle company as a combined arms force can capitalize on the strengths of the company’s elements while minimizing their respective limitations. 1-45. sbct infantry units can operate effectively in all terrain and weather conditions. they might be the dominant arm in operations because of their rapid strategic deployment and mobility capability. in such cases, they can gain the initiative early, seize and hold ground, and mass fires to stop the enemy. infantry units are particularly effective in the urban environment, where they can maneuver rapidly in close contact to positions of tactical advantage against enemy positions. 1-46. the missions, types, equipment, capabilities, limitations, and organization of infantry units are the fundamental considerations for employing sbct infantry rifle companies. these considerations are further effected by the unit's training program, leadership, morale, personnel strengths, and other factors. these other factors constantly change based on the current situation. chapter 1 1-8 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 legend: atgm = antitank guided missile, cal = caliber, intel = intelligence, fsv= fire support vehicle, mg = machine gun, mm = millimeter. figure 1-1. sbct infantry rifle company 1-47. the sbct infantry rifle company has the ability to task-organize within itself to meet specific missions based on mett-tc. it can attach a sniper team, fire support vehicle (fsv), or a mgs to infantry platoons. sbct infantry rifle company within the sbct infantry battalion 1-48. the sbct infantry rifle company within the sbct infantry battalions can deploy rapidly and be sustained by a minimal support structure. the company's composition and training uniquely equip it to conduct its mission against conventional and unconventional enemy forces in all types of terrain and climate conditions. the company can support offensive, defensive, and stability or defense support of civil authority tasks semi-independently or as a part of a larger force. it can be task-organized as part of an infantry battalion, a combined arms battalion (cab), an ibct, an abct, or a support battalion or brigade. (see chapter 8 for a discussion of sustainment techniques associated with a stryker company taskorganized to these other types of units.) capabilities and limitations 1-49. the sbct combines the tactical mobility aspect of mechanized units while emphasizing and exploiting where the infantry fight occurs. the following list highlights the capabilities and limitations of the sbct infantry rifle company. 1-50. capabilities — increased combat power from a standard infantry company with the addition of a fourth platoon (mobile gun system platoon). increased tactical mobility for infantry. carries and employs assortment of weapons to the fight with a “mobile arms room” concept. equipped with organic 120-mm and 60-mm mortars. authorized organic sniper team. self-sustained for 72 hours or mission dependent fuel consumption rates. organization and capabilities 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 1-9 conduct offensive, defensive, and stability tasks in all types of environments. seize, secure, occupy, and retain terrain. destroy, neutralize, suppress, interdict, disrupt, block, canalize, and fix enemy forces. breach enemy obstacles. can conduct feints and demonstrations to deceive the enemy. reconnoiters, denies, bypasses, clears, contains, and isolates. (these tasks might be oriented on both terrain and enemy.) operates in conjunction with mounted or special operations forces. 1-51. limitations — vulnerable to indirect fires while dismounted. reduced company logistical systems. has no organic maintenance section. unable to conduct forced entry by air; requires preoperational staging point. vulnerable to enemy armor, artillery, and air assets when employed in open terrain. vulnerable to enemy chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (cbrn) attacks with limited decontamination capability. sbct infantry rifle platoon 1-52. the stryker infantry rifle platoon is a versatile force that can fight in unison with a mounted force supporting a dismounted force or as a purely dismounted force. the stryker infantry carrier vehicle (icv) is a platform that is designed to provide protection and mobility to the infantry element. it facilitates the infantry to seize the initiative by deploying to positions of tactical advantage. the stryker vehicle is not a fighting vehicle and lacks the protection and lethality to initiate contact and destroy enemy fighting platforms. the infantry platoon has one officer and 44 enlisted personnel in a platoon headquarters, three stryker infantry weapons squads, and one stryker infantry weapons squad. additionally the platoon is augmented with an fo and a medic as habitual attachments. 1-53. the stryker infantry rifle platoons can fight as in multiple mutually supporting maneuver elements to include: squad leader controls two infantry fire teams and stryker icv. the squad leader fights the infantry squad while the icvs move in vehicle sections under a section leader. the platoon fights infantry squads with icvs in support . the platoon fights infantry squads and icvs as separate formations and conduct a linkup . 1-54. the stryker infantry rifle platoon relies on its mission command and intent based orders to accomplish the mission. the platoon facilitates lower level leadership to seize the initiative through intent based orders with higher level leadership synchronizing their actions. mgs platoon 1-55. the mgs platoon provides direct supporting fires to infantry squads during the assault. its function is to destroy or suppress hardened enemy bunkers, machine gun positions, and sniper positions. it also creates infantry breach points in urban, restricted, and open rolling terrain. the mgs 105 mm main gun provides the platoon with limited anti-armor, self-defense capabilities. the mgs is not a tank, however, and should not be employed in the same manner as a tank; nor should the mgs platoon be employed in the same manner as a tank platoon. 1-56. the mgs offers an array of capabilities on the modern battlefield. it can move rapidly in a variety of terrain conditions, negotiating soft ground, shallow trenches, small trees, and limited obstacles. the following factors, in combination, produce the shock effect that allows the mgs to close with and destroy the enemy in most weather and light conditions: cross-country mobility. enhanced target acquisition. chapter 1 1-10 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016lethal firepower. medium-strength armor protection. 1-57. the mgs is limited when it operates in restricted terrain such as built-up areas or dense woods. the reduction of visibility limits the crew ’s situational awareness and creates vulnerability to dismounted enemy attacks. in such situations, the mgs usually requires that mounted or infantrymen provide flank and overwatch security to maintain its maneuverability and observation advantage 1-58. the mgs platoon provides four different ways to operate within the sbct infantry rifle company based on a commander’s operational considerations. (refer to atp 3 -20.16 for more information.) they are as follows: individual mgs vehicles under infantry platoon control. in this technique, each mgs vehicle is task-organized to an infantry platoon. the purpose of this type of task organization is to provide all the infantry platoons with increased direct fire for suppression and breaching, specifically in urban areas. mgs platoon retained under company control. in this technique, the mgs platoon is responsible for maneuvering the mgs vehicles according to the company commander’s intent. mgs platoon minus (-) under company control and an mgs vehicle under infantry platoon control. in this technique, the mgs platoon detaches one vehicle to the control of an infantry platoon. the selected maneuver infantry platoon has an mgs vehicle available to support the close fight, and the company commander has an mgs platoon (-) to deploy at the critical place and time of his choosing. mortar section 1-59. mortars sections are organic to all sbct infantry rifle companies. the mission of mortars is to provide immediate and close supporting fires to the maneuver forces in contact. the primary role of the company mortar section is to provide immediate, responsive indirect fires in support of maneuver elements . the mortar section is comprised of the fire direction center (fdc), and two mortar squads. the fdc controls and directs mortar fires. sbct infantry rifle company mortar squads are each equipped with mounted 120-mm and dismounted 60-mm mortars. (refer to army tactics, techniques, and procedures (attp) 3-21.90 for more information about mortars.) sniper team 1-60. sniper tasks apply to most operations conducted by the sbct infantry rifle company. the following discussion is not inclusive and each unit sniper employment officer should develop the sniper tasks based on the unit commander’s intent and operational requirements. provide long-range precision fire 1-61. the sniper supports combat operations by delivering long-range precision fire on key selected targets and targets of oppo rtunity. some specific missions include― accurate fire. command posts and key enemy leaders. crew-served weapons and crews. bunkers and embrasures. key enemy equipment. selected targets just prior to an attack. security or cover for. friendly engineers, demolition guards, and supply columns. obstacles, key terrain and defiles. counterattack routes. flanks. countersnip er missions. ambushes or harassment of withdrawing enemy. organization and capabilities 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 1-11 covering fire for observation posts or fire positions. observation and control of indirect fire onto enemy positions. collect and report battlefield information 1-62. the sniper team’s alternate mission is always reconnaissance conducted by static surveillance. they use their advanced optics to collect and report detailed battlefield information from concealed positions. atp 3-20.98 provides more information on the fundamentals of reconnaissance and battlefield information collection and reporting. considerations 1-63. when the commander receives a mission, his decision to employ sniper teams depends on his analysis of mett-tc. the sniper employment officer assists the commander in determining exact sniper missions and the number of teams to deploy. the commander also considers — rules of engagement. collateral damage. potential mines and unexploded ordinance. shoot-on -command capability. reconnaissance and security missions. support by the quick reaction forces. sustainment. communication. headquarters section 1-64. the sbct infantry rifle company is not resourced to operate a functional cp according to the modified table of organization and equipment (mtoe). however, establishing a cp may have a positive impact on the sbct infantry rifle company’s day -to-day performance particularly during sustained operations. 1-65. the soldiers manning the sbct infantry rifle company cp assist the commander and his subordinate leaders to prepare for missions by — provides a centralized point for information collection and dissemination, coordination, time management, and tracking the status of subordinate elements. maintains a cop to higher and adjacent units. provides communications with higher, lower, adjacent, and supporting units. assists the commander in planning, coordinating, and issuing company operations orders (opord). resourcing the command post 1-66. the most critical decision in developing a company cp is committing resources. company commanders should task organize for a command post based on the operating environment (offense, defense, stability). ideally, intelligence personnel are assigned to perform company-level intelligence tasks; however if not assigned, those duties and functions can be performed by other personnel. the level of dedicated resources (mainly personnel) to the company cp has a direct correlation to the effectiveness of the fusion between missions and locally developed intelligence. 1-67. there are several options for manning an sbct infantry rifle company cp. the basic minimum manning requirement is for two noncommissioned officers (ncos) to serve as noncommissioned officers in charge (ncoics) with two radio/ telephone operators (rtos). one nco is in charge of each shift. a third shift is ideal for longer continuous operations if it can be manned with personnel. shifts can vary between times of starts and shift changes. leaders should pay attention to circadian battle rhythm because splitting shifts based on hours of sunlight and night time can have psychological effects on soldiers. these ncos perform their duties with little or no supervision. chapter 1 1-12 atp 3-21.11 4 february 20161-68. members of the headquarters section can man needed positions in the cp, such as the rto. these members include the company command group drivers. there should be two rtos. one rto supports each shift. the rto assists the ncoic as needed to accomplish the mission. functions 1-69. the company cp assists the commander in reducing the number of items he personally tracks and reports. this frees him to conduct troop leading procedures (tlp) during the preparation phase. examples of cp operations include the following: record incoming and outgoing information such as status reports, warning orders (warnords), opords, and fragmentary orders (fragords). continuously refine the situational template using the latest intelligence and distribute the updated situational template to all company elements. post current guidance, timelines, and overlays. pass required reports to the battalion. track unit combat preparations and logistical status. conduct required coordination with adjacent and flank units. facilitate bottom-up refinement of planning and preparation. battle tracking. cps act as a communications retransmitting site to higher headquarters, when necessary. 1-70. the cp may be used as the point of contact for attached or operational control (opcon) units. soldiers manning the cp further assist the commander in his tlps by supervising and enforcing the timeline, reproducing overlays, and constructing sand tables for company and platoon rehearsals. the company cp is intended as an information management center during the planning and preparation phase of a mission and battle tracking during mission execution. company intelligence support team (coist) 1-71. many company commanders perform basic intelligence tasks that include refining collection capabilities, analyzing ongoing metrics in the area of operations (ao), and performing basic intelligence support to targeting. to accomplish these tasks, company commanders organize small intelligence support teams from within their units that provide meaningful intelligence. these coists do this by analyzing and reporting information collected by the company while receiving, parsing, and reporting intelligence collected by both adjacent and higher units. definition and function 1-72. a company intelligence support team is an organization formed by the company commander to perform tasks that facilitate his understanding and knowledge of the ao. coists assist a company by — developing and maintaining situational understanding and knowledge of the relevant aspects of the ao. developing information requirements. facilitating flow of information to and from company elements and the battalion s-2. turning information into intelligence. 1-73. ideally, companies organize coists as a part of the predeployment process. the coist should identify requirements based on mission variables (mett-tc) prior to arriving in the ao and analysis should include activities within the unit’s area of interest. the function of the coist is to describe the effects of the weather, enemy, terrain, and local population upon friendly operations in order to reduce the commander’s uncertainty and aid in decisi on making. this function is accomplished by gleaning intelligence from the information gathered, recommending a course of action to the commander, and disseminating any intelligence to members of the company and the higher and lateral units. the coist provides platoons with information and current intelligence concerning the company operations. the battalion intelligence cell provides an initial analysis of the ao to the company; coists refine these products based on knowledge gained by soldiers performing missions in the company ao. organization and capabilities 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 1-13 organization 1-74. ideally, a coist should consist of enough individuals to enable continuous operations and provide the depth required by the team to integrate with operations personnel and complete multiple coist tasks. 1-75. the commander identifies coist personnel as soon as possible in the army force generation (arforgen) cycle. these individuals attend home station and mobile training team training, execute coist duties during combat training center rotations, and remain in the coist throughout the deployment. the early identification, training, and stability of coist personnel ensure optimum performance. general requirements 1-76. commanders selects personnel that meet these basic requirement and attributes: authorized access to secret information. ability to organize information. ability to think, speak, and write clearly. knowledgeable of or able to learn computer skills and common office software applications. intelligence oversight 1-77. coist members are required to follow all intelligence oversight regulations, primarily ar 381-10. it specifies that army personnel cannot perform intelligence collection on u.s. persons. therefore, in compliance with ar 381-10, the coist may not collect intelligence on any u.s. person. members should receive annual intelligence oversight training to ensure they understand the regulation and are compliant. duty positions 1-78. members of a coist may include a leader, team members, and intelligence analyst. leader 1-79. the leader is responsible for the coist. the officer in charge (oic) — tasks coist members appropriately and prioritizes their work. is responsible for communicating with the battalion to verify what intelligence and collection assets are available to the company. ensures intelligence communications flow in both directions. performing the duties of coist soldiers, if necessary. providing guidance to subordinate soldiers. supervising ongoing intelligence support in the company. 1-80. specific products sent and received from the battalion should be coordinated in the battalion coist sops. team members 1-81. soldiers in coist complete most of the coist duties. although they may not have attended the allsource intelligence analyst training at the intelligence center of excellence, analysts are trained to accomplish analyst functions. team members are responsible for reading, interpreting, researching, and analyzing all available information on the company ao or other information that may affect company operations. coist. 1-82. the primary duties of the team members include — receiving and processing incoming reports and messages. assisting in

intelligence analyst tasks are also performed by members of the coist when formed by the company commander. facilitate company commanders situational understanding and visualization 1-85. the analyst supports company situation development by collecting and processing information collected from missions. the intelligence analyst is responsible for logging and plotting significant activities (sigacts) and initial reports that may become official sigacts. coists may also present patrol prebriefs and debriefs while performing initial analysis on information to develop intelligence. the analyst focuses on collecting the information, initial analysis for the company-specific ao, transmitting the analysis to the battalion, and updating company products. the subordinate tasks are — assist in developing company requirements —translates the battalion information collection tasks into company requirement recommendations to the commander. company requirements answer general questions that allow commanders to successfully accomplish their missions. perform ipb for company operations —receives ipb products from the battalion and refines the products to satisfy company

(refer to adp 3-90 for more information.) surprise 2-3. commanders achieve surprise by striking the enemy at a time or place, or in a manner, for which he is unprepared, by assess ing the enemy commander’s intent and denying that commander the ability to gain situational understanding. the company then capitalizes on information gained through action by maneuvering forces to critical locations on the battlefield to limit the enemy’s ability to react. concentration 2-4. concentration is the massing of overwhelming effects of the combined arms team to achieve a single purpose. the company commander must avoid set patterns or obvious movements that would indicate the timing or direction of the attack. he designates, sustains, and shifts the main effort as necessary. an enhanced digital communications and information system found at the company level facilitates the ability to concentrate combat power in a synchronized manner against the enemy quickly. tempo 2-5. tempo is a combination of speed and mass that creates pressure on the enemy. commanders build the appropriate tempo to provide the necessary momentum for attacks to achieve their objectives. 2-6. controlling or altering tempo, deliberate or rapid, is necessary to retain the initiative. at the tactical level, a rapid tempo focuses on key pieces of information, terrain, entails a small number of tasks, and allows attackers to quickly penetrate barriers and defenses and destroy enemy forces in depth before they can react. chapter 2 2-2 atp 3-21.11 4 february 20162-7. commanders adjust the tempo to achieve synchronization. speed is preferred in order to keep the enemy off balance, but establishing the conditions for decisive actions may require the tempo to be slowed as the pieces are set in place. once ready, the tempo is increased, and the action takes place rapidly. audacity 2-8. audacity is achieved by boldly executing a simple plan of action. commanders must exercise audacity by developing bold, inventive plans that produce decisive results while violently applying combat power. commanders understand when and where to take risks, avoid hesitation when executing their plan in order to seize, retain, or exploit the initiative. offensive tasks 2-9. an offensive task is a task conducted to defeat and destroy enemy forces and seize terrain, resources, and population centers (adrp 3-0). the four primary offensive tasks are movement to contact, attack, exploitation, and pursuit. the sbct infantry rifle company can participate in an exploitation or pursuit as part of a larger force by conducting movement to contact or attack as part brigade and higher echelon formations. (refer to fm 3-90-1 for more information.) sequence of the offense 2-10. this chapter discusses executing movement to contact and attack offensive tasks using the following methodology: gain and maintain enemy contact. disrupt the enemy. fix the enemy. maneuver. follow through. 2-11. this methodology is for discussion purposes only and is not the only way of conducting these offensive tasks. the methodology used to illustrate the execution of offensive tasks actually tends to overlap each other during the conduct of offense. normally the first three are shaping operations, while maneuver is the decisive operation. follow through is a sequel or a branch to the plan based on the current situation. forms of contact 2-12. in both offensive and defensive tasks, contact occurs when a member of the sbct infantry rifle company encounters a situation that requires a lethal or nonlethal response. these situations may entail one or more of the following forms of contact: (refer to fm 3-20.96 for more information.) visual. direct fire. indirect fire. obstacles. aerial. cbrn. electronic warfare (ew ). nonhostile. adversary. supporters. neutrals. offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-3 actions on contact 2-13. the sbct infantry rifle company should execute actions on contact using a logical, well-organized process of decision making and action that entails the following four steps: (refer to fm 3-90-1 for more information.) deploy and report. evaluate and develop the situation and coa . choose a coa. execute the selected coa. 2-14. this four-step process, with some steps often conducted simultaneously, is not intended to generate a rigid, lockstep response to the enemy. rather, the goal is to provide an orderly framework that enables the sbct infantry rifle company and its platoons to survive the initial contact, and then apply sound decision making and timely actions to complete the operation. ideally, the company sees the enemy (visual contact) before being seen by the enemy; it then can initiate physical contact on its own terms by executing the designated coa. 2-15. once the lead elements of a force encounter the enemy, they conduct actions on contact. the unit treats obstacles like enemy contact, as it assumes that the obstacles are covered by fire. the unit’s security force gains tactical advantage over an enemy force by using tempo and initiative to conduct actions on contact. doing so allows the unit to gain and maintain contact without becoming decisively engaged. how quickly the unit develops the situation is directly related to its security. this tempo is directly related to the unit's use of well-rehearsed sops and drills. 2-16. commanders understand that properly executed actions on contact require time at both platoon and company levels. to develop the situation fully, a platoon or company may have to execute flanking movement; conduct reconnaissance; or call for and adjust indirect fires. each of these activities requires time. the commander balances the time required for subordinate elements to conduct actions on contact with the need of the company or battalion to maintain momentum. deploy and report 2-17. events that occur during initial contact depend on whether the contact is expected or unexpected. the first step of actions on contact concludes with the unit deployed, the enemy suppressed or destroyed, and the commander sending a contact report to battalion headquarters. the following paragraphs examine some variables the company commander faces in both contact situations. expected contact 2-18. if the commander expects contact (based on reports through his own reconnaissance or through other means), he will already have deployed the company by transitioning to the bounding overwatch movement technique. if the company is alert to the likely presence of the enemy, it has a better chance of establishing first visual contact and then physical contact on its own terms. contact, either visual or physical, usually is made by an overwatching or bounding platoon, which initiates the company’s actions on contact. in a worst-case scenario, a previously undetected (but expected) enemy element may engage the platoon. the platoon in contact would conduct a battle drill for its own survival and then initiate actions on contact. unexpected contact 2-19. in some cases, the sbct infantry rifle company makes unexpected contact with the enemy while using traveling or traveling overwatch. the element in contact or, if necessary, the entire company may deploy using battle drills to survive the initial contact. when making unexpected contact, the platoon in contact immediately sends a contact report. the most efficient way for the battalion s-2 to provide situational understanding and cop to the battalion is through digital reports sent by platoons in contact. the sbct infantry rifle company and platoons develop sops that harness the capabilities of fbcb2 while destroying the enemy force and protecting the company. evaluate and develop the situation 2-20. the commander evaluates the situation and continues to develop it while the sbct infantry rifle company deploys. the commander quickly gathers as much combat information as possible, either visually chapter 2 2-4 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016or more often, through reports of the platoon(s) in contact. he analyzes the intelligence to determine critical operational considerations, to include the following: the size of the enemy element. location, composition, activity, and orientation of the enemy force. the impact of obstacles and terrain. enemy capabilities. probable enemy intentions. how to gain positional advantage over the enemy. the friendly situation (location, strength, and capabilities). possible friendly coas to achieve the specified end state. 2-21. the sbct infantry rifle company commander sends a report to battalion once he determines the size of the enemy force the company has encountered. however, after evaluating the situation, the commander may discover that he does not have enough intelligence to identify the necessary operational considerations. to make this determination, he further develops the situation according to the battalion commander’s intent, using a combination of the following capabilities: reconnaissance; employing sbct infantry squads, mgs, sniper; and using other optic s. maneuver (this includes flanking maneuver to gain additional intelligence by viewing the enemy from another perspective). indirect fire. reconnaissance by fire. unmanned aircraft system (uas). choose a course of action 2-22. after developing the situation and determining that he has enough intelligence to make a decision, the company commander selects a coa that meets the requirements of the battalion commander’s intent and is within the company’s capabilities. execute the selected course of action 2-23. the company transitions to maneuver when executing a coa. it continues to maneuver throughout execution, either as part of a tactical task or to advance while in contact to reach the point in the ao from which it executes its tactical task. the company can employ a number of tactical tasks as coas, any of which may be preceded (or followed) by additional maneuver. some of these tasks are as follows: attack by fire. breach. bypass. clear. control. disengagement. exfiltrate. follow and assume. follow and support. occupy. retain. secure. seize. support by fire. 2-24. more intelligence becomes available to the company commander as execution continues. the commander may have to alter his coa during execution based on the emerging details of the enemy situation. (for example, as the sbct infantry rifle company maneuvers to destroy what appears to be an infantry platoon, it discovers two additional platoons in prepared positions.) the commander analyzes and offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-5 develops the new situation. he selects an alternate coa, such as establishing a support by fire (sbf) position to support another company’s maneuver against the newly discovered enemy force. recommend a course of action to the higher commander 2-25. once the company commander selects a coa, keeping in mind the commander’s intent, he informs the battalion commander, who has the option of disapproving it based on its impact on the overall mission. unit sop may provide automatic approval of certain actions to avoid delay. forms of maneuver 2-26. the commander selects the form of maneuver based on his analysis of mett-tc . the commander then synchronizes the contributions of all warfighting functions to the selected form of maneuver. an operation may contain several forms of off ensive maneuver. (refer to fm 3-90-1 for more information.) t he six forms of maneuver are as follows: envelopment. flank attack. turning movement. frontal attack. penetration. infiltration. envelopment 2-27. envelopment is a form of maneuver in which an attacking force seeks to avoid the principal enemy defenses by seizing objectives behind those defenses that allow the targeted enemy force to be destroyed in their established positions (fm 3-90-1). at the tactical level, envelopments reemphasize on seizing terrain, destroying specific enemy forces, and interdicting enemy withdrawal routes. the commander’s decisive operation focuses on attacking an assailable flank. for example, an mgs platoon fixes an enemy element to allow a stryker infantry platoon to maneuver to a position of advantage at the flank or rear of the enemy, thus allowing the infantry to dismount and assault the objective from a position of advantage. it avoids the enemy’s strength— his front —where the effects of his fires and obstacles are the greatest. the commander conducts an envelopment instead of a penetration or a frontal attack in order to preserve the attacking force by potentially having fewer casualties while having the most opportunity to destroy the enemy. envelopment also produces great psychological shock on the enemy. the attacking force creates an assailable flank if none is available. the four varieties of envelopment are single envelopment, double envelopment, encirclement, and vertical envelopment . (see figure 2-1) . chapter 2 2-6 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 legend: mgs = mobile gun system figure 2-1. envelopment flank attack 2-28. a flank attack is a form of offensive maneuver directed at the flank of an enemy force. a flank is the right or left side of a military formation and is not oriented toward the enemy. it is usually not as strong in terms of forces or fires as is the front of a military formation. a flank may be created by the attacker through the use of fires or by a successful penetration. a flanking attack is similar to an envelopment but generally conducted on a shallower axis. it is designed to defeat the enemy force while minimizing the effect of the enemy‘s frontally -oriented combat power. 2-29. sbct infantry rifle companies conduct flank attacks normally as the decisive operation directed at the flank of the enemy. they use mission command systems, mobility of their stryker vehicles, and infantry to initiate the flank attack unaware to the enemy. they capitalize on situations where speed and simplicity are the main factors and, ultimately, keeping the initiative. usually, a supporting effort engages offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-7 the enemy ’s front by fire and maneuver while the main effort maneuvers to attack the enemy ’s flank. this supporting effort diverts the enemy ’s attention from the threatened flank. 2-30. the primary difference between a flank attack and an envelopment is one of depth. a flank attack is an envelopment delivered squarely on the enemy ’s flank. conversely, an envelopment is a flank attack delivered beyond the enemy ’s flank and into their rear area, but short of the depth associated with a turning movement. smaller-size tactical units, such as maneuver battalions, companies, and platoons, are more likely to conduct flank attacks than larger tactical units. this is largely a result of troop-to -space ratios and sustainment and mission command. (see figure 2-2.) legend: mgs = mobile gun system figure 2-2. flank attack turning movement 2-31. a turning movement is a form of maneuver in which the attacking force seeks to avoid the enemy’s principle defensive positions by seizing objec tives behind the enemy’s current positions thereby causing the enemy force to move out of their current positions or divert major forces to meet the threat (fm 3-90-1) . chapter 2 2-8 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 when conducting a turning movement the attacking force avoids the enemy’s main defensiv e positions. the attacking force seizes objectives behind the enemy’s current position which causes the enemy force to move out of his current position or divert major forces to meet the threat. 2-32. the sbct infantry rifle company uses information sharing through mission command systems with the mobility of the stryker platform to maneuver in order to seize vital areas in the enemy’s support area before the main enemy force can withdraw or receive support or reinforcements. a turning movement differs from envelopment because the force conducting a turning movement seeks to make the enemy force displace from their current locations. an enveloping force seeks to engage the enemy in their established location from an unexpected direction. (see figure 2-3.) lege nd: mgs = mobile gun system, obj = objective figure 2-3. turning movement frontal attack 2-33. in a frontal attack the attacking force destroys a weaker enemy or fixes a larger enemy force in place over a broad front ( fm 3-90-1 ). offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-9 2-34. an attacking force can use a frontal attack to rapidly overrun a weak enemy force. the stryker infantry rifle company uses a frontal attack with its infantry their icvs, mgs, and mortars providing support by fire. (see figure 2-4.) legend: mgs = mobile gun system figure 2-4. frontal attack penetration 2-35. a penetration is a form of maneuver in which an attacking force seeks to rupture enemy defenses on a narrow front to disrupt the defensive system (fm 3-90-1). the penetration extends from the enemy’s main defensive positions through the security area into the enemy support area. the stryker infantry rifle company commander employs a penetration when there is no assailable flank, enemy defenses are overextended and weak spots are detected in the enemy’s positions , or time pressures do not permit envelopment. they use fires and effects to support maneuvering units. (see figure 2-5.) chapter 2 2-10 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 legend: flot = forward line of troops, obj = objective, pl = phase line figure 2-5. penetration infiltration 2-36. an infiltration is a form of maneuver in which an attacking force conducts undetected movement through or into an area occupied by enemy forces to occupy a position of advantage behind those enemy positions while exposing only small elements to enemy defensive fires (fm 3-90-1). infiltration occurs by land, water, air, or a combination of means. moving and assembling forces covertly through enemy positions is time consuming. t o infiltrate successfully, the force avoids detection and engagement. since this requirement limits the size and strength of the infiltrating force —and infiltrated forces alone can rarely defeat an enemy —infiltration is normally used in conjunction with and in support of other forms of maneuver. common offensive planning considerations 2-37. the warfighting functions are critical tactical activities the commander can use to review, prepare, and execute planning. synchronization and coordination between the warfighting functions are critical for offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-11 success. the following paragraphs discuss selected warfighting functions and other additional planning considerations. warfighting functions 2-38. the warfighting functions outlines the planning consideration for offense. mission command 2-39. the commander’s mission and intent determine t he scheme of maneuver and the allocation of available resources. all planning for offensive tasks address the mission variables of mett-tc. the mission command function of offensive tasks for the stryker infantry rifle company include: commander’s intent. mission objectives, to include task and purpose, for each subordinate element. scheme of maneuver. location of key leaders. suspected enemy locations and courses of action. courses of action. required control measures/graphics. priorities of fire. bypass criteria. reporting requirements. primary, alternate, contingency, and emergency (pace) communications. movement and maneuver 2-40. the commander conducts maneuver to avoid enemy strengths and to create opportunities to increase the effects of friendly fires. the commander achieves surprise by making unexpected maneuvers, rapidly changing the tempo of ongoing missions, avoiding observation, and using deceptive techniques and procedures. the commander seeks to overwhelm the enemy with one or more unexpected actions before the enemy has time to react in an organized fashion. this happens when the company or force conducting the attack is able to attack the enemy from a position of strength or from an unexpected location or direction. the stryker infantry rifle company does this. by dismounting at a predetermined point. the stryker vehicle is designed to be used as an infantry carrier vehicle for transporting soldiers safely and more rapidly. the vehicle has the ability to support the infantry platoon while dismounted. formations 2-41. the company commander selects what formation and order of units to deploy his forces based on the factors of mett-tc. each formation provides the commander with flexibility to achieve a specific outcome. commanders can shift formations as needed as factors of mett-tc change to maintain the initiative. 2-42. mounted formation selection for the sbct infantry rifle company commander occurs from point of departure until the lead element reaches its dismount point or makes contact and deploys its forces. the company rapidly shifts to a combination of mounted and dismounted elements working to complement each other’s maneuver. mett-tc will impact the decision making of subordinate leaders to select formations that optimally support their maneuver. the compa ny commander’s role is to coordinate the maneuver of its subordinate forces to synchronize their maneuver and formation to accomplish to overall mission. column 2-43. the column formation allows the company to make contact with one platoon and maneuver with the two trail platoons. it is a flexible formation, allowing easy transition to other formations. it provides good all-around security and allows fast movement. it provides good dispersion and aids maneuver and control, especially in limited visibility. the company can deliver a limited volume of fire to the front and to the rear, and a high volume to the flanks. (see figure 2-6.) chapter 2 2-12 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 legend: cdr = commander, fist = fire integration support team, mgs = mobile gun system, mtr = mortar, xo = executive officer figure 2-6. company column with platoons in a wedge and in columns company wedge 2-44. the company wedge formation allows the commander to make contact with a small element and still maneuver the remaining platoons. if the company is engaged from the flank, one platoon is free to maneuver. this formation is hard to control, but it allows faster movement than the company vee formation. (see figure 2-7 on -13.) offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-13 legend: cdr = commander, fist = fire integration support team, mgs = mobile gun system, mtrs = mortars, xo = executive officer figure 2-7. company in wedge with platoons in different formations company vee 2-45. the company vee formation has two platoons forward to provide immediate fire on contact or to flank the enemy. it has one platoon centered trailing the two forward platoons. if the company is engaged from either flank, two platoons can provide fire, and at least one platoon is free to maneuver. this formation is hard to control and slows movement. the company commander designates one of the forward platoons as the base platoon. (see figure 2-8.) chapter 2 2-14 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 legend: cdr = commander, fist = fire integration support team, mgs = mobile gun system, mtrs = mortars, xo = executive officer figure 2-8. company vee with platoons in different formations company line 2-46. the company line formation puts all platoons forward along the same direction of movement, and it provides for the delivery of maximum fire to the front, but less to the flanks. it is the most difficult formation to control. the company commander designates a base platoon, normally the center one, for the others to guide on. flank and rear security is generally poor, but is improved when the flank platoons use echelon formations. (see figure 2-9 on -15.) offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-15 legend: cdr = commander, fist = fire integration support team, mgs = mobile gun system, xo = executive officer figure 2-9. company line with platoons in wedge formations echelon right or left 2-47. the echelon right or echelon left formation is used if the situation is vague and the company commander anticipates enemy contact to the front or on one of the flanks. normally, an obstacle or another friendly unit exists on the flank of the company opposite the echeloned flank, preventing enemy contact on that side. this formation provides a good volume of fire and protection to the echeloned flank, but less to the opposite flank. (see figure 2-10.) legend: cdr = commander, fist = fire integration support team, mgs = mobile gun system, mtrs = mortars, xo = executive officer figure 2-10. company echelon right with platoons in echelon formations chapter 2 2-16 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 box and diamond 2-48. the box information is useful when general information about the enemy is known, and the sbct infantry rifle company requires flexibility and depth in its attack. the diamond formation is a variation of the box formation. the sbct infantry rifle company uses box and diamond formations (see figure 2-11) when it has four maneuver forces. both the box and the diamond formations — provide the best flexibility for maneuver. enable easy transition into all other formations. distribute firepower forward and to the flanks. are easy to control. provide all-around security. facilitate rapid movement. provide protection of accompanying maneuver enhancement and sustainment elements located in the center of the formation. legend: cdr = commander, fist = fire integration support team, mgs = mobile gun system, mtr = mortar, xo = executive officer figure 2-11. sbct infantry rifle company box and diamond formations formation selection 2-49. the company commander selects the formation that provides the proper control, security, and speed. table 2-1 on -17 compares the movement formations. offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-17 table 2-1. comparison of movement formations formation security fires control speed column good dispersion good all -round security good to front and rear excellent to the flanks easy to control flexible formation fast line excellent to the front poor to the flank and rear excellent to the front poor to the flank and rear difficult to control inflexible formation slow wedge good all -round security good to the front and flanks less difficult to control than the line flexible formation faster than the line vee better to the front very good to the front very difficult to control slow echelon good to the echeloned flank and front good t o the echeloned flank and front difficult to control slow box good dispersion good all -round security very good to front and rear very good to the flanks easy to control flexible formation diamond good dispersion good all -round security very good to fro nt and rear very good to the flanks easy to control flexible formation file least secure effective use of concealment poor easy to control fast 2-50. combat formations allow a unit to move in the ao in a posture suited to the senior commander’s intent and mission. a unit may employ a series of combat formations during the course of an attack; each has its advantages and disadvantages. subordinate units within a combat formation can employ their own combat formations consistent with their particular situation. the commander considers the advantages and disadvantages of each formation with both mounted and dismounted elements in the areas of leading, influencing, maintenance, firepower orientation, ability to mass fires, and flexibility when determining the appropriate formation for a given situation. movement techniques 2-51. all combat formations use one or more of the three movement techniques which are traveling, traveling overwatch, or bounding overwatch ( fm 3-90-1). traveling 2-52. continuous movement characterizes the traveling technique. it is best suited for situations in which enemy contact is unlikely and speed is important. (see figure 2-12.) chapter 2 2-18 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 legend: mgs = mobile gun system figure 2-12. traveling traveling overwatch 2-53. traveling overwatch is an extended form of traveling that provides additional security when speed is desirable but contact is possible. the intent is to maintain depth, provide flexibility, and maintain the ability to maneuver if contact occurs. (see figure 2-13 on -19.) offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-19 legend: mgs = mobile gun system figure 2-13. traveling overwatch bounding overwatch 2-54. bounding overwatch is used when contact is expected. it is the most secure, but slowest, movement technique. the purpose of bounding overwatch is to deploy before contact, giving the unit the ability to protect a bounding element by immediately suppressing an enemy force. the company can employ either of two bounding methods; alternate or successive. (see figure 2-14.) 2-55. a technique to employ for the length of a bound is based on half the distance of the maximum effective range of weapon system in the overwatch element. this allows the overwatching element to cover the bounding element by allowing enough range to identify and engage a threat. the bounding element selects a covered position within that range and then becomes the overwatching element. chapter 2 2-20 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016alternate bounds 2-56. covered by the rear element, the lead element moves forward, halts, and assumes overwatch positions. the rear element advances past the lead element and takes up overwatch positions. this sequence continues, as needed, with only one element moving at a time. this method is usually more rapid than successive bounds. successive bounds 2-57. in the successive bounding method, the lead element covered by the rear element, advances and assumes overwatch positions. the rear element then advances to an overwatch position abreast of the lead element, halts, and assumes overwatch. the lead element then moves to the next position, and so on. only one element moves at a time, and the rear element avoids advancing beyond the lead element. this method is easier to control and more secure than the alternate bounding method, but it is slower. legend: mgs = mobile gun system figure 2-14 . bounding overwatch offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-21 2-58. the commander’s use of standard formations enables the unit to shift rapidly from one formation to another, giving additional flexibility when adjusting to changes in the mission variables. dismounting infantry platoons will change the pace of the operation and formations will change rapidly and often between mounted and dismounted elements. (this results from the commander rehearsing subordinates so that they can change formations using standard responses to changing situations, such as actions on contact.) by designating the combat formation planned for use, the commander — establishes the geographic relationship between units. indicates probable reactions once the enemy makes contact with the formation. indicates the level of security desired. establishes the preponderant orientation of subordinate weapons systems. postures friendly forces for the attack. 2-59. the company should try to make enemy contact with the smallest possible friendly force at terms that are favorable. this is achieved by the reconnaissance task conducted by the higher echelon to support the sbct infantry rifle c ompany’s maneuver . this allows most of the company freedom to maneuver against the enemy force. intelligence 2-60. the commander, assisted by the coist if formed, uses threat templates, the situation template, the most probable coa, the most dangerous coa, civil consideration products, terrain products, and other intelligence products to identify any aspect within the operational environment that will affect the friendly force and enemy force. this information may come from the intelligence sections from within the company, battalion, brigade, or in combination with other intelligence agency or entity. (refer to atp 2-01.3 for more information.) 2-61. the attacking unit continuously conducts information collection during the mission because it is unlikely that the commander has complete knowledge of the enemy’s intentions and actual actions but will receive constant updates from higher and adjacent units with sharing of the cop. fires 2-62. leader’s conduct fires planning concurrently with maneuver planning at all levels. brigade combat team’s (bct’s ) and sbct infantry battalions typically use top-down fire support planning, with bottom-up refinement of the plans. as part of the top-down fire planning system, the battalion includes a fires annex with its opord. the company commander refines the fire plan from higher headquarters to meet his mission requirements and to ensure that these refinements are incorporated into the higher headquarters ’ plan. 2-63. a clearly defined concept of operations enables the company commander to articulate precisely how he wants indirect fires to affect the enemy during the different phases of the operation. this allows the sbct infantry rifle company fso to develop a fire support plan that supports the sbct infantry rifle company’s mission. he has the ability to plan an echelon of fires with access to company mortars using 60mm dismounted, or 120-mm mounted. it allows the mortar section sergeant to develop their scheme of maneuver and place mortar firing positions. the company can possibly use battalion mortars 120-mm and 81-mm, fires from the field artillery battalion using 155-mm howitzers, and use of cas and close combat attack (cca). to develop an effective fires plan, the company fso understands the commander’s intent to conduct the fire planning process and address all the essential elements of a fire support plan. sustainment 2-64. the objective of sustainment in offensive tasks is to ensure the tactical commander maintains the momentum. the commander wants to take advantage of windows of opportunity and launch offensive tasks with minimum advance warning. therefore, sustainment planners, and operators anticipate these events and maintain the flexibility to support the offensive plan. a key to successful offensive tasks is the ability to anticipate the requirement to push support forward, specifically regarding ammunition, fuel, and water. the 1sg supervising the supply sergeant requests classes of supply packages that are designed specifically to the company. planning rates of future consumption will need to be factored when the company coordinates its resupply at a specific time and location. all stryker vehicles and personnel can carry up to 72 hours of chapter 2 2-22 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016supply and conduct resupply to carry that capacity when necessary. (see chapter 8 , sustainment, for more information.) logistics 2-65. sustainment maintains momentum of the attack by delivering supplies as far forward as possible. in order for the sbct infantry rifle company to get their required supplies it may require them to send combat power elements to provide security for the transport of supplies and logistics packages to their company for emergency situations or operations beyond 72 hours. the commander can use throughput distribution and preplanned and preconfigured packages of essential items to help maintain offensive momentum and tempo. the xo and 1sg ensure that the supply packages are arranged according to the company commander’s plan. health service support 2-66. the burden on medical resources increases due to the intensity of offensive tasks and the increased distances as the force advances. the commander reallocates medical resources as the tactical situation changes. the 1sg and emergency care sergeant advise the commander to enhance the company’s responsive and effective health service support. protection 2-67. the rapid tempo and changing nature of offensive tasks present challenges when protecting friendly assets. the forward movement of subordinate units is critical if the commander is to maintain the initiative necessary for successful offensive tasks. denying the enemy a chance to plan, prepare, and execute an effective response to friendly offensive tasks through maintaining a high operational tempo is a key means the commander employs to ensure the survivability of his force. maintaining a high tempo of offensive tasks includes using multiple routes; dispersion; highly mobile forces; piecemeal destruction of isolated enemy forces; scheduled rotation and relief of forces before they culminate; keeping an infantry team with the vehicles for local security; and wise use of terrain. the exact techniques employed in a situation reflect the mission variables. 2-68. the commander protects subordinate forces to deny the enemy the capability of interfering with ongoing missions. that protection meets the commander’s legal and moral obligations to the organization’s soldiers. to help protect the force, the commander addresses all protection tasks during the unit’s planning, preparation, and execution, while he assesses the effectiveness of those protection tasks. some of these protection assets will need to be requested from higher headquarters. (refer to fm 3-90-1 and adrp 3-37 for more information.) additional planning considerations 2-69. additional offensive task planning considerations include the following: urban environment. mountainous terrain. desert environment. jungle environment. subsurface areas. sniper employment considerations. air assault operations. urba n environment 2-70. offensive tasks in an urban environment aim to destroy, defeat, or neutralize an enemy force. however, the purpose may be to achieve some effect relating to the population or infrastructure of the urban area. no matter the purpose, commanders should use a combined arms approach for successful offense. offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-23 2-71. stryker infantry rifle company has a significant advantage in the urban environment during offensive tasks with its force structure, technology, firepower, and protection. the force structure allows it to place infantry squads into an urban area that can maneuver, communicate , and interact in close contact with the local population, and search. it has the firepower to be able to organically conduct dynamic building breaches using mgs or demolition charges if rules of engagement (roe) allow; suppress or destroy significant fortified emplacements with the use of .50cals, mk-19s or the mgs; and infiltrate snipers to provide long range precision fires or surveillance. the vehicles themselves provide protection with their armor and can engage enemy safely and accurately with the use of the remote weapon station. mountainous terrain 2-72. combat in mountainous terrain presents units with complicated and ever-shifting hazards, difficulties, opportunities, and risks. mountain combat calls for extreme physical fitness, mental toughness, endurance, and the utmost in tactical and technical proficiency on the part of all individuals. a disciplined and prepared sbct infantry rifle company that is task-organized with and supported by the other members of the combined arms team facilitates success. a unit fighting in the mountains overcomes difficulties, measures risks, and exploits opportunities to close with the enemy and defeat him. well prepared commanders anticipate, understand, and adapt to the physical demands of mountain environments. they face and overcome the challenges of fighting in areas where technological supremacy can be negated by even the most crude and nontechnical enemy actions. leaders should prepare for mountain missions in a manner that allows their units to adapt to the challenges. (refer to attp 3-21.50 for more information.) 2-73. sbct infantry companies conducting offensive, defensive, and stability tasks in mountainous terrain are able to adapt and skillfully use the environmental challenges to their advantage. the design of the landscape, coupled with climatic conditions, creates a unique set of characteristics in mountainous terrain that are described below. close fights with infantry 2-74. mountain combat is close as the opposing forces meet in the rugged terrain. even though engaging targets near the limits of direct fire weapons does occur in mountain engagements, intervening crests, hills, ridges, gullies, depressions, and other terrain features often limit long range engagements with the enemy. the upper levels of mountainous terrain are characterized by a lack of trafficable roads. dismounted units execute the mission when use of motorized vehicles is restricted. the sbct infantry rifle company soldiers can use organic air burst munitions that can set conditions to fix or maneuver against the enemy that are behind defilade or in dead space where direct fire weapons have little effect. decentralized small-unit operations 2-75. mountainous terrain environments do not support the meeting and maneuver of large units requiring conflicts to be fought at the platoon and squad level. mountainous terrain can separate brigades from battalions, battalions from companies, and companies from platoons for long periods. communication with higher and adjacent units can be difficult at times. contingencies for establishing pace communications should be established. intent based operations should be clearly communicated to allow platoon and squad level leaders to take actions according to the commander’s intent in case communications cannot be maintained. degraded mobility and increased movement times 2-76. the ruggedness of mountainous terrain may restrict mobility to foot movements using file type formations on roads and trails. a relatively short distance from point to point may be an arduous movement over steep, rocky, uneven terrain, with multiple trail switchbacks that increase the distance traveled and the energy expended to traverse it. in mountainous terrain, the infantry dismount to move through defiles, choke points, and other restricted terrain at higher or lower elevations. this allows the stryker vehicles to carry the majority of the infantry’s equipment and sustainment needs to lessen the combat load weight. periodic link up points should be planned along traveled routes to resupply the dismounted force. unique sustainment techniques 2-77. sustainment in a mountainous terrain is a challenging and time-consuming process. terrain and weather complicate sustainment tasks to include logistics resupply, medical evacuation, casevac, and chapter 2 2-24 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 soldier health and hygiene. the network of restrictive mountain roads rarely supports resupply vehicles with a large turning radius, or two-way traffic. often, vehicle traffic can use more terrain favorable routes at lower elevations along the base of mountains and through rivers and streams. movement of supplies includes air, vehicle, foot, and animal. each technique has its own challenges in mountainous terrain. operations in thinly populated areas 2-78. the populace that reside in mountainous terrain live in small villages in the valleys with some scattered villages in the upper mountain areas. although the farmers and animal herders that are most of the indigenous population may work in the mountains, the vast amount of mountainous terrain remains unpopulated. 2-79. mountainous terrain and weather conditions can be both an advantage and a disadvantage to friendly or enemy forces. if unprepared, the terrain can be a company's adversary. personnel prepare mentally and physically, and leaders prepare tactically and logistically to conduct missions in the mountains. company leaders understand physical characteristics of mountainous terrain and how to use terrain and weather to their advantage. mountainous terrain is characterized by one or more of the following: high altitudes. gently rolling slopes and steep cliffs. varying amounts of vegetation (heavy, light, or none). timberline. rocky ground. wet or dry stream beds. glaciated peaks. compartmentalization. mountain weather is characterized by the following: extreme conditions (such as scorching hot, subfreezing, violent thunderstorms, and blizzards). large temperature differences between day and night. sudden atmospheric disturbances. offensive tasks in mountainous terrain 2-80. determining where the enemy is located or suspected to be is a key factor when conducting offensive tasks in mountainous terrain. it is extremely difficult to target the enemy in rugged mountainous terrain with physical characteristics such as caves, rock formations, depressions, rifts, and wooded areas. these offer excellent cover and concealment to infantry or paramilitary forces within a dispersed area. the second factor is determining an appropriate method to fix or place the enemy in a kill zone where they can be attacked without escaping. 2-81. the mountainous, restrictive terrain drives most offensive combat tasks to dismounted movements with smaller elements. correspondingly, tasks tend to become more decentralized and take place at the platoon and squad level. junior leadership initiative and decisiveness is essential during the conduct of these tasks. 2-82. leaders plan offensive engagements on favorable terms to the attacking force. as with all offensive tasks, the initiative is with the attacker. the attacker chooses the time, place, and method of attack, while the defender considers all possible methods of attack and avenues of attack. units can execute effective attacks in the mountains with careful planning and preparation. understanding the enemy and how they use mountainous terrain and weather to their advantage is crucial to developing a scheme of maneuver. reconnaissance will be limited in gaining timely information because the terrain offers cover and concealment from visual contact and limits signal signatures for both forces. establishment long duration observations posts (ops) equipped with enhanced optics from points overwatching likely routes can mitigate some of the lack of information. it is beneficial when creating clear, tactical tasks for mission command, time, and additional combat power to support the mission. leaders who understand enemy mountain tactics are able to use the same mountain characteristics to their advantage. (refer to attp 3-21.50 for more information .) offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-25 desert e nvironment 2-83. successful desert operations require adaptation to the environment and to the terrain and climate limitations. equipment and tactics must be modified and adapted to a dusty and rugged landscape with extremes in temperature and where visibility may change from 30 miles to 30 feet in a matter of minutes. (refer to fm 90-3 for more information.) stryker units often lack the range advantage with mtoe weapon systems to engage targets identified with their sensors. they rely on indirect fires, cas and cca, antitank guided missile (atgm) and mgs to mitigate. the stryker vehicle is also vulnerable in open desert usually when moving and relies on the terrain for protection by utilizing covered positions in restricted terrain. bounding overwatch should be considered as more prevalent movement technique when the enemy force has armored forces or armor defeating weapon systems with long ranges. jungle e nvironment 2-84. successful offensive tasks in a jungle environment combine dispersion and concentration. for example, a force may move out in a dispersed formation so that it can find the enemy. once contact is made, its subordinate forces close on the enemy from all directions. operations are enemy-oriented, not terrain-oriented. wherever the enemy is found, that is where he should be destroyed. if he is allowed to escape, he will only have to be found again, with all the risks involved. (refer to fm 90-5 for more information.) subsurface areas 2-85. a subsurface area is a condition that can be found on all four of the operational environments. subsurface areas are areas below ground level that may consist of underground facilities, passages, subway lines, utility tunnels, sewers, and storm drains, caves, or other subterranean spaces. these areas can be used for cover and concealment, troop movement, command and control functions, and engagements, but their use requires intimate knowledge of the area. knowledge of the nature and location of these subsurface areas is of great value to both friendly and enemy forces. to exploit the advantages of subsurface areas, a thorough reconnaissance is required. maximizing the use of these areas could prove to be a decisive factor while conducting offensive operations. sniper employment 2-86. snipers are organic to the sbct infantry rifle company. snipers and observers play a critical role in infantry company operations. well-trained snipers provide the commander accurate, discriminating, longrange small-arms fire, and direct observation of key terrain and avenues of approach. the two best uses of sniper fire or long-range precision fire are against key targets beyond the range of organic rifles and automatic weapons, or against any targets that other weapon systems cannot destroy due to range, size, location, visibility, or security and stealth requirements. sniper ttp enables them to directly gather and relay critical, detailed enemy information. sniper effectiveness is measured by more than casualties or destroyed targets. commanders know snipers affect enemy activities, morale, and decisions. knowing snipers are present hinders the enemy ’s movement, and creates confusion and continuous personal fear. it disrupts enemy operations and preparations, and compels the enemy to divert forces to deal with the snipers. (refer to tc 3-22.10 for more information.) 2-87. during the offense, snipers help the commander accomplish the mission by — obtaining information. depriving the enemy of resources. deceiving or diverting the enemy from the main effort. keeping the enemy from regrouping or repositioning. conducting preemptive attacks to gain the initiative. disrupting enemy offensive actions. 2-88. during the conduct of offensive tasks, snipers infiltrate enemy areas and engage them from unexpected directions. the teams should move out well in advance of the projected movement. this allows them to move at their own pace so they remain undetected. it also allows them to engage any targets that threaten the advance. the teams may use normal stalking methods, or they can be inserted by ground vehicle, helicopter, parachutes, or boats. their precision fire reduces delays during the hasty attack. chapter 2 2-26 atp 3-21.11 4 february 20162-89. in a deliberate attack, snipers can be effectively employed near the fire support element. their accuracy and optics enable them to reduce enemy targets in the midst of friendly forces. during a deliberate attack, the unit should take care to avoid drawing enemy attention to the sniper team’s position. the team may be deployed forward of the fire support (fs) element to support the attack, with accurate selective rifle fire, or deployed with a cutoff force with the same task. they infiltrate behind the enemy positions to disrupt counterattacks or withdrawal and to harass enemy reinforcements if time permits. (refer to tc 3-22.10 for more information.) air assault 2-90. the stryker infantry rifle company participates in air assault operations as part of an air assault task force (aatf), led by a battalion headquarters or higher. when the mission variables of mett-tc require infantry soldiers to conduct offensive tasks beyond the capabilities of their stryker vehicles. this occurs when speed and difficult terrain are factors. air assault operations can be conducted by purely infantry or in conjunction with another stryker mounted element. 2-91. air assaults operations should not be employed in roles requiring deliberate operations over an extended period of time, and is best employed in situations that provide a calculated advantage due to surprise, terrain, threat, or mobility. in particular air assault operations are conducted when — massing or shifting combat power quickly. using surprise. using flexibility, mobility, and speed. gaining and maintaining the initiative. 2-92. the following are basic planning considerations for the sbct infantry rifle company when participating in air assault operations: air assault operations are best conducted at night or during weather conditions that allow aircraft operation, but obscure enemy observation to facilitate deception and surprise. fire support planning provides suppressive fires along air routes and in the vicinity of lzs. priority for fires should be to the suppression of enemy air defense (sead) systems. upon landing the ground force is responsible for identifying and marking targets. the initial assault force requires enough combat power to seize the lz upon landing, establish air control over the lz, and conduct clearance of fires as part of the air-ground operations. the lz control makes the decision for landing follow on forces based upon established criteria developed during planning or discovered during execution. contingency plan to respond to downed aircraft. infantry unit operations are not fundamentally changed by integrating with aviation units. however, tempo and distance are dramatically changed. vulnerabilities 2-93. an aatf uses helicopters to move to and close with the enemy. initial assault elements should minimize the amount of equipment and the number of personnel to assure mobility. they are often separated from weapon systems, equipment, and materiel that provide protection and survivability on the area of operation. (refer to fm 3-99 for more information.) an aatf is particularly vulnerable to enemy — attack by aircraft and air defense weapon systems during the movement phase. attack by cbrn weapons because of limited cbrn protection and decontamination capability. attack by ground, air, or artillery during the loading and landing phases. air strikes due to limited availability of air defense weapon system s. electronic attack, to include jamming of communications and navigation systems, and disrupting aircraft survivability equipment. small-arms fire which presents a large threat to helicopters during the air movement and landing phases. offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-27 section ii – moveme nt to contact 2-94. movement to contact is an offensive task designed to develop the situation and establish or regain contact (adrp 3-90). when necessary, the sbct infantry rifle company can conduct this task regardless of which decisive action element is currently predominate —offense, defense, or stability. units plan and conduct movement to contact to gain or regain contact with the enemy. it ends when they make enemy contact. the company usually conducts a movement to contact as part of an sbct infantry battalion or larger element. based on mission variables, the sbct infantry rifle company may conduct the task independently. movement to contact includes search and attack and cordon and search. 2-95. purposeful and aggressive movement, decentralized control, and the hasty deployment of formations from the march to conduct offensive, defensive, or stability tasks characterize a movement to contact. the fundamentals of an movement to contact are as follows: focus all efforts on finding the enemy. make initial contact with small, mobile, self-contained forces to avoid decisive engagement of the main body on ground chosen by the enemy. this allows the commander maximum flexibility to develop the situation. task-organize the force and use movement formations to deploy and attack rapidly in any direction. keep subordinate forces within supporting distances to facilitate a flexible response. maintain contact regardless of the coa adopted once contact is gained. organization of forces 2-96. the sbct infantry rifle company organizes for a movement to contact with a forward security force and a main body. a portion of the main body composes the commander’s sustaining base. based on the mission variables of mett-tc, the battalion commander may increase the sbct infantry rifle c ompany’s security force by attaching the scout platoon. this usually happens when the sbct infantry battalion is conducting a movement to contact and the sbct infantry rifle company is the advance guard for the battalion. the security force for the company can be an infantry rifle platoon, mgs platoon, or battalion scout platoon if attached or combination of any of these elements. snipers can also be assigned to this element to provide assistance. security force 2-97. a security force is comprised of four elements; covering force, advance guard, flank guard, and rea r guard. for the sbct infantry rifle company its covering force and advance guard are normally the same element and normally one of its sbct infantry rifle platoons. covering force 2-98. normally the lead squad of the infantry rifle platoon will serve as a covering force providing early warning allowing the sbct infantry rifle platoon following as the advance guard fix the enemy force when it makes contact. 2-99. the primary advantage to having a covering force is the early and accurate reporting about the enemy and terrain. this force must be prepared to fight for information against an enemy. depth is essential to providing early warning and reaction time for leaders at the platoon, company, and battalion levels. it enables leaders to conduct actions on contact that preserve the parent unit’s freedom of movement and maneuver. this security element is normally the unit’s initial main effort. advance guard 2-100. the purpose of the sbct infantry rifle platoon or company, when it is serving as the advance guard of a larger force, is to protect the main body from surprise attack, develop the situation to protect the deployment of the main body, and fix the enemy’s main body. the advance guard’s responsibilities include the following: provide security and early warning for the main body and facilitate its uninterrupted advance. chapter 2 2-28 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016conduct reconnaissance to locate enemy forces along the battalion’s axis of ad vance. conduct actions on contact to retain freedom of maneuver for the battalion. call for indirect fires to impede or harass the enemy. destroy enemy reconnaissance elements. find, fix, or contain enemy main body to retain freedom of maneuver for the battalion. bypass and report obstacles or act as the battalion support or breach force during breaching operations. 2-101. the composition of the advance guard depends on mett-tc factors. in open terrain, the guard may move mounted in restricted, close, complex, or the urban environment. in severely restrictive terrain infantry maneuver with vehicles in the overwatch may be a better choice. the sbct infantry rifle company has the flexibility to accomplish this mission mounted or dismounted. 2-102. the advance guard is the battalion commander’s main effort until the main body is committed; then priority of fires shifts to the main body. each decision point (dp) should be based on the actions of the advance guard in some circumstances. flank and rear guard 2-103. platoon-size elements from one of the sbct rifle company serve as the flank guard for both the battalion and company. this is done through formation selection. normally this element conducts a moving flank screen using alternating or successive bounds with squads or section. these elements remain at a distance from the main body. flank security elements operate far enough out to prevent the enemy from surprising the main body with direct fires. 2-104. the company provides its own rear security, assisted by rapid forward movement, which gives the enemy less opportunity to react or reposition forces to attack the battalion. units plan indirect fires on major flank and approaches to enhance security. upon switching from a movement to contact to an attack, this platoon will normally conduct follow and support of the main body. main body 2-105. the combat elements of the main body are prepared to deploy and maneuver rapidly to a dp in the ao to destroy the enemy. the main body keys its movement to the advance guard. it maintains information of the advance guard’s activities via fm crosstalk or digital communication, primarily fbcb 2. the main body, remaining attuned to the advance guard’s situation, provides responsive support when the advance guard is committed. 2-106. tasks the company can perform within the main body include the following: find, fix, defeat, destroy, or contain the enemy’s main body, followed by an assault on the enemy force or initiate exploitation. execute a course of action to defeat or destroy designated enemy main body elements. 2-107. the use of standard formations and battle drills allows the battalion commander, using the information available to him through the army mission command system (amcs), to shift combat power rapidly in the ao. companies employ the appropriate movement techniques within the battalion formation. company commanders, based on their knowledge of the commander’s intent and their own sa, anticipate the battalion commander’s decisions for commitment of the main body and plan accordingly. control measures 2-108. the task usually starts from a line of departure (ld) at the time specified in the opord. the commander controls the movement to contact by using phase lines, contact points, target reference points (trps), and checkpoints as required. soldiers should be mindful of surface danger zones of their weapon systems to prevent friendly fire or collateral damage. the commander controls the depth of the movement to contact by using a limit of advance (loa) or a forward boundary. the commander could designate one or more objectives to limit the extent of the movement to contact and orient the force. however, these are often terrain-oriented and used only to guide movement. although a movement to contact may result in offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-29 taking a terrain objective, the primary focus should be on the enemy force. the commander should plan some other type of offensive action if he has enough intelligence to locate significant enemy forces. 2-109. comp any commanders use positive control over maneuver units, coupled with battle drills and formation discipline. the commander can designate a series of phase lines that can successively become the new rear boundary of the forward security elements as that force advances. each rear boundary becomes the forward boundary of the main body and shifts as the security force moves forward. the rear boundary of the main body designates the rear security element’s limit of responsibility. this line shifts as the main body moves forward. planning a movement to contact 2-110. planning a movement to contact allows for flexibility and promotes subordinate initiative. developing the concept of the operation needs to have an emphasis on ultimate control of the objective, and conducting a reverse planning sequence from the objective to the ld. this is accomplished by issuing a clear command er’s intent, developing a simple concept of operations, and developing a series of decision points to execute maneuver options. units place increased emphasis on developing an aggressive and flexible information collection effort that is linked to the comm ander’s priority intelligence requirement (pir) focusing on locating and identifying the enemy’s strength, disposition, and activities. 2-111. the commander conducts information collection tasks to determine the enemy’s location and intent while conducting security operations to protect the main body. this includes the use of available air assets, manned and unmanned. this enables the main body to focus on planning and preparation, to include rehearsals of: hasty attacks, bypass maneuvers, and hasty defenses. the plan addresses actions anticipated by the commander based on available intelligence and the conduct of meeting engagements and other anticipated battle drills. preparing for a movement to contact 2-112. the preparations for a movement to contact are the same as those for an attack. to avoid redundancy see the appropriate paragraph of section vi, attack, of this chapter for more information on this subject. executing a movement to contact 2-113. each element of the force synchronizes its actions with adjacent and supporting units, maintaining contact and coordination as prescribed in orders and unit sop. this section discusses executing a movement to contact using the sequence of the offense discussed in section ii of this chapter. gain and maintain enemy contact 2-114. the commander conducts reconnaissance by using all available information collection assets to find the enemy’s location and dispositions. sensors alone cannot confirm the exact disposition and location of all enemy forces. infantry should dismount their vehicles prior to the last known point of enemy detection. this ensures that the commander can commit friendly forces under optimal conditions. the commander uses all available sources of combat information and intelligence reports to find the enemy ’s location and dispositions. disrupt the enemy 2-115. once contact is made, the main body brings overwhelming fires onto the enemy to prevent him from conducting either a spoiling attack or organizing a coherent defense. the security force maneuvers as quickly as possible to find gaps in the enemy ’s defenses. the commander gathers as much information as possible about the enemy ’s dispositions, strengths, capabilities, and intentions. as more intelligence becomes available, the main body attacks to destroy or disrupt enemy command and control centers, fire control nodes, and communication nets. 2-116. the stryker vehicles should maneuver to positions out of enemy contact to engage repositioning enemy forces or support the dismounted force with dir ect fire, casevac, mission command capabilities, or remounting their vehicles. chapter 2 2-30 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016fix the enemy 2-117. the commander initiates maneuver at a tempo the enemy cannot match since success in a meeting engagement depends on effective actions on contact. the techniques the commander employs to fix the enemy when both forces are moving are different than those employed when the enemy force is stationary during the meeting engagement. the sbct infantry commander has the organic assets of mgs, icvs, infantry, mortar section, and sniper team to use in order to fix the enemy through maneuver. maneuver 2-118. the commander quickly maneuvers his main body to a position of advantage to conduct a penetration or envelopment if the security force cannot overrun the enemy with a frontal attack. he uses his mission command systems to deploy and direct his forces before the enemy can react effectively or reinforce. the commander attempts to defeat the enemy in detail while still maintaining the momentum of his advance. the main body commander resumes the movement to contact after a successful attack. if he did not defeat the enemy, he has three main options —bypass, transition to a more deliberate attack, or conduct a defense. 2-119. the company commander maneuvers his main body elements rapidly to the vicinity of the contact. the intent is to deliver the assault before the enemy can deploy or reinforce his engaged forces. the commander masses effects of organic and augmented assets on the enemy to maneuver forces on attacking the enemy’s flanks and rear before the enemy can counter these action s. he avoids piecemeal commitment of squads and platoons until he can seize the initiative and maintain it throughout the attack. the commander uses the security force to fix the enemy while the main body maneuvers to look for an assailable flank or he uses the main body to fix the enemy while the security force finds the assailable flank. follow through 2-120. the unit transition back into a movement to contact and continues to advance if the enemy is defeated. the movement to contact terminates when the unit reaches the final objective or limit of advance or it transitions to a more deliberate attack, defense, or retrograde. search and attack 2-121. search and attack is a decentralized movement to contact, requiring multiple, and coordinated reconnaissance patrols to locate and destroy the enemy . it is most often used when operating within noncontiguous areas of operation during a small scale contingency (ssc ). the sbct infantry battalion conducts this form of the movement to contact to destroy enemy forces, deny the enemy certain areas, to protect the force, or for information collection. execution of the search-and-attack will typically be by company-sized elements in battalion-sized aos . this is based on their speed with the mobility of the stryker vehicle and flexibility of their organic task organization primarily in the sbct infantry rifle companies. the sbct may task its subordinate units to conduct the following missions: locate enemy positions or habitually traveled routes. destroy enemy forces within its capability, or fix and block the enemy until reinforcements arrive. maintain surveillance of a larger enemy force through stealth until reinfor cements arrive. search urban areas. secure military or civilian property or installations. organization of forces for a search and attack 2-122. the commander task-organizes the unit into reconnaissance, fixing, and finishing forces, each with a specific purpose and task. the size of the reconnaissance force is based on the available intelligence about the size of enemy forces in the ao. the nature of the operational environment sometimes requires an sbct infantry rifle company to conduct a search and attack while operating in a noncontiguous ao. the commander primarily employs ground forces when the enemy is operating with small, dispersed elements or when the task is to deny the enemy the ability to move within a given area. offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-31 reconnaissance 2-123. the reconnaissance force conducts a zone reconnaissance to reconnoiter identified named areas of interest (nais). once detection is made it is confirmed, preferably through visual contact. the reconnaissance force is small enough to achieve stealth, but large enough to provide adequate self-defense until the fixing and finishing forces arrive. fixing 2-124. the fixing force develops the situation, and then executes one of two options based on the commander ’s guidance and mett-tc. the first option is to block identified routes that the enemy can use to escape or to be reinforced. the fixing or support by fire force maintains contact with the enemy and positions its forces to isolate and fix him before the finishing force attacks. the second option is to conduct an attack to fix the enemy in his current position until the finishing force arrives. the fixing force can be a combination of mgs, icvs, and infantry that can be supported by the mortar section. the fixing force requires enough combat power to isolate the enemy once the reconnaissance force finds him. the fixing force attacks if that action meets the commander ’s intent and it can generate sufficient combat power against the enemy. finishing 2-125. the commander uses his finishing force to destroy the detected and fixed enemy during a search and attack. the sbct infantry rifle company has many organic assets to use in synchronization of maneuver with a combination of mounted, dismounted, and indirect. the sbct infantry rifle company finishes the enemy force in close combat using dismounted infantry. they are supported by precision of crew served weapons on the remote weapons station, mgs, and mortar indirect fires from longer distances to isolate the objective, destroy a retreating force, or disrupt an enemy counterattack. control measures for a search and attack 2-126. the commander establishes control measures that allow for decentralized actions and small-unit initiative to the greatest extent possible. the minimum control measures for a search and attack are an ao, trps, objectives, checkpoints, and contact points. the use of trps facilitates responsive fire support once the reconnaissance force makes contact with the enemy. the commander uses objectives and checkpoints to guide the movement of subordinate elements. coordination points indicate a specific location for coordinating fires and movement between adjacent units. the commander uses other control measures , such as phase lines, as needed. planning a search and attack 2-127. applying all of the warfighting functions, the commander conducts a search and attack for one or more of the following purposes: destroy the enemy. render enemy units in the ao combat-ineffective. deny the area. prevent the enemy from operating unhindered in a given area; for example, in any area he is using for a base camp or for logistics support. protect the force. prevent the enemy from massing to disrupt or destroy friendly military or civilian operations, equipment, property, and key facilities. collect information. gain combat information about the enemy and the terrain to confirm the enemy coa predicted as a result of the ipb process. 2-128. the search and attack plan places the finishing force, as the decisive operation, where it can maneuver to destroy enemy forces or essential facilities located by reconnaissance assets. typically, the finishing force occupies a central location in the ao. however, the mission variables may allow the commander to position the finishing force outside the search and attack area. the commander allocates additional combat power to this decisive operation by using priority of fires and assigning priorities to available combat multipliers, such as engineer elements and helicopter lift support. the commander establishes control measures as needed to consolidate units and concentrate the combat power of the force before the attack. once the reconnaissance force locates the enemy, the fixing and finishing forces can fix chapter 2 2-32 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016and destroy the enemy force. the commander develops a contingency plan in the event that the reconnaissance force is compromised. execution of the search and attack 2-129. each subordinate element operating in its own ao is tasked to destroy the enemy within its capability. the commander should have in place previously established control measures and communications means between any closing elements to prevent fratricide and friendly fire. the reconnaissance force conducts a zone reconnaissance to reconnoiter identified named areas of interest (nais) gain and maintain enemy contact 2-130. once the reconnaissance force finds the enemy force, the fixing force develops the situation and executes one of two options based on the commander ’s guidance and the mission variables of mett-tc. the first option is to block identified routes that the detected enemy can use to escape or rush reinforcements over. the fixing force maintains contact with the enemy and positions its forces to isolate and fix him before the finishing force attacks. the second option is to conduct an attack to fix the enemy in their current positions until the finishing force arrives. the fixing force attacks if that action meets the commander ’s intent and it can generate sufficient combat power against the detected enemy. disrupt the enemy 2-131. the commander integrates direct and indirect fires, terrain, and obstacles to upset an enemy’s formation or tempo, interrupt the enemy’s timetable, or cause enemy forces to commit prematurely or attack in a piecemeal fashion. the force attempting to disrupt an enemy attacks the enemy with enough combat power to achieve desired results with one mass attack or sustain the attack, until it achieves the desired results. it may involve attacking the enemy force while it is still in its assembly areas or in an approach march before it can deploy into a combat formation. fix the enemy 2-132. if conditions are unfavorable for using the finishing force or the main body to attack the detected enemy, the reconnaissance or the fixing force can continue to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance activities to further develop the situation. whenever this occurs, the force maintaining surveillance avoids detection and possible enemy ambushes. maneuver 2-133. the finishing force may move behind the reconnaissance and fixing forces, or it may locate at a pz and air assault into a lz near the enemy once he is located. the finishing force or the main body is responsive enough to engage the enemy before he can break contact with the reconnaissance force or the fixing force. the commander provides additional mobility assets so the finishing force and main body can respond within that timeframe. 2-134. the commander may have the finishing force or the main body established in an area ambush and use the reconnaissance and fixing forces to drive the enemy into the ambushes. follow through 2-135. after the search and attack the commander transitions to the appropriate task; continuing offensive tasks , defensive tasks or stability tasks . cordon and search 2-136. a common tactical mission during operations focused on stability tasks is a cordon and search. the purpose of cordon and search is to obtain weapon caches, materiel or information, a specific highvalue target , or persons of interest. biometric identity data collection enables cordon and search mission by identifying the persons of interest. a cordon and search involves two processes —limiting freedom of movement and searching dwellings. these two actions have the potential to produce negative consequences; therefore, organizing cordon and search elements requires extensive mission tailoring. commanders are prepared for a civil disturbance. (refer to atp 3-06.20 for more information.) offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-33 2-137. searches are an important aspect of populace and resource control. the need to conduct search or to employ search procedures is a continuous requirement. a search can orient on people, materiel, buildings, or terrain. a search usually involves both civil police and soldiers. 2-138. cordon and search involve isolating the target area and searching suspected buildings to capture or destroy possible insurgents or contraband. it involves the emplacement of a cordon, or security perimeter, to prevent traffic in and out of the area. the cordon permits the search element to operate unimpeded within the secured area. the stryker vehicle provides a means of establishing traffic control points by using its size to block high speed avenues of approach. when paired with another stryker vehicle at a point it can provide coverage on both inner and outer cordon security. the remote weapon system (rws) allows the vehicle to engage targets at a distance or in buildings. the top hatches on the rear of the vehicle allow additional personnel to provide security from a protected position. the vehicles themselves are vulnerable to dismounted attacks in close proximity and benefit greatly when protected by dismounts. 2-139. there are two cordon and search techniques: cordon and kick, and cordon, knock, and ask. the cordon and search method selected to accomplish the mission is dependent on a number of factors. the primary consideration is to capture the designated personnel, site, or equipment. additional factors such as the enemy threat, local populace support, and hnsf capabilities are taken into account during operation planning. cordon and kick. the cordon and kick method is used to maintain speed, surprise, and timeliness during entry to the target within the objective. in this instance, considerations of population perceptions and integration of hnsf are less important than accomplishing the task(s) of capturing the target individual, site, or equipment. proper safety precautions will need to be strictly followed. the infantry platoon can also conduct a dynamic breach with use of demolitions and engineers or conduct entering and clearing techniques through available entry points of the buildings. the mgs vehicle can provide a means for creating a breaching point in a target building if roe allows. cordon, knock, and ask. if the mission is focused on increasing the legitimacy of the host nation (hn) government and security forces, it may be necessary to sacrifice a degree of surprise and timeliness to achieve that goal. in this instance, the unit focuses on maintaining a presence and control of an area by incorporating local authorities into the mission. organization of forces for a cordon and search 2-140. a cordon and search requires four elements to perform the major tasks —a command element, a security element, a search and assault element, and a support element. the security element sets up the cordon, which usually comprises an outer cordon “ring” and an inner cordon “ring.” the search and assault element is the decisive operation and will clear and search suspected buildings to capture or destroy insurgents or contraband. the support element may be the reserve, provide support by fire, and be prepared to perform the other cordon and search tasks. command element 2-141. the command element is the headquarters, usually from a battalion, that executes mission command for the cordon and search mission and may have several combat multipliers attached. frequently, the commander is given a variety of assets to assist him in accomplishing his mission. ideally, the commander task-organizes his assets and maintains control of no more than three to five elements. subordinate command elements, such as company headquarters, can provide mission command functions for efforts if the force has more than three to five elements. 2-142. the location of the command element provides the ability to control the subordinate teams and supporting assets of the cordon and search mission. the ability to observe the search and assault element generally causes the command element to collocate with the inner cordon. visibility and communications capability are deciding factors in identifying the best location for the command element during the actual mission. 2-143. the command element may be only a commander and a radio operator, or may include security vehicles, interpreters, host nation officials, or local authorities. the command element remains mobile and able to move to any point within the cordon and search operation to ensure coordination of all elements and chapter 2 2-34 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016supporting assets. when hn forces or authorities are involved in the operation, the command element coordinates with them and integrates them as identified during the planning phase of the operation. operation and communications security is the guiding principle when conducting unified action with hn forces. 2-144. the command element is the single point of coordination for supporting assets and for status reporting to higher headquarters. the command element is a critical component of the cordon and search operation so an alternate element is designated in the event it becomes combat ineffective. the command element ensures that all actions are documented when necessary and that the rules of engagement are followed. the command element monitors the documentation, security, and transport of every person detained. the command element ensures that damage caused during the cordon and search is documented to identify legitimate future claims by the occupants of the target. security element 2-145. the security element’s primary task is to isolate the target area. the security element limits enemy or civilian influence in the objective area and prevents targets from escaping the cordon. it is usually comprised of a stryker infantry rifle platoon. it can be task-organized with sniper, mgs, and mortar section to assist with isolating the target area. they may have to use multiple avenues of approach and operate decentralized to accomplish their mission. they may have to establish multiple blocking positions and observation posts and conduct patrols to isolate the target area. the security element may include — vehicle-mounted sections or platoons. interpreter(s). detainee teams. crowd control teams. traffic control points or blocking positions. hnsf (military or police). integrated aviation assets. infantry squads or platoons. female search teams. small unmanned ground vehicles (sugv) to assist in searches. nonlethal munitions (for example, rubber pellets, bean bag rounds, and tear gas.) for crowd control. biometric identify data collection team. 2-146. the execution of the outer cordon mission is an integral part of the security element in any cordon and search mission. the outer cordon isolates the objective area and prevents enemy or civilian influence. as such, it requires detailed planning, coordination, integration, and synchronization to achieve the combined arms effects, lethal and nonlethal, required for mission execution. some considerations for the outer cordon include — vehicles for traffic control points or blocking positions. fire planning and coordination. overwatch positions. aviation assets to observe target area and inform outer cordon if vehicles or persons leave the target area. constant communication between the aviation element and the outer cordon facilitate the isolation of the target area. an initial detainee collection point for the receipt and temporary holding of detainees. an initial material collection point for consolidation of captured material. 2-147. each subordinate outer cordon element (traffic control point, blocking position) has a designated leader and a clear task and purpose. weapons systems to consider for outer cordon positions are primarily icv and mgs variants with rws, crew-served weapons, javelin with the command launch unit (clu), and snipers or designated marksman. keeping dismounts in close proximity and to the rear of the vehicles increase their security. offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-35 2-148. the leader of the outer cordon element develops and maintains sa of his area of responsibility and the areas of the inner cordon and the search elements. this enables him to anticipate threat activity, control direct and indirect fires, and facilitate the achievement of the outer cordon’s task and purpose. aviation assets, communications systems, and reporting procedures are implemented to facilitate sa for the entire element. search and assault element 2-149. the search and assault element’s mission is to assault, clear, and search the objective to capture, kill, or destroy the targeted individuals or materials. the search and assault is one or more stryker infantry rifle platoons. an mgs vehicle can be task-organized to this element to create a breach point or provide support by fire (see appendix a for more information). the search and assault element initiates action once the outer and inner cordons are in place. the element accomplishes its mission by gaining a foothold on or in the target to clear all enemy and noncombatant personnel, and by conducting a systematic search of the target areas. these areas may be searched selectively (only specific rooms, buildings, or blocks) or systematically (everything within a given area). due to the split-second decisions that have to be made, it is imperative that this element thoroughly understands the roe and can execute in a dynamic environment. 2-150. to accomplish its mission the search and assault element has three primary tasks —securing, clearing, and searching the target. the search and assault element may be task-organized into four teams — assault, search, security, and support to facilitate accomplishing its mission. all of these teams understand and prepare to assume the role of the other teams in the search and assault element. site exploitation 2-151. site exploitation (se) is systematically searching for and collecting information, material, and persons from a designated location and analyzing them to answer information requirements, facilitate subsequent operations, or support criminal prosecution. primarily, se is a means of gathering information that supports the intelligence process. three purposes for se are — to answer information requirements (usually commander’s critical in formation requirements [ccirs] ). to facilitate subsequent operations (already planned or not yet anticipated). to facilitate criminal prosecution by host-nation or international authorities (related to war crimes). 2-152. se missions may concentrate on one fundamental purpose or involve all three simultaneously. the purpose of the site exploitation should be considered throughout the commander’s tlps. the development of intelligence, through immediate analysis or off-site processing can enable the commander to target additional objectives. at the company level, many of the se-related activities answer higher headquarters intelligence requirements. 2-153. the forces executing se provide critical data for inclusion in the intelligence process which subsequently supports operations already planned or not yet anticipated. they identify information, materiel, and persons of interest; and collect, record, and preserve these items. after the mission is completed, they are debriefed by appropriate intelligence representatives, usually the battalion s-2 or the company coist. the information (in any medium or form), material, or persons collected are processed by the appropriate agencies and analyzed to produce intelligence that will support ongoing or subsequent operations. 2-154. during stability tasks, units can use se to gain intelligence that supports criminal prosecution by host-nation authorities. clearly documenting the details surrounding the initial detention, preserving evidence and maintaining chain of custody are critical and aid in determining if further detention is warranted, classifying the detainee, developing intelligence, and prosecuting detainees suspected of committing criminal acts. documentation should be detailed and answer the six ws: who, what, when, where, why, and witnesses. chapter 2 2-36 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016support element 2-155. the support element reinforces, and is capable of accomplishing, the task and purpose of the unit’s decisive operation. this element is usually task-organized toward a specific purpose and can be comprised of any subordinate units with the sbct infantry rifle company . the commander may direct the support element to accomplish priority planning tasks. this means that the support element leader is intimately familiar with all aspects of the cordon and search mission from planning through its completion. 2-156. the commander identifies the tasks the support element needs to execute. these tasks are prioritized and given to the support element leader so he can plan and rehearse these actions according to the commander’s plan. probable tasks assigned to the support element during a cordon and search are as follows, but are not limited to — reinforce outer and inner cordon. clear buildings. search buildings. secure, safeguard, and escort civilians or detainees. secure and safeguard captured material or equipment. biometric identify data collection team. pursues enemy elements that bypass or escape inner and outer cordon. 2-157. commitment criteria is a guide to assist the commander in deciding when to commit the support element, but is not intended to be a trigger for employment. possible commitment criteria are as follows: hostile crowd forming around inner cordon. loss of main effort. numerous rooms in building being searched. more than a specified number of detainees. enemy engages inner cordon. control measures for a cordon and search 2-158. the use of standard tactical control measures is essential to effective mission command over forces approaching and conducting cordon and search. assembly areas. assembly areas are the most convenient areas for staging a cordon and search due to the relative safety, size, and location. however, commanders assume that all friendly positions are under constant observation. if possible, position assembly areas in remote or separate areas or use multiple assembly areas to minimize any enemy surveillance efforts. checkpoints. checkpoints leading to the target and in the objective area are essential in ensuring that all units arrive at the target in the proper order and on time. target reference points. weapon orientation for crew served weapons is a key safety consideration. surface danger zones will need consideration with the types of munitions potentially fired from the weapon systems particularly with mgs main gun, .50 cal and mk-19 if used. a method of orienting on check points and rally points as trps is also acceptable. rally points. rally points to and from the objective area allow for cordon and search elements to reorganize if units become engaged, lost, have vehicle trouble, or lose communications during ingress and egress from the target. phase lines. phase lines (pls) are helpful in controlling cordon and search elements that are approaching the target from different directions or at different times. 2-159. techniques for cordon and search success are as follows: position key leaders so that they can see and control all subordinate elements. position key assets such as crew-served weapons and interpreters at the critical locations. be prepared to move leadership and support assets from one location to another during mission execution or as needed. offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-37 when executing searches and biometrics identity data collection, position vehicles and personnel to be searched so that the security element’s sectors of fi re face to the outside of the friendly element and away from noncombatants. keep the bulk of the forces within the perimeter so that if the situation escalates they are essentially in a battle or support by fire position. ensure that all personnel understand the direct fire plan and any contingency plans. for example — what actions to take in the event a vehicle penetrates a traffic control point (tcp) from outside the established perimeter. who engages and with what weapons systems. when to cease fire, and what signal to use for cease fire. planning a cordon and search 2-160. commanders consider numerous factors when planning and preparing for a cordon and search. commanders apply the same steps used in tlp’s, applying the warfighting functions as discussed in chapter 1. when the objective of the cordon and search is a high-payoff target (hpt), the planning time can be extremely limited between when a sbct infantry rifle company receives the mission from higher headquarters and when it actually executes the mission. planning time may require planning by key leaders of all the elements and accelerated tlps due to the complexity of the mission and the many assets taskorganized to support the operation. as in all cases, the quality of the intelligence associated with mett-tc is critical. in particular, the “civil considerations ” variable of mett-tc should be specifically considered, and interpreters and biometric tactical collection devices and operators (to positively identify or verify an hvi) should be added, as required. (see figure 2-15 on -39.) preparing a cordon and search 2-161. a search can orient on people, material, buildings, or terrain. it often involves civil police and soldiers. authority for search has to be carefully reviewed. military personnel perform searches only in areas of military jurisdiction (or where otherwise lawful). they conduct searches only to apprehend suspects or to secure evidence to an offence. collection of biometric identity data enables the identification or verification of people. 2-162. soldiers record and maintain the chain of custody for the seizure of contraband, evidence, captured enemy or detainee documents, weapons, and materiel, supplies, or other items for the seizure to be of legal value. search teams have detailed instructions for handling controlled items. lists of prohibited or controlled distribution items should be widely disseminated and on hand during searches. the unit contacts military or civil police who work with the populace and the resource control program before the search begin. units consider the effect of early warning on the effectiveness of their search. 2-163. a unit conducts search at a pace to help ensure an effective search, but rapidly enough to prevent the enemy from reacting to the search. soldiers use only the necessary force to eliminate any resistance encountered. there should be plans for securing the search area (establishing a cordon) and for handling detained personnel. executing a cordon and search 2-164. cordon and search involves isolating the target area and searching suspected buildings to capture or destroy possible insurgents or contraband. 2-165. an effective cordon is critical to the success of the search effort. cordons are designed to prevent persons of interest from escaping, prevent insurgents from reinforcing, and protect the forces conducting the operation. based on factors of mett-tc, the sbct infantry rifle company can establish an inner cordon and an outer cordon. a mounted sbct infantry rifle company is best suited to provide the outer cordon given its mobility and armaments. both cordon elements emphasize on inward and outward for security purposes. (see figure 2 -15 on -39 .) 2-166. the outer cordon’s composition and capabilities should be based on mett -tc. the mission of the outer cordon is to provide containment and prevent a high-value target (hvt) from escaping the chapter 2 2-38 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016objective area. the outer cordon may have to accomplish this task by being more terrain-oriented to reemphasize on the most probable avenues of approach into and out of the objective area. the outer cordon can be tasked to block specific locations and prevent escape from inside and interference from outside of the objective area. 2-167. the mission of the inner cordon is to contain the immediate vicinity of the target to prevent escape and provide security to the search and assault element. if the cordon and search is opposed by a hostile force, the inner cordon provides sbf. the inner cordon provides direct fires to suppress the enemy force and allow maneuver of the search and assault element to the objective. 2-168. due to the congested nature of the urban environment, direct fire control measures can be complicated. one proven technique is for the unit to number buildings, letter building corners, and number floors. this way, a request for immediate direct fire suppression can be specific and the risk of collateral damage, and fratricide is reduced. the fire command can be, “immediate suppression, two personnel with weapons, building 23, side a-b, second floor, second window, fire when ready”. fires are precise and accurate as opposed to high volume because of the condensed and compressed nature of the physical area. offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-39 figure 2-15 . establishment of a cordon section iii – attack 2-169. an attack is an offensive task that destroys or defeats enemy forces, seizes and secures terrain, or both (adrp 3-90). an attack is a primary offensive task that destroys or defeats enemy forces, seizes and secures terrain, or both. (refer to fm 3-90-1 for more information.) 2-170. the primary difference between a deliberate and a hasty attack is the extent of planning and preparation that the attacking force conducts. at one end of the continuum, the sbct infantry rifle company launches hasty attacks as a continuation of a meeting engagement to exploit a combat power advantage and to preempt enemy actions. at the other end of the continuum, the sbct infantry rifle company conducts a deliberate attack from a reserve position or assembly area with detailed knowledge of the enemy, a task organization designed specifically for the attack, and a fully rehearsed plan. most attacks fall somewhere between the two ends of the continuum. chapter 2 2-40 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 2-171. the commander conducts a deliberate attack against a strong enemy position. as the company prepares for the attack, the enemy continues to strengthen his position. a deliberate attack is a fully synchronized mission that employs every available asset against the enemy defense. it is characterized by a high volume of planned fires, use of major supporting attacks, forward positioning of resources needed to maintain momentum, and operations throughout the depth of enemy positions. deliberate attacks follow a preparatory period that includes planning, reconnaissance, coordination, positioning of follow-on forces and reserves, preparation of troops and equipment, rehearsals, and operational refinement. 2-172. the commander conducts a hasty attack during movement to contact, as part of a defense, or when he determines that the enemy is in a vulnerable position and can be quickly defeated. the sbct infantry rifle company usually conducts a hasty attack immediately, with available resources. this type of attack may cause the attacking force to lose a degree of synchronization. to minimize this risk, the commander maximizes use of standard formations and well-rehearsed, thoroughly understood battle drills and sops. a hasty attack often is the preferred option during continuous operations. it enables the commander to maintain the momentum while denying the enemy the time needed to prepare his defenses. organization of forces 2-173. once the commander determines the scheme of maneuver, the commander task-organizes the force to ensure he has enough combat power to accomplish its mission. the commander organizes into a security force, a main body, and a reserve, all of which are supported by some type of sustainment organization. the commander should complete any changes in task organization in time to allow units to conduct rehearsals with their attached and supporting elements. security forces 2-174. under normal circumstances, the commander resources dedicated security forces during an attack only if the attack will uncover one or more flanks or the rear of the attacking force as it advances. in this case, the commander designates a flank or rear security force and assigns it a guard or screen mission, depending on the mission variables and factors of mett-tc. the security force can be comprised of a platoon, section, or squad, attached with the sniper team. main body 2-175. the commander organizes the main body into combined arms formations to conduct the decisive operation and necessary shaping operations. the commander aims the decisive operation toward the immediate and decisive destruction of the enemy force, its will to resist, seizure of a terrain objective, or the defeat of the enemy’s plan. the maneuver scheme identifies the decisive operation. all of the force’s available resources operate in concert to assure the success of the decisive operation. the subordinate unit or units designated to conduct the decisive operation can change during the course of the attack. the commander designates an assault, breach, and support force if the commander expects to conduct a breach during the attack. the assault force is primarily made of infantry. the breach force can be a combination of infantry, combat engineers (when augmented), or mgs depending on the obstacle. the support force is usually comprised of mgs, the mortar section, and icv’s using crew served weapons. infantry can be used to provide local security for the stryker vehicles in the support force. 2-176. if it is impractical to determine when or where the echelon’s decisive operation will be, such as during a hasty attack, the commander retains flexibility by arranging forces in depth, holding out strong reserves, and maintaining centralized control of long-range fire support systems. as soon as the tactical situation develops to allow the commander to designate the decisive operation, the commander focuses available resources to support that decisive operation. enemy actions, minor changes in the situation, or the lack of success by other elements cannot be allowed to divert either forces or their effects from the decisive operation ( fm 3-90-1). reserve 2-177. the commander uses the reserve to exploit success, defeat enemy counterattacks, or restore momentum to a stalled attack. for a company mission, this would usually be a squad-size force. for a battalion mission, it usually is a platoon size element. once committed, the reserve’s actions normally become or reinforce the echelon’s decisive operation, and the commander makes every effort to offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-41 reconstitute another reserve from units made available by the revised situation. often the commander’s most difficult and important decision concerns the time, place, and circumstances for committing the reserve. the reserve is not a committed force; it is not used as a follow and support force, or as a follow and assume force. the commander decides what type of reserve force is best suited according to mett-t c when using sbct units. the reserve can be comprised of mgs, infantry squads with stryker vehicles or combination of. 2-178. in the attack, the combat power allocated to the reserve depends primarily on the level of uncertainty about the enemy, especially the strength of any expected enemy counterattacks. the commander only needs to resource a small reserve to respond to unanticipated enemy reactions when detailed intelligence about the enemy exists. when the situation is relatively clear and enemy capabilities are limited, the reserve may consist of a small fraction of the command. when the situation is vague, the reserve may initially contain most of the commander’s combat power ( fm 3-90-1). sus tainment organization 2-179. the commander resources his sustainment assets to support the attacking force. the commander organizes the supporting sustainment and other logistics assets into combat and field trains and they are overseen by the 1sg . control measures for an attack 2-180. units conducting offensive tasks are assigned an ao within which to operate. within the ao the commander designates the following control measures regardless of whether the attack takes place in a contiguous environment or a noncontiguous environment: aos for all pertinent battalion level and below subordinate, adjacent, host-nation, or allied forces within the operating area . pl as the ld, which also may be the line of contact (lc). time to initiate the mission. objective. 2-181. the commander can use any other control measures necessary to control the attack. short of the ld and lc, the commander may designate assembly areas and attack positions where the unit prepares for offensive tasks or waits for the establishment of the required conditions to initiate the attack. beyond the ld and lc, the commander may designate checkpoints, pls, probable line of deployment (pld), assault positions, direct fire control measures, and fire support coordination measures. a final coordination line (fcl), assault positions, sbf, and attack by fire positions, and time of assault to further control the final stage of the attack can be used between the pld and the objective. beyond the objective the commander can impose an loa if the commander does not want the unit to conduct exploitation or a pursuit (fm 3-90-1 ). planning an attack 2-182. friendly forces seek to place the enemy in a position where the enemy can easily be defeated or destroyed in an attack. the commander seeks to keep the enemy off-balance while continually reducing the enemy’s options. in an attack the commander focuses movement and maneuver effects, supported by the other warfighting functions, on those enemy forces that seek to prevent the unit from accomplishing its mission and seizing its objective. planning helps the commander synchronize the effects of combat power through tlps. (refer to adp 5-0 for more information ). mission command 2-183. the commander states the desired effect of fires on the enemy weapons systems, such as suppression or destruction, as part of his planning process. the commander assigns subordinate units their missions and imposes the control measures needed to synchronize and maintain control over the operation. he plans redundant forms of communication to his subordinate units to facilitate quick and timely responses to adjustments to the plan. these forms of communication will often change between voice, digital, and visual signals as phases of the operation are completed. chapter 2 2-42 atp 3-21.11 4 february 20162-184. the commander determines the probable lc and enemy trigger lines using the enemy situational and weapons templates previously developed. as the commander arrays subordinate elements to shape the ao, fri endly weapons systems are matched against the enemy’s to determine the pld. once the commander determines the pld, he establishes how long it takes subordinates to move from the ld to the pld and any support-by-fire positions the attack requires. the commander establishes when and where the force maneuvers into enemy direct-fire range. 2-185. every attack plan contains provisions for exploiting success or any advantages that may arise to accomplish the mission. the commander exploits success by aggressively executing the plan, promoting subordinate leader initiative, and using units that can rapidly execute battle drills. movement and maneuver 2-186. in the plan of attack, the commander seeks to surprise the enemy by choosing an unexpected direction, time, type, or strength for the attack and by exploiting the success of military deception operations. surprise delays enemy reactions, overloads and confuses enemy mission command, induces psychological shock in the enemy, and reduces the coherence of the enemy defense. the commander achieves tactical surprise by attacking in bad weather and over seemingly impassible terrain, conducting feints and demonstrations, maintaining a high tempo, destroying enemy forces, and employing sound operations security (opsec). the commander plans different attack times for the decisive and shaping operations to mislead the enemy and allow the shifting of supporting fires to successive attacking echelons. however, simultaneous attacks provide a means to maximize the effects of mass in the initial assault. they prevent the enemy from concentrating defensive fires against successive attacks. 2-187. when planning an attack, the commander and subordinate leaders focus on the routes, formations, navigational aids, dismount locations, or dismount criteria they will use to traverse the ground from the ld or pd to the objective. some terrain locations may require the attacking unit to change its combat formation, direction of movement, or movement technique when it reaches those locations. sbct commanders need to consider how and where they will use the mgs platoon in the attack. this includes the mgs task organization with techniques of keeping them pure with company commander control, assigning a squad for their additional protection, task organizing one or all mgs vehicles to support each of the infantry platoons. the unit can post guides at these critical locations to ensure maintaining control over the movement ( fm 3-90 -1). inte lligence 2-188. the commander needs to have detailed knowledge of the enemy’s organiza tion, equipment, and tactics to employ his capabilities and tactics. the commander needs to understand the enemy’s strengths and weaknesses. the coist aids the commander with these tasks. 2-189. the commander cannot conduct a deliberate attack if he does not have good intelligence and, therefore, does not know where most of the enemy’s units and systems are located. the attacking unit can conduct a movement to contact, a hasty attack, or conduct additional information collection . fires 2-190. the planning process synchr onizes the unit’s maneuver with the provision of fire support. it identifies critical times and places where the commander needs the maximum effects from fire-support assets and direct fire assets to include the mgs platoon and the company mortar section. the commander combines maneuver with fires to mass effects, achieve surprise, destroy enemy forces, and obtain decisive results. 2-191. company commanders will often find themselves as the observer (and executor) of battalion fires. understanding how to echelon fires is critical for the indirect fire plan to be effectively synchronized with the maneuver plan. the purpose of echeloning fires is to maintain constant fires on a target while using the optimum delivery system to the point of its risk-estimate distance in combat operations or minimum safe distance in training. echeloning fires provides protection for friendly forces as they move to and assault an objective, allowing them to close with minimal casualties. it prevents the enemy from observing and engaging the assault by forcing the enemy to take cover, allowing the friendly force to continue the advance unimpeded. offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-43 2-192. the commander’s attack criteria goal is to concentrate fires on seizing the initiative. the commander emphasizes simple and rapidly integrated fire support plans. this is done using quick-fire planning techniques and good sops. the commander integrates fire assets as far forward as possible in the movement formation to facilitate early emplacement. fires concentrate (mass) on forward enemy element s to enable maneuver efforts to close with the enemy positions. sustainment 2-193. sustainment is the provision of the logistics, personnel services, and health service support necessary to maintain operations until successful mission completion (adrp 4-0). the commander plans , along with the xo and 1sg, to provide sustainment to ensure freedom of action, extend operational reach, and prolong endurance. the sustainment plan includes medical evacuation (medevac) and casevac, vehicle recovery, and resupply during the execution and consolidation and reorganization phase of the attack. this plan must synchronize with the movement and maneuver so that actions taken in the event of a casualty, loss of vehicle, or critical item do not compromise the mission or retask combat power. protection 2-194. protection facilitates the commander’s ability to maintain the force’s integrity and combat power. it determines the degree to which potential threats can disrupt operations and counters or mitigates those threats. emphasis on protection increases during preparation and continues throughout execution. protection is a continuing activity; it integrates all protection capabilities to safeguard bases, secure routes, and protect forces. preparing an attack 2-195. attacks are best organized and coordinated in assembly areas. if the commander decides that rapid action is essential to retain a tactical advantage he may opt not to use an assembly area. detailed advance planning, combined with effective communications, sop, and battle drills, reduces negative impacts of such a decision. 2-196. unless already in an assembly area, the attacking unit moves into one during the preparation phase. the unit moves with as much secrecy as possible, normally at night, and along routes that prevent or degrade the enemy’ s capabilities to visually observe or otherwise detect the movement. it avoids congesting its assembly area and occupies it for the shortest length of time possible. each unit is responsible for its own security activities, such as local ground security, while in the assembly area. 2-197. the attacking unit should continue its tlps and priorities of work to the extent the situation and mission allow before moving to attack positions. these preparations include, but are not necessarily limited to— protecting the force. conducting task organization. performing reconnaissance. refining the plan and updating mission data into mission command systems . briefing the troops. conducting rehearsals, to include test firing of weapons. moving sustainment and medical support forward. promoting adequate rest for both leaders, and soldiers. positioning the force for subsequent action. 2-198. leaders at all levels should conduct a reconnaissance of the actual terrain when it will not compromise operational security or result in excessive risk to the unit leadership as part of tlps. modern information systems and reconnaissance assets enable leaders to conduct a virtual reconnaissance when a physical reconnaissance is not practical. if a limited-visibility attack is planned, they should reconnoiter the terrain at night ( fm 3-90-1). chapter 2 2-44 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016rehearsals 2-199. the commander exercises and refines the maneuver, fire, and sustainment plans during rehearsals, which are an important part of ensuring the plan’s coordination and synchronization. as part of the rehearsal process, the commander reviews his decision points and the anticipated battle sequence with subordinate leaders, ensuring all units understand the plan, the relationship between fire and movement, and the synchronization of critical events. these critical events include — actions on the objective. reconnaissance handover. moving from the assembly area to the ld. maneuvering from the ld to the pld, to include dismount points. occupying support-by-fire positions. conducting the breach or gap crossing if applicable. consolidating on the objective. exploiting success or pursuing a withdrawing enemy. actions of echelon reserves. resupply operations. 2-200. the unit should conduct rehearsals under as many types of adverse conditions as possible, with time and other restraints, to identify and prepare the unit to cope with problems. at lower tactical echelons, the rehearsal includes battle drills, such as creating lanes through minefields, react to contact, loss of communications, casevac, and so forth. executing an attack 2-201. a series of advances and assaults by attacking units until they secure the final objective characterizes the attack. commanders at all levels use their initiative to rapidly shift their main effort between units to take advantage of opport unities and momentum that ensure the enemy’s rapid destruction. attacking units move as quickly as possible following reconnaissance elements or successful probes through gaps in the enemy’s defenses. they shift their strength to reinforce success and carr y the operation deep into the enemy’s rear. 2-202. stryker infantry rifle companies conduct attacks after analyzing information about the enemy through reconnaissance, maneuvering to a dismount point, deploying its infantry, and initiating contact with enemy forces from a place of tactical advantage. 2-203. the commander does not delay the attack to preserve the alignment of subordinate units or to adhere closely to the preconceived plan of attack. he avoids becoming so committed to the initial plan that opportunities are neglected. he is mentally prepared to abandon failed attacks and to exploit any unanticipated successes or enemy errors by designating another unit to conduct the decisive operation in response to the changing situation (fm 3-90-1). gain and maintain enemy contact 2-204. gaining and maintaining contact with the enemy when he is determined to break that contact is vital to the success of offensive tasks. a defending enemy establishes a security area around his forces to make early contact with the attacking forces to determine their capabilities, intent, and chosen coa and to delay their approach. the enemy commander wants to use his security area to strip away friendly reconnaissance forces and hide his dispositions, capabilities, and intent. his goal is to compel the attacking force to conduct a movement to contact against his forces to determine the exact location of the attacking forces. 2-205. stryker units gain and maintain contact through reconnaissance forward with sensors detecting the enemy and maneuvering to confirm or deny their presence. information gained from reconnaissance is quickly shared through mission commands systems laterally and vertically throughout the sbct to allow its combat units to maneuver and destroy the threat. offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-45 disrupt the enemy 2-206. disrupting one or more parts of the enemy weakens his entire force and allows the friendly commander to attack the remaining enemy force in piecemeal. the assessment and decisions regarding what to disrupt, when to disrupt, and to what end are critical. 2-207. once any type of contact is made with the enemy, the commander wants to use the element of surprise to conduct shaping operations that strike at the enemy and disrupt both the enemy’s combined arms team and his ability to plan and control his forces. once this disruption begins, it continues throughout the attack. fix the enemy 2-208. a primary purpose in fixing the enemy is to isolate the objective of the force conducting the echelons decisive operation to prevent the enemy from maneuvering to reinforce the unit targeted for destruction. the commander limits the options available to his opponent. fixing an enemy into a given position or a coa and controlling his movements limit his options and reduce the amount of uncertainty in the ao. 2-209. fixing the enemy is done with the minimum amount of force. the commander allocates the bulk of his combat power to the force conducting his decisive operation, so fixing is, by necessity, shaping operations that illustrate economy of force as a principle of war. therefore, the commander carefully considers which enemy elements to fix and target only those that can significantly affect the outcome of the fight. maneuver 2-210. the commander maneuvers his forces to gain positional advantage so he can seize, retain, and exploit the initiative. he av oids the enemy’s defensive strength. he employs tactics that defeat the enemy by attacking through a point of relative weakness, such as a flank or the rear. the key to success is to strike hard and fast, overwhelm a portion of the enemy force, then quickly transition to the next objective or phase, thus maintaining the momentum of the attack without reducing the pressure. the commander considers the following to conduct maneuvers — movement from the line of departure to the probable line of deployment. actions at the probable line of deployment, assault position, or final coordination line. breaching. actions on the objective. follow through. movement from the line of departure to the probable line of deployment 2-211. the unit transitions from troop movement to maneuver once it crosses the ld. it moves aggressively and as quickly as the terrain and enemy situation allow. it moves forward using appropriate movement techniques assisted by the fires of supporting units. fire and movement are closely integrated and coordinated. effective suppressive fires facilitate friendly movement, and friendly movement facilitates more effective fires. whenever possible, the attacking unit uses avenues of approach that avoid strong enemy defensive positions, takes advantage of all available cover and concealment, and places the unit on the flanks and rear of the defending enemy. the unit uses obscurants to conceal its movement when cover and concealment are not available. actions at the probable line of deployment, assault position, or final coordination line 2-212. the attacking unit maintains the pace of its advance as it approaches its pld. the attacking unit splits into one or more assault and support forces once it reaches the pld, if not previously completed. all forces supporting the assault force should be in their support-by-fire positions before the assault force crosses the pld. the commander synchronizes the occupation of these support-by -fire positions with the maneuver of the supported attacking unit to limit the vulnerability of the forces occupying these positions. the commander uses unit tactical sops, battle drills, prearranged signals, eas, and trps to control the chapter 2 2-46 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 direct fires from these supporting positions. the commander employs restricted fire lines between converging forces. breaching 2-213. once the support force sets the conditions, the breach force reduces, clears, and marks the required number of lanes through the enemy’s tactical obstacles to support the maneuver of the assault force. the commander identifies the conditions that allow the breach force to proceed to avoid confusion. from the pld, the assault force maneuvers against or around the enemy to take advantage of the support force’s efforts to suppress the targeted enemy positions. successful obstacle breaching depends on effectively applying the breaching fundamentals of suppress, obscure, secure, reduce, and assault (sosra). (see chapter 7 , section viii, this publication for more information about breaching). actions on the objective 2-214. the effects of the overwhelming and simultaneous application of fire, movement, and shock action characterize the final assault. this violent assault destroys or defeats and drives the enemy from the objective area. small units conduct the final assault while operating under the control of the appropriate echelon cp. 2-215. the commander employs all fire support means to destroy and suppress the enemy and sustain the momentum of the attack. the commander improves the likelihood of success by carefully synchronizing the effects of indirect-fire systems and available cas. fires are planned in series or groups to support maneuver against enemy forces on or near the geographical objective. the assault element moves rapidly across the objective as the commander shifts artillery fires and obscurants from the objective to other targets. the support element does not allow its suppressive fires to lapse. these fires isolate the objective and prevent the enemy from reinforcing or counterattacking. they destroy escaping enemy forces and systems ( fm 3-90-1). follow through 2-216. the commander has two alternatives after seizing the objective —exploit success and continue the attack or terminate the offensive task. the most likely on-order mission is to continue the attack after seizing the objective. the commander continues tlp in preparation for any on-order missions assigned by a higher headquarters during consolidation. 2-217. upon termination of the attack, the commander consolidates and reorganizes. he establishes a hasty defense on the limit of advance off the objective area with the assaulting force. the supporting elements of the attack follow the assaulting elements path to link up with the remainder of the company. once consolidated, the commander searches the objective for any enemy forces, captured equipment, prisoners, or anything that may provide valuable intelligence, if the tactical situation allows. simultaneously, the company conducts accountability of personnel, recovery of equipment, and cross levels ammunition. resupply and maintenance are follow-on tasks established in the priorities of work determined by the commander and based on mett-tc . special-purpose attacks 2-218. special purpose attacks are ambush, counterattack, demonstration, feint, raid, and spoiling attack (fm 3-90-1 ). the commander’s intent and t he mission variables of mett-tc determine which special purpose attack(s) to employ. each attack can be conducted as either a hasty or deliberate attack. the commander’s intent and mett -tc mission variables and factors determine the specific attack form. a s subordinate attack tasks, they share many of the planning, preparation, and execution considerations of the attack. demonstrations and feints, while forms of attack, are associated with military deception operations (fm 3-13). ambush 2-219. an ambush is an attack by fire, or other destructive means, from concealed positions on a moving or temporarily halted enemy. an ambush stops, denies, or destroys enemy forces by maximizing the element of surprise. ambushes can employ direct fire systems and other destructive means, such as offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-47 command-detonated mines, indirect fires, and supporting nonlethal effects. they include an assault to close with and destroy enemy forces. in an ambush, ground objectives do not have to be seized and held. 2-220. the three types of ambush are —point ambush, area ambush, and antiarmor ambush. in a point ambush, a unit deploys to attack a single kill zone. in an area ambush, a unit deploys into two or more related point ambushes. units smaller than a platoon do not usually conduct an area ambush. 2-221. a typical ambush consists of three elements —assault, support, and security. the assault element fires into the kill and clears zone. its goal is to destroy the enemy force. it may be assigned additional tasks , such as — searching for items of intelligence value. capturing prisoners. photographing new types of equipment . when unable to take enemy equipment, completing the destruction of said equipment to avoid its immediate reuse. 2-222. the support element supports the assault element by firing into and around the kill zone, and provides the ambush’s primary killing power. the support element attempts to destroy most of the enemy combat power before the assault element moves into the objective or kill zone. the security element isolates the kill zone, provides early warning of the arrival of any enemy relief force, and provides security for the assault and support elements. it secures the objective rally point and blocks enemy avenues of approach into and out of the ambush site, which prevents the enemy from entering or leaving. counterattack 2-223. a counterattack is an attack by part or all of a defending force against an enemy attacking force. units conduct counterattacks to seize the initiative from the enemy through offensive action (for example, regaining lost ground, or cutting off or destroying enemy advance units). the objective of counterattack is to deny the enemy his goal when attacking. the commander usually directs a counterattack from a defensive posture —to defeat or destroy enemy forces, exploit an enemy weakness, such as an exposed flank, or to regain control of terrain and facilities after an enemy success. a counterattacking force maneuvers to isolate and destroy a designated enemy force. it can attack by fire into an ea to defeat or destroy an enemy force, restore the original position, or block an enemy penetration. once launched, the counterattack becomes a decisive operation for the commander conducting the counterattack. 2-224. to be decisive, the counterattack occurs when the enemy is overextended, dispersed, and disorganized during his attack. all counterattacks should be rehearsed under the same conditions in which they will actually be conducted. careful consideration is given to the event that will trigger the counterattack. once committed, the counterattack force conducts the decisive operation. 2-225. sbct’s conduct counter attacks assisted with the use of mission command systems and maneuver to a point of tactical advantage to initiate the attack with the enemy forces. they take advantage of the speed and protection of their vehicles to deploy and initiate their attacks. demonstrations 2-226. a demonstration is a form of attack designed to deceive the enemy as to the location or time of the decisive operation by a display of force. forces conducting a demonstration do not seek contact with the enemy as intended. feints 2-227. a feint is a limited attack used to deceive the enemy as to the location or time of the actual decisive operation. forces conducting a feint seek direct fire contact with the enemy, but avoid decisive engagement. as in the demonstration, the commander uses feints in conjunction with other military deception activities. raid 2-228. a raid is a limited-objective, deliberate attack that entails swift penetration of hostile terrain. it is not intended to hold territory and has to have a planned withdrawal. a raid requires detailed intelligence, chapter 2 2-48 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016preparation, and planning. the sbct infantry rifle company conducts raids as part of a larger force to accomplish a number of missions, to include the following: capture prisoners, installations, or enemy materiel. capture or destroy specific enemy mission command locations. destroy enemy materiel or installations. obtain intelligence concerning enemy locations, dispositions, strength, intentions, or methods of operation. confuse the enemy or disrupt his plans. liberate friendly personnel. spoiling attack 2-229. a spoiling attack is a tactical maneuver employed to seriously impair a hostile attack while the enemy is in the process of forming or assembling for an attack. a spoiling attack usually employs armored , attack helicopter, or fire support elements to attack on enemy assembly positions in front of a main line of resistance or battle position ( fm 3-90-1). 2-230. the objective of a spoiling attack is to disrupt the enemy’s offensive capabilities and timelines while destroying targeted enemy personnel and equipment, not to secure terrain and other physical objectives. conditions when conducting spoiling attack are: the spoiling attack’s objective needs to be obtainable. the enemy should be unable to respond to the attack in a synchronized and coordinated manner. the commander prevents the force conducting the spoiling attack from becoming over extended. section iv – transitions 2-231. the commander halts an offensive task when it results in complete victory and ends hostilities, reaches a culminating point, or the commander receives a change in mission from a higher commander. this change in mission may be a result of the interrelationship of the other elements of national power, such as a political decision. consolidation 2-232. consolidation is organizing and strengthening a newly captured position so that it can be defended. the attacking unit tries to exploit its success regardless of the assault type. in some situations, however, the unit may have to consolidate its gains. consolidation may vary from a rapid repositioning of forces and security elements on the objective, to a reorganization of the attacking force, to the organization and detailed improvement of the position for defense. 2-233. consolidation comprise s actions taken to secure the objective and defend against an enemy counterattack. consideration should be given that the enemy that occupied the objective may have planned indirect fire targets to assist in their counterattack. the commander ensures that the sbct infantry rifle company is ready to conduct the following actions that usually are part of consolidation: eliminate enemy resistance on the objective. establish security beyond the objective by securing areas that may be the source of enemy direct fires or enemy artillery observation. establish additional security measures such as ops and patrols. prepare for and assist the passage of follow-on forces (if required). continue to improve security by conducting defensive actions. these defensive actions include ea development, direct fire planning, and battle position preparation. adjust fpf and register targets along likely mounted and dismounted avenues of approach. protect the obstacle reduction effort. secure epws and detainees. prepare for the enemy counterattack. offense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 2-49 reorganization 2-234. reorganization is usually conducted concurrently with consolidation. it comprises actions taken to prepare the sbct infantry rifle company for follow-on missions. as with consolidation, the sbct infantry rifle company commander plans and prepares for reorganization as he conducts his tlps. he ensures that the sbct infantry rifle company take the following actions: provide essential medical treatment and evacuate casualties, as needed. treat and evacuate wounded epws and detainees, and process the remainder of epws and detainees. cross-level personnel and adjust task organization when necessary to support the next phase or mission. conducts resupply operations, to include rearming and refueling. redistribute ammunition. conduct required maintenance. continue improvement of defensive positions, as needed. continuing operations 2-235. for all attacks, the sbct infantry rifle company should plan to exploit success. however, at the conclusion of an engagement, the commander may be forced to defend. units make use of the terrain to enhance their survivability for short defensive tasks. if a longer defense is envisioned, engineer assets immediately should shift the priority of their efforts to provide survivability support (fighting positions and similar activities). engineer assets should do this even as they sustain mobility and integrate countermobility into the planned defense. the sbct infantry rifle company commander considers the higher commander’s concept of operations, friendly capabilities, and the enemy situation when making the decision to defend or continue offensive tasks. transition to defensive tasks 2-236. as offensive tasks approach a culmination, the commander orders a transition to a defense. the commander uses two basic techniques when he transitions to the defense. the first technique requires the leading elements to commit forces and push forward to claim enough ground to establish a security area anchored on defensible terrain. the second technique is to establish a security area along the unit’s final positions, moving the main body rearward to defensible terrain. 2-237. the commander anticipating the termination of unit offensive actions prepares orders that include the time or circumstances under which the offense transitions to a defensive-focused mission, the missions and locations of subordinate units, and mission command measures. the commander takes the following actions as the unit transitions from an offensive to a defensive task: maintains contact and information collection on the enemy using a combination of reconnaissance units and surveillance assets to develop the situation and facilitate planning of future operations. establishes a security area and local security measures (to include biometric identity data collection) . redeploys indirect fire assets to ensure the support of security forces. redeploys forces based on probable future employment. maintains or regains contact with adjacent units in a contiguous ao and ensures that units remain capable of mutual support in a noncontiguous ao. transitions the engineer effort by shifting the emphasis from mobility to countermobility and survivability. consolidates and reorganizes. transition to stability tasks 2-238. upon order from higher headquarters, the commander orders a transition to operations focused on stability tasks. these tasks establish a safe, secure environment that facilitates reconciliation between local chapter 2 2-50 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016or regional threats. stability tasks aim to establish conditions that support the transition to legitimate hn governance, a functioning civil society, and a viable market econom y. 2-239. the sbct infantry rifle company commander ensures that contingencies are planned for to transition quickly from offensive to stability tasks and vice versa. for example, it may be wise for commanders to plan a defensive contingency with an on-order offensive mission for stability tasks that could deteriorate. 2-240. subordinate leaders need to be fully trained to recognize activities that would initiate this transition. actions in one unit’s ao can affect a change in whatever type task an adjacent unit is conducting. (for example, an offensive action may cause noncombatants to be displaced to another section of the city creating a need to support operation for the unit in that ao.) 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 3-1 chapter 3 defense a defensive task is a task conducted to defeat an enemy attack, gain time, economize forces, and develop conditions favorable for offensive or stability tasks (adrp 3-0) . the sbct infantry rifle company uses the defense to occupy and prepare positions and mass the effects of direct fires on likely approaches. the commander combines natural and man-made obstacles to canalize the attacking force into engagement areas. this chapter discusses the basics of the defense, defense of a linear object, perimeter defense, reverse slope defense, engagement area development, and transitions. section i – basics of the defense 3-1. as part of the higher echelon’s defensive tasks, the sbct infantry rifle company may defend, delay, withdraw, or counterattack. it may also perform security tasks for the sbct infantry battalion. the sbct infantry rifle company may defend as part of the higher headquarters’ main battle area, or it may conduct autonomous defensive or stability tasks within a small scale contingency. the sbcts infantry rifle company and its higher headquarters conduct operations to create conditions for success as enemy forces enter into the main battle area and by weakening the enemy prior to the commencement to close combat. 3-2. the sbct infantry rifle company usually defends in the main battle area. the sbct infantry battalion can conduct the defense to achieve one or more of the following actions: gain time. retain key terrain. support other missions. preoccupy the enemy in one area while friendly forces attack him in another. attrite enemy forces at a rapid rate while reinforcing friendly actions. characteristics of defense 3-3. successful defenses employ the characteristics of disruption, flexibility, maneuver, mass and concentration, operations in depth, preparation, and security. disruption 3-4. defenders subvert an attacker’s tempo, formations and synchronization by countering his initiative and preventing him from massing overwhelming combat power. disruption attacks the enemy’s will to fight and his means of effective command and control. deep precision fires, long-range precision sniper fires, electronic countermeasures (jamming), scatterable minefields (scatmine), unexpected defensive positions, local counterattacks at all levels, and attacks delivered by a reserve force, combine to disrupt the enemy’s attack and break his will to continue offensive operations. repositioning forces, implement aggressive protection measures, the employment of roadblocks, ambushes, checkpoints, and information operations combine to disrupt the threat of asymmetrical attack. these tasks disrupt enemy efforts to fight as a combined-arms team. flexibility 3-5. the defender gains flexibility by sound preparation and task organization, disposition in depth, retention of reserves, repositioning, and effective mission command. the defense is characterized by rapid, chapter 3 3-2 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016simultaneous, and collaborative planning with flexible execution. contingency planning permits flexibility. flexibility also requires that the commander see the battlefield to detect the enemy ’s scheme of maneuver early. intelligence preparation of the battlefield determines likely enemy actions; while security elements confirm or deny those actions. movement and maneuver 3-6. maneuver allows the commander to take full advantage of the ao and mass and concentrate fires when desirable. maneuver through movement in combination with fire, allows the commander to achieve a position of advantage over the enemy to accomplish the mission. it encompasses defensive actions such as security and support operations. massing effects 3-7. the company shapes and decides the battle by massing the effects of overwhelming combat power. effects are synchronized in time and space and should be rapid and unexpected so that they break the enemy’s offensive tempo and disrupt hi s attack. the company commander deploys his arrays his combat power based on his assessment of the intelligence provided and the latest information from reconnaissance in a manner that overwhelms the enemy and provides the greatest impact on their forces while negating the risks to his own units. this can occur at a single decisive point or through multiple incursions in depth to achieve disruptive, destructive, and decisive effects upon the enemy’s attack. operations in depth 3-8. integration of all combat power throughout the area of operation improves the chances for success while minimizing friendly casualties. quick, violent, and simultaneous action throughout the depth of the companies’ area of operations can attrite, confuse, and even degrade an enemy force when he is most exposed and vulnerable. such actions weaken the enemy’s morale and do not allow any early successes to build their confidence. operations in depth prevent the enemy from gaining momentum in the attack. synchronization of actions in deep, close, and security areas facilitate mission success. 3-9. alternate and supplementary positions, combat outposts, and mutually supporting strongpoint’s forward of the perimeter extend the depth. fires are planned throughout the defensive area up to the maximum range of available weapons and reconnaissance assets. fires move and reposition to maintain contact with enemy forces and observe nais in depth as the battle develops. during periods of reduced visibility, obstacles are emplaced around critical locations within the perimeter to disrupt the enemy’s plan, and add depth to the defense. preparation 3-10. the company commander determines likely enemy avenues of approach, likely enemy schemes of maneuver, where to kill the enemy, integration of obstacles, unit positioning, and integration of indirect fires, and he assigns missions accordingly. defensive preparations include the following: enact survivability measures that involve action against conventional threats (preparation of fighting positions, digging-in mission command nodes, and similar actions) as well as asymmetric threats (terrorist attacks and weapons of mass destruction employment). designate a reserve. conduct rehearsals to ensure synchronization. these include employment of the reserve and counterattack forces. position forces in depth. reinforce terrain with obstacles that support the scheme of maneuver. coordinate with assets forward in the battalion’s security area to gain combat information or early warning. security 3-11. security operations are measures normally taken by the sbct infantry battalion or higher echelons to protect itself against all acts designed to impair its effectiveness, and prevent the enemy from gaining an unexpected advantage. because the sbct infantry rifle company defends to conserve combat power for defense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 3-3 use elsewhere or later, commanders must secure the force. the battalion ensures security by employing reconnaissance elements throughout the entirety of its assigned ao. the battalion may employ a counterreconnaissance force, combat outposts, or a force conducting a screen to provide security. this force may be its scout platoon but can be one of its companies or elements of its companies depending on the level of security the battalion determines suitable to the threat. 3-12. information operations capabilities such as psychological operations, military deception, and electronic warfare (ew) can aid in securing the force and confuse the enemy as to the battalion’s manner of defense. the battalion integrates its security operations with those of the sbct and other adjacent or partnered units. defensive tasks 3-13. there are three basic defensive tasks —area defense, mobile defense, and retrograde. each of these tasks contains elements of the others, and usually contains both static and dynamic aspects. sbct infantry rifle companies serve as the primary maneuver elements, or terrain controlling units, for the sbct infantry battalion in all three defensive tasks. they can defend aos or positions, or they can serve as security forces or reserves as part of the sbct infantry battalions coordinated defense. (refer to adrp 3-90 for more information.) 3-14. as part of defensive tasks, the sbct infantry rifle company can defend, delay, withdraw, counterattack, and perform security tasks. the sbct infantry rifle company usually defends, as part of the sbct infantry battalion’s defense, in the main battle area (mba). the sbct infantry rifle company can conduct the defense to achieve one or more of the following actions: gain time. retain key terrain. support other missions. preoccupy the enemy in one area while friendly forces attack him in another. attrite enemy forces at a rapid rate while reinforcing friendly actions. area defense 3-15. the area defense is a defensive task that denies enemy forces access to designated terrain for a specific time rather than destroying the enemy outright (adrp 3-90). the emphasis is on retaining terrain where the bulk of the defending force positions itself in mutually supporting positions and controlling the terrain between positions. the defeat mechanism is fires into eas, which reserve units can supplement. the commander uses his reserve force to reinforce fires, add depth, block penetrations, restore positions, or counterattack to destroy enemy forces and seize the initiative. forms of defensive maneuver 3-16. there are two forms of defensive maneuver within an area defense —defense in depth and forward defense. the sbct infantry rifle company is expected to do both. while the sbct infantry battalion commander selects the type of area defense to use, the company commander often defines the general defensive scheme for the company. the specific mission may impose constraints such as time, security, and retention of certain areas that are significant factors in determining how the company will defend. defense in depth 3-17. a defense in depth reduces the risk of the attacking enemy force penetrating the defense quickly. the enemy is unable to exploit a penetration because of additional defensive positions employed in depth. the in-depth defense provides more space and time to defeat the enemy attack. 3-18. the sbct infantry rifle company uses a defense in depth when — the mission allows the sbct infantry rifle company to fight throughout the depth of the ao. the terrain does not favor a defense well forward, and there is better defensible terrain deeper in the ao. sufficient depth is available in the ao. chapter 3 3-4 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 cover and concealment forward in the ao is limited. weapons of mass destruction may be used. forward defense 3-19. the intent of a forward defense is to prevent enemy penetration of the defense. a forward defense is the least preferred due to its lack of depth. the sbct infantry rifle company deploys most of its combat power into forward defensive positions near the forward edge of the battle area (feba). while the sbct infantry battalion may lack depth, the rifle company and platoons build depth into the defense at their levels. the commander fights to retain its forward position, and may conduct counterattacks against enemy penetrations, or to destroy enemy forces in forward eas. often, counterattacks are planned forward of the feba to defeat the enemy. 3-20. the sbct infantry rifle company uses a forward defense when — terrain forward in the ao favors the defense. strong natural or man-made obstacles, such as a river or a rail line, are located forward in the ao. the assigned ao lacks depth due to the location of the area or facility to be protected. cover and concealment in the rear portion of the ao is limited. directed by higher headquarters to retain or initially control forward terrain. mobile defense 3-21. the mobile defense is a defensive task that concentrates on the destruction or defeat of the enemy through a decisive attack by a striking force (adrp 3-90). the mobile defense focuses on defeating or destroying the enemy by allowing enemy forces to advance to a point where they are exposed to a decisive counterattack by the striking force. the commander uses the fixing force to hold attacking enemy forces in position, to help channel attacking enemy forces into ambush areas, and to retain areas from which to launch the striking force. a mobile defense requires an ao of considerable depth. 3-22. the sbct infantry rifle c ompany’s mission in a mobile defense is either part of a fixing force or a striking force, but not both. as part of the fixing force, the sbct infantry rifle company defends within its assigned ao. as part of the striking force, the sbct infantry company plans, rehearses, and executes offensive tasks. note. units smaller than a division do not usually conduct a mobile defense because of their inability to fight multiple engagements throughout the width, depth, and height of their ao, while simultaneously resourcing the striking, fixing, and reserve forces. typically, the striking force in a mobile defense consists of one-half to two- thirds of the defender’s combat power. 3-23. the striking force is a committed force and has the resources to conduct a decisive counterattack as a part of the mobile defense. the striking force decisively engages the enemy as he becomes exposed in his attempts to overcome the fixing force. the striking force normally attacks a moving enemy force, and is usually armor heavy. retrograde 3-24. the retrograde is a type of defense task that involves organized movement away from the enemy (adrp 3-90). the enemy may force these actions or the commander may execute them voluntarily. in either case, the higher commander of the force executing the operation approves the retrograde. retrograde is conducted to improve a tactical situation or to prevent a worse situation from developing. companies usually conduct retrogrades as part of a larger force, but may conduct independent retrogrades when necessary such as on a raid. 3-25. retrograde can accomplish the following: resist, exhaust, and defeat enemy forces. draw the enemy into an unfavorable situation. avoid contact in undesirable conditions. defense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 3-5 gain time. secure more favorable terrain reposition forces, shorten lines of communication, or conform to movements of other friendly units. disengage a force from an ongoing mission for use elsewhere in other missions. 3-26. disengage is a tactical mission task where the commander has the unit break contact with the enemy to allow the conduct of another mission or to avoid decisive engagement ( fm 3-90-1). it involves moving t o a location where the enemy cannot engage the friendly force with either direct fires or observed indirec t fires. disengaging from the enemy while displacing from one position to the next is a difficult procedure. a disengagement plan includes the following : the maneuver concept of operations for tactical elements after disengagement, along with the movement routes for each subordinate unit. fires to suppress the enemy and cover the unit’s movement. screening smoke to conceal the unit’s movement, as part of a deception operation, or to cover passage points. contact and passage points if moving through friendly lines. the time disengagement starts. the earliest time that functional and multifunctional support and sustainment elements move. 3-27. there are three types of retrograde — delay. withdrawal. retirement. delay 3-28. delay is a task that allows the unit to trade space for time, avoiding decisive engagement and safeguarding its elements. delays gain time to — allow other friendly forces to establish a defense. cover a withdrawing force. protect a friendly force’s flank. allow other forces to counterattack. 3-29. the sbct infantry rifle company conducts delays by initiating and breaking contact with enemy forces with their infantry to prevent from being decisively engaged. this technique forces the enemy to deploy, and then reorganize to continue operations forcing them to use time to accomplish these tasks. the infantry keeps the stryker vehicle in close proximity but out of direct fire contact during the engagement. remounting the vehicle under direct fire should only be done if the enemy force can be suppressed with fires. remounting the vehicle is preferred to be done out of contact. the mgs platoon, mortar section can all assist the dismounted element break contact by means of direct and indirect fires. withdrawal 3-30. withdrawal is a task that the commander uses to break enemy contact, especially when he needs to free the unit for a new mission. there are two types of withdrawals, assisted, and unassisted. the commander’s intent and mett -tc determine which type of withdrawal the unit uses. assisted withdrawal 3-31. the assisting force occupies positions to the rear of the withdrawing unit and prepares to accept control of the situation. it can assist the withdrawing unit with route reconnaissance, route maintenance, direct and indirect fire support, and sustainment. both forces closely coordinate the withdrawal. unassisted withdrawal 3-32. the withdrawing unit establishes routes and develops plans for the withdrawal, then establishes security force as the rear guard while the main body withdraws. sustainment and protection elements chapter 3 3-6 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016usually withdraw first, followed by combat forces. the dlic disengages from the enemy and follows the main body to its final destination as the unit withdraws. retirement 3-33. retirement is a task that moves a force that is not in contact away from the enemy. a retiring unit organizes for combat but does not anticipate interference by enemy ground forces. typically, another unit’s security force covers the movement of one formation as the unit conducts a retirement. however, mobile enemy forces, unconventional forces, air strikes, air assaults, or long-range fires may attempt to interdict the retiring unit. the commander plans for enemy actions and organizes the unit to fight in self-defense. the commander usually conducts a retirement to reposition his forces for future actions or to accommodate the concept of the operation. units conduct retirements as tactical road marches where security and speed are the most important considerations. forms of the defense 3-34. the three forms of the defense (defense of a linear obstacle, perimeter defense, and reverse-slope defense) have special purposes and require special planning and execution. the three forms of the defense provide distinct advantages for the defender and its subordinate units and apply to the area defense and the operations of the fixing force during a mobile defense. (refer to fm 3-90-1 for additional information.) defense of a linear obstacle 3-35. a defense of a linear obstacle generally favors the use of a forward defense. maintaining the integrity of the linear obstacle is the key to this type of defense. the defending unit constructs obstacles to stop the enemy forces and channel them into planned engagement areas. when attacked, the defending force isolates the enemy, conducts counterattacks, and delivers fires onto the concentrated force to defeat attempts to breach the obstacle. 3-36. defense of a linear obstacle often is used as part of an economy of force measure. forces that can counterattack and destroy the enemy may not be available immediately; therefore, defending forces must be able to — detect enemy penetrations early enough so that local counterattacks can defeat them. defend after being isolated. use reconnaissance elements, sniper teams, and other elements to detect enemy forces and call in fires. bring the fight to the enemy side of the obstacle to destroy its forces and disrupt enemy preparations. use fires to their maximum effect. use its mobility to concentrate combat power. perimeter defense 3-37. a perimeter defense is a defense oriented in all directions the sbct infantry rifle company often use a perimeter defense when conducting operations in noncontiguous areas of operations. the perimeter defense presents no assailable flanks to the enemy and allows the defender to reinforce a threatened area rapidly. some disadvantages of a perimeter defense include its isolation and the vulnerability of its concentrated units to enemy fires. 3-38. the commander establishes a perimeter defense when the unit must hold critical terrain, such as a strong point, or when it must defend itself in areas where the defense is not tied in with adjacent units. units can organize a perimeter defense to accomplish a specific mission, such as protecting a base or providing immediate self-protection, such as during resupply operations when all-around security is required. during a perimeter defense, leaders at all levels ensure that — units physically tie into each other. direct fire weapons use flanking fire to protect the perimeter. field artillery and mortars are protected. defense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 3-7 pace communications systems are secure and redundant. obstacles are employed. final protective fires are established. reverse -slope defense 3-39. an alternative to defending on the forward slope of a hill is to defend on a reverse slope. the reverse-slope defense allows units to concentrate their direct fires into a relatively small area while being protected from the enemy’s direct observation and supporting fires. the defender can destroy the enemy’s isolated forward units through surprise and concentrated fires. the control of the forward slope is essential for success. gaining control of the forward slope can be done by using dominating terrain behind the defenders or with the use of stay behind forces, such as reconnaissance and sniper teams, that can observe and call in fires on the attackers. common defensive planning considerations 3-40. planning a defense is a complex effort requiring detailed planning and extensive coordination. in the defense, synchronizing the sbct infantry rifle company’s combat and supporting systems enables the commander to apply combat power against selected advancing enemy forces to unhinge the enemy commander’s plan and destroy his combined arms team. as a mission evolves, the commander knows he may need to shift his decisive and shaping operations to press the fight and keep the enemy off balance. the synchronization and coordination of activities within each warfighting function and between the various warfighting functions are critical to the success of the sbct infantry rifle company. mission command 3-41. the company commander describes his anticipated enemy actions integrated with the sbct infantry battalions ipb. the company level ipb and the sbct infantry battalion ipb should not differ significantly. the sbct infantry battalions ipb should give the sbct infantry rifle company commander a clear understanding of how the sbct infantry battalion commander envisions the enemy will fight, and the enemy’s plan for the operation. the sbct battalion commander and the bct commander usually define where and how they will defeat or destroy the enemy. the company commander refines where he will integrate the other warfighting functions into a coherent whole to mass the effects of combat power at the decisive place and time. (refer to adrp 6-0 for more information on mission command.) the company commander defines how he envisions the sbct rifle company will execute its portion of the brigade fight based off of the commander’s intent one and two levels up. movement and maneuver 3-42. effective weapons positioning is critical to the sbct infantry rifle company ’s success in the defense. company leadership should take advantage of the .50 cal and mk-19 on the rws by placing them in positions that do not expose the hull of the stryker vehicle but allow them to engage the enemy. stryker infantry squads should deploy their javelins from covered and concealed positions at maximum effective ranges away from their icvs to reduce armored vehicles ability to detect them. these positions are normally forward of the icv offset to the left or the right of the rws’s orientation towards a trp to avoid the icv’s surface danger zone ( sdz). effective weapons positioning enables the sbct rifle company to mass fires at critical points in the ao and shift fires as needed. the sbct infantry rifle company commander exploits the strengths of his weapons systems while minimizing the company ’s exposure to enemy observation and fires. 3-43. the company leadership should integrate icvs and infantry to support one another in the defense. the infantry should provide additional security in the defense from a mutually supporting position as well as local security. the icvs should support the infantry with use of it crew served weapons, ability to reposition forces quickly to alternate and subsequent positions, provide information updates and situational awareness with mission command systems, conduct emergency resupply, and casevac. 3-44. when the commander designates a reserve he positions the reserve in a location where it can effectively react to several contingency plans. he considers terrain, trafficability of roads, potential eas, probable points of enemy penetrations, and commitment time. the reserve should be positioned in a chapter 3 3-8 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016covered and concealed position. information concerning the reserve may be considered essential elements of friendly information (eefi) and protected from enemy reconnaissance. intelligence 3-45. the sbct infantry rifle company commander will never have all the intelligence he needs about the enemy. therefore, he with the coist obtains or develops the best possible ipb products and conducts continuous information collection and integrates new and updated intelligence throughout the mission. he may need to request intelligence from the battalion staff to answer pir that is integrated into specific nais . this allows the stryker infantry rifle company commander to decide where to place his information collection effort. (refer to atp 2-01.3 for more information.) 3-46. as with all tactical planning, ipb is a critical part of defensive planning. it helps the commander define where to concentrate combat power, where to accept prudent risk, and where to plan potential decisive operations. the ipb presents all feasible enemy coas to aid in the development of a flexible defensive plan. the essential areas are — analyze terrain and weather. determine enemy force size and likely coas with associated dps. determine enemy vulnerabilities and hvts. impact of civilian population on the defense. 3-47. the commander makes his determination of how and where to defeat the enemy on where he believes the enemy will go, the terrain, and the forces available. the sbct infantry battalion may define a defeat mechanism that includes the use of single or multiple counterattacks to achieve success. the company commander analyzes his unit’s role in the sbct infantry battalion fight to determine how to achieve success. fires 3-48. for the fire support plan to be effective in the defense, the sbct infantry rifle company plans and executes fires in a manner that achieves the intended task and purpose of each target. indirect fires serve a variety of purposes in the defense, to include the following: slow and disrupt enemy movement. prevent the enemy from breaching. destroy or delay enemy forces at obstacles using massed fires or precision munitions. disrupt enemy support-by -fire elements. defeat attacks along dismounted avenues of approach with the use of fpf. disrupt the enemy to enable friendly elements to disengage or conduct counterattacks. obscure enemy observation or screen friendly movement during disengagement and counterattacks. provide smoke screens to separate enemy echelons or to silhouette enemy formations to facilitate direct fire engagement. provide illumination, as needed. execute sead missions to support aviation missions. 3-49. the sbct infantry rifle company commander evaluates the air integration plan with indirect fire systems available to provide support when developing the fire plan. considerations, when developing the plan, include tactical capabilities, weapon’s ranges, available munitions, time on station, communication and control, airspace management, and marking of enemy and friendly units. these factors help the sbct infantry rifle company commander and fso determine the best method for achieving the task and purpose of each target in the fire plan. the rifle company’s fire support personnel contribut e significantly to the fight. effective positioning is critical. the company commander and company fso selects positions that provide fire support personnel with unobstructed observation of the ao and ensures survivability. they adjust indirect fires onto the targets, synchronize effects, assist to clear airspace and guide aircraft onto targets. defense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 3-9 sustainment 3-50. besides the sustainment functions required for all missions, the sbct infantry rifle company commander ’s planning process includes pre-positioning of ammunition caches, positioning of sbct rifle company trains, and class iv and v supply points and mine dumps, vehicle recovery and maintenance, and medevac and casevac. 3-51. the commander ’s mission analysis may reveal that the company ’s ammunition requirements during an upcoming mission exceed its basic load. this requires the company to preposition ammunition caches. the company usually positions ammunition caches at alternate or subsequent positions. the company may construct survivability positions to house these caches and guard them to prevent their capture or destruction by the enemy. 3-52. the sbct infantry rifle company train usually operates 500 to 1000 meters, or one terrain feature, to the rear of the company to provide immediate recovery and medical support. the company trains conduct evacuation (of those wounded in action [wia], weapons, and equipment) and resupply as required. the company trains are located in covered and concealed positions close enough to the company to provide responsive support, but out of enemy direct fire range. the 1sg or xo positions the trains and supervises sustainment. the sbct infantry rifle company commander ensures all elements know the casualty evacuation procedures and the locations of the battalion combat and field trains and the company ccp and battalion aid station (bas). the company commander ’s analysis determines the most effective measures for every mission, which includes the decision to evacuate or recover forward and consolidate based on the tactical situation. protection 3-53. air and missile defense (amd) support to the sbct infantry rifle company may be limited. units should hide from heavier enemy air threats such as rotary-wing, fixed-wing, or class iii unmanned aircraft system (uas) and use their organic weapons systems for self-defense against smaller enemy air threats such as class ii and below uas or lighter than air aircraft. they should plan for cbrn reconnaissance at likely locations for enemy employment of cbrn agents and hazards. they should use obscurants to support disengagement or movement of forces. they assign sectors of fire to prevent fratricide and friendly fire. 3-54. survivability construction includes fighting positions, protective positions, and hardening. these are prepared to protect vehicles, personnel, and weapons systems. positions can be constructed and reinforced with overhead cover to increase the survivability of dismounts and crew-served weapons against shrapnel from airbursts. vehicle fighting positions can be constructed with hull down observation positions. the sbct infantry rifle company may use digging assets for ammunition caches at alternate, supplementary, or subsequent positions. all leaders need to understand the survivability plan and priorities. typically, the engineer platoon leader cr eates a commander’s card if supporting the company, which enables the commander to track the survivability effort. one person in the company, usually the company xo or 1sg, is designated to enforce the plan and priorities, and to ensure that the completion status is accurately reported and tracked. additional p lanning considerations 3-55. additional defensive task planning considerations include missions in urban environment, mountain, and desert and jungle terrain as well as sniper employment. urban environment 3-56. company forces defend urban areas to defeat an attack, gain time, economize forces, protect infrastructure, protect a populace, and shape conditions for offensive or stability tasks. usually two or more of these tasks apply to the urban defense. defensive tasks in urban environment provide commanders with opportunities to turn the environment’s characteristics to the advantage of army forces. urban areas are ideal for defensive tasks and enhance the combat power of defending units. chapter 3 3-10 atp 3-21.11 4 february 20163-57. urban defensive success depends on synchronizing the following simultaneous operations as one action: decisive operation may not be effective if the tasks mentioned previously are not integrated into the overall mission plan. shaping operations vary greatly depending on the type of defense and create the conditions for decisive operations. sustaining operations ensure freedom of action, secure lines of communications, and establish movement control. 3-58. in a built-up area, the defender takes advantage of inherent cover and concealment afforded by the urban environment. stryker infantry rifle companies maximize the use of their task organization with nine dismounted infantry squads, three weapons squads, and a sniper section. they are able to engage at closer ranges to take advantage in close quarters combat. 3-59. the company commander considers restrictions to the attacker ’s ability to maneuver and observe. the stryker vehicles can be emplaced to provide blocking positions at intersections, streets, alley ways, and entrances to structures. by using the terrain and fighting from well-prepared and mutually supporting positions, a defending force can delay, block, fix, or destroy a much larger attacking force. the defense of a built-up area is organized around key terrain features, buildings, and areas that preserve the integrity of the defense and provide the defender with ease of movement to include above ground and subterranean areas. the defender organizes and plans his defense by observation and fields of fire, avenues of approach, key terrain, obstacles and movement, cover and concealment (oakoc). (refer to attp 3-06.11 for more information.) snipers in urban environment 3-60. historically, snipers have been especially useful in urban areas. they provide long- and short-range precision fires and help with company- and platoon-level isolation efforts. snipers provide valuable precision fires during stability tasks. along with engaging assigned targets, snipers are a valuable asset to the commander for providing observation along movement routes and suppressive fires during an assault. (refer to tc 3-22.10 for more information.) 3-61. the commander may assign the following tasks to snipers: conduct counter sniper operations. kill targets of opportunity. (the sniper team assigns priorities to these targets based on an understanding of the commander’s intent [for example, engaging enemy snipers, then leaders, vehicle commanders, radio men, sappers, and machine gun crews, in that order].) deny enemy access to certain areas or avenues of approach (control key terrain). provide fire support for barricades and other obstacles. maintain surveillance of flank and rear avenues of approach (screen). support local counterattacks with precision fire. defensive tasks in mountainous terrain 3-62. defensive tasks in a mountainous terrain are conducted to resist, defeat, or destroy an enemy attack to support subsequent offensive actions. commanders use defensive tasks to withstand an enemy attack while preparing to seize the initiative and develop conditions favorable for transitioning to the offense. during a defense, friendly forces withstand enemy attacks and hold the enemy while preparing to seize the initiative and transition to an attack or to conduct stability tasks. a thorough understanding of the commander ’s intent is especially critical in the defense, which demands precise integration of all assets to include maneuver and sustainment. 3-63. stryker forces operating in mountainous terrain environments often possess weapons and equipment more advanced in technology than the enemy. knowing this, enemy offensive tactics commonly involve short violent engagements followed by a hasty withdrawal through preplanned routes. the enemy often strikes quickly and fights only as long as the advantage of the initial surprise is in their favor. attacks may include direct fires, indirect fires, or improvised explosive devices (ieds) and may be against stationary or moving forces. (refer to attp 3-21.50 for more information.) in the defense of mountainous terrain, the defense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 3-11 stryker vehicles uses their mobility to maneuver to places of advantage, while the infantry secure severely restricted and key terrain. 3-64. the rws on stryker vehicle can take advantage of engaging targets that are in positions of elevation above them, thus allowing an engagement area with mounted forces shooting upward and infantry shooting downward. in severely restricted terrain the infantry can dismount the mk-19 or .50 cal from the rws to engage enemy from a position of tactical advantage. in this case the soldiers leave the icv in a hide position. desert terrain 3-65. in the desert terrain, the sbct infantry rifle company orients on primary enemy approaches in their assigned area of operation, units prepare for attack from any direction. it is neither possible nor necessary to have maximum firepower in all directions, move weapons to threatened areas before the enemy reaches them. air cover or an air defense umbrella is necessary for a successful defense. (refer to fm 90.3 for more information.) in general, some considerations for defensive tasks in a desert environment include, obstacles to site a defense are limited, and strong points to defend choke points and other key terrain, and mobility and sustainment are key factors. sbct should take advantage of reverse slope defenses when possible in desert environments to negate weapon ranges standoff. jungle terrain 3-66. jungle defensive operations are based on the same defense fundamentals used in other operations. some of the fundamentals, however, may acquire a special significance in the jungle. (refer to fm 90.5 for more information.) considerations for defensive operations in a jungle environment are limited visibility and fields of fire, limited and restricted maneuver. sniper employment 3-67. snipers play a vital role in the commander ’s planning and help the company maintain an offensive posture while in the defense. the sniper team can do the following in the defense: augment the fires of the company. cover avenues of approach, obstacles, dead space, and key terrain features. provide final protective fires, if necessary. deter enemy infiltration attempts. operate as an extension of patrols. 3-68. during defensive tasks in urban environment, sniper teams work outside the feba to provide early warning and disruption and, if possible, cause the enemy to deploy prematurely. sniper teams do the following in the defense: move out during limited visibility. build hide positions that overwatch likely avenues of approach and nais. provide early warning of impending attacks (day or night), probes, or infiltrations. reduce targets of opportunity. collect data. common defensive control measures 3-69. the commander uses control measures to control the defense and provide flexibility to respond to changes in the situation. control measures allow the defending commander to rapidly concentrate combat power at the decisive point. defensive control measures within the commander’s ao include designating the security area, the battle handover line (bhl), the mba with its associated feba, and the echelon support area. the commander can use battle positions and additional direct fire control and fire support coordination measures (fscm) to further synchronize the employment of combat power. the commander designates disengagement lines to trigger the displacement of subordinate forces. (refer to adrp 3-90 for more information.) chapter 3 3-12 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016battle handover line 3-70. the bhl is a designated pl on the ground where responsibility transitions from the stationary force to the moving force and vice versa. battle positions 3-71. a battle position (bp) is a defensive location oriented on a likely enemy avenue of approach. units as large as battalion task forces and as small as squads or sections use bps. they may occupy the topographical crest of a hill, a forward slope, a reverse slope, or a combination of these areas. the commander selects his positions based on terrain, enemy capabilities, and friendly capabilities. a commander can assign all or some subordinates bps within the ao. leaders within the company should manage integration of both mounted and dismounted forces to maximize the firepower of the two forces. infantry should be in close proximity of their stryker vehicles but far enough away from their weapons secondary effects, especially with the mgs vehicle (see appendix a). stryker vehicles wit h rws should take advantage of their battle positions by only exposing the rws allowing the remainder of the vehicle to remain safely behind cover. 3-72. there are five types of bps. they are as follows: primary positions cover the area where the commander intends to contain or destroy an enemy force (engagement area). (see figure 3-1 on -13 .) alternate positions are those assigned when the primary position becomes untenable or unsuitable for carrying out the assigned task. these positions allow the defender to carry out his original task. the following considerations apply for an alternate bp: it covers the same avenue of approach or sector of fire as the primary bp. it is located slightly to the front, flank, or rear of the primary bp. it may be positioned forward of the primary bp during limited visibility. it is employed to supplement or support positions with weapons of limited range, such as dismounted positions. subsequent positions are those to which the unit expects to move during the course of the battle. a defending unit may have a series of subsequent positions. subsequent positions can have primary, alternate, and supplementary positions associated with the m. supplementary position is a defensive position located within a unit ’s assigned ao that provides sectors of fire and defensible terrain along an avenue of approach that is not the enemy’s expected avenue of attack. (see figure 3-2 on -13.) for example, an avenue of approach into a company ’s ao from one of its flanks could require the company to direct its platoons (plts) to establish supplementary positions to allow the platoons to engage enemy forces traveling along that avenue. the platoon leader formally assigns supplementary positions when the platoon covers more than one avenue of approach. strong point is a heavily fortified bp tied to a natural or reinforcing obstacle to create an anchor for the defense or to deny the enemy decisive or key terrain. the mission to create and defend a strong point implies retention of terrain to stop or redirect enemy formations. strong points require extensive time, engineer support, and class iv resources to construct. a strong point is also used to — canalize enemy forces . canalize is a tactical mission task in which the commander restricts enemy movement to a narrow zone by exploiting terrain coupled with the use of obstacles, fires, or friendly maneuver. contain enemy forces. contain is a tactical mission task that requires the commander to stop, hold, or surround enemy forces or to cause them to center their activity on a given front and prevent them from withdrawing any part of their forces for use elsewhere. defense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 3-13 legend: bp = battle position figure 3-1. primary, alternate, and subsequent battle positions legend: bp = battle position figure 3-2. supplementary battle position chapter 3 3-14 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016forward edge of the battle area 3-73. the feba is the foremost limits of a series of areas in which ground combat units are deployed. excluded areas are those in which the covering or screening forces are operating, designated to coordinate fire support, the positioning of forces, or the maneuver of units. these units normally require no fire areas (nfas) placed over their position to prevent fratricide. main battle area 3-74. the mba is the area where the commander intends to deploy the bulk of the unit’s combat power and conduct decisive operations to defeat an attacking enemy. the defending commander‘s major advantage is the ability to select the ground on which the battle takes place. the defender positions subordinate forces in mutually supporting positions in depth to absorb enemy penetrations or canalize them into prepared eas, defeating the enemy‘s attack by concentrating the effects of over whelming combat power. the natural defensive strength of the position determines the distribution of forces in relation to both frontage and depth. defending units typically employ field fortifications and obstacles to improve the terrain‘s natural defensi ve strength. the mba includes the area where the defending force creates an opportunity to deliver a decisive counterattack to defeat or destroy the enemy. section ii – defense of a linear obstacle 3-75. area defense is preferred in defense of a linear obstacle because it accepts less risk by not allowing the enemy to cross the obstacle. linear obstacles such as mountain ranges or river lines favor a forward defense rather than a defense in depth. in a forward defense the linear obstacle may force the enemy force s to slow down, stop, mass, or canalize during their attempt to cross the linear obstacle providing an opportunity for the defending force to strike the enemy force. 3-76. the commander’s use of a defense in depth accepts the possibility that the enemy may forc e a crossing at a given point within an area defense. the depth of the defense should prevent the enemy from rapidly exploiting its success. it defuses the enemy‘s combat power by forcing the enemy to contain bypassed friendly defensive positions besides continuing to attack positions in greater depth. plan 3-77. planning for a defense of a linear obstacle requires a thorough ipb analysis during the planning phase. anticipation of how the enemy will react when it encounters the linear obstacle requires detailed analysis and understanding. determining the enemy coa either by information analysis, surveillance and reconnaissance or by answering pir is desired to complete the plan. by identifying the enemy coa it allows the company to mass effective fires on the enemy force. 3-78. a defensive plan should be more flexible when there is less information of the enemy coa. a flexible plan can impact the task organization of forces. techniques for the commander are as follows: attach an mgs or atgm vehicle to each of the infantry platoons to allow them greater fire power. keep the mgs platoon as a reserve or strike force to deploy to the decisive point to engage the enemy. assign the mgs or atgm platoon and stryker vehicles an area that allows them the ability to engage with long er ranges of their weapon systems . emplacing obstacles in front of the bridgehead of the linear obstacle to block enemy. normally, attached engineers will conduct this task with scatterable mine field. emplacing obstacles behind the bridgehead to separate or disrupt enemy forces. normally, supported field artillery will conduct this task with family of scatterable mines (fascam). attaching sniper team to an infantry squad in an op forward of the main defensive area to provide early warning. supporting or having the sbct infantry battalion scout platoon operating forward of your defensive position. defense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 3-15 prepare 3-79. preparing for the defense begins with the assembling of the company task organization to include enabling forces such as engineers, antiarmor company attachments, reconnaissance and security assets, or other elements. attachments should be briefed on how the commander intends to defend his area. attachments need to brief the commander on their status and capabilities and to ensure they can complete the commander’s intent , and if possible enhance the defensive scheme of maneuver by adding considerations and recommendations that the commander may not be aware of. tlps need to be completed and the company opord needs to be briefed to all involved. once attachments have been integrated into the company they need to be assigned and linked up with the platoons or other members of the company to maneuver to their assigned area and begin setting up the defense. 3-80. securing additional material such as additional class iv and v is next in the prepare phase. material should then be distributed to the operational elements to begin preparation of additional obstacles to enhance the defense of the linear obstacle, prepositioning other classes of supply, construction, and continual improvement of current, alternate, supplementary, and subsequent battle positions, and so forth, from the established priorities of work. emphasis should be placed on security because of enemy’s capability of reconnaissance assets or forces that either identify the defensive positions or disrupt the preparation of the defense. techniques for security during preparation may include assigning a security force to establish ops, patrols, sniper engagements, or a platoon conducting a screen or ambush . 3-81. the stryker company commander receives constant status updates of defensive preparations and performs quality control of the company’s defensive preparations. monitoring progress is key to ensure that the commander’s intent is met. preparing the defense should be continuous until the moment of execution. 3-82. rehearsals at all levels are conducted in the preparation phase and include combined arms rehearsal, fires, and sustainment. preparation in the defense is a continuous effort that can always be improved upon. fatigue from preparation can become a factor and the commander must consider a rest plan as part of the preparation so that soldiers are capable of fighting in the defense. execute 3-83. execution begins with warning or contact with the enemy force. warning can come from the adjacent, higher, or your own forces. the company can make enemy contact by any of the eight forms of contact that apply to the enemy. that contact allows the defending company to know where at least a portion of the attacking enemy is currently positioned. that contact can allow the enemy to know where a portion of the defending company is located. when the warning of enemy is received it needs to immediately disseminate and the defense needs to begin. 3-84. key to the defense scheme of maneuver is the identification of the enemy coa. adjustments to the enemy c oa from the commander’s scheme of maneuver needs to be controlled with mission command. actions on contact need to yield actionable information that the company/team can react to. effective fires, mass of combat forces and engagement/disengagement need to be executed. the company should try to force the enemy into its engagement areas, reinforce fires, add depth, block penetrations, restore positions, or counter attack to destroy enemy forces and seize the initiative. assess 3-85. assessment is continuous throughout the completion of prepare and execution phases. the stryker company commander’s assessment reveals threats to the chosen defensive scheme, suggests improvements to effectiveness, and reveals opportunities. the company commander determines the differences (variances) between the actual situation and what the original defensive scheme forecasted the situation would be at any given time based on the commander’s own observations and reports from the company’s subordinate organic units and any attachments. the commander’s evaluation of these variances considers whether the desired conditions have changed, are no longer achievable, or are not achievable if the company continues to execute the original defensive scheme. the commander makes adjustments to that defensive scheme and issues the necessary oral orders (see figure 3-3). these adjustments may have been previously developed as part of a previously developed decision support template. they include assigning chapter 3 3-16 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016new tasks to subordinates, reprioritizing support, and significantly modifying the chosen defensive course of action. legend: ea = engagement area, fpf = final protective fire, fascam = family of scatterable mines, mgs = mobile gun system, nai = named area of interest figure 3-3. defense of a linear obstacle section iii – perimeter defense 3-86. a perimeter defense is a defense oriented in all directions. the sbct infantry rifle company uses it for self-security, and to protect other units located within the perimeter. the sbct rifle company can employ a perimeter defense in urban or woodland terrain. in terms of positioning forces, weapons emplacement, direct and indirect fire integration, and reserve employment, the commander conducting a perimeter defense plans to respond to the widest possible range of enemy actions. the sbct infantry rifle company might be called upon to execute the perimeter defense under a variety of conditions, including — defense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 3-17 when it secures itself against attacks in an urban area. this technique may apply if the company conserves or builds combat power to execute offensive or patrolling. when it holds critical terrain in areas where the defense is not tied in with adjacent units. when it has been bypassed and isolated by the enemy and when to defend in place. when it conducts occupation of an independent assembly area or reserve position. when it begins preparation of a strong point. when it is directed to concentrate fires into two or more adjacent avenues of approach. 3-87. the commander should consider the following while in a perimeter defense: placing security as far out as possible. maximize the use of optics and sensors to provide early warning. positioning antiarmor weapons and mgs vehicles in protected positions, and concentrating their fires on armor avenues of approach and related ea s. building protected positions that allow the rws to engage targets without exposing the hull of the stryker vehicle. maintaining a reserve, usually a squad-size element with their stryker vehicle for a company. retention of key terrain. location of the reserve and criteria to deploy them. mission control. sustainment operations and sustainment security. planning and prepari ng 3-88. planning for a perimeter defense can be deliberate or executed as a battle drill to be utilized on command. estimated time spent occupying a location of the perimeter defense determines the level of planning and coordination involved. the longer the time of occupation the more built up the defensive perimeter should be. an example of a long term perimeter defense is a combat outpost that requires barriers, structures, additional communication assets, and engineer support. hasty perimeter defense can be established quickly during security halts by forming a perimeter with stryker vehicles. preparing a perimeter defense is a continuous ongoing task that is conducted with the company commander establishing priorities of work. perimeter defenses are prepared in this order: reconnaissance of the area to defend. occupation of the area. establish security. begin priorities of work. executing 3-89. the company commander organizes his forces according to the perimeter defense plan (see figure 3-4). he places his most casualty producing weapon system first at the most likely enemy avenue of approach and tries to use the maximize effective the range of the mgs. the remainder of the stryker vehicles forms a perimeter in their assigned areas. infantry establish defensive positions to ensure that the perimeter is completely covered 360 degrees. normally, infantry seek higher ground forward of their icv to provide better security to their position. they emplace their javelins and use the optics on the clu to increase their site range . the mortar section and company headquarters section usually locate in the center of the perimeter. the mortar section establishes a mortar fire position (mfp) with its dismounted 60-mm mortars and mounted 120-mm mortars. once the perimeter is formed and the commander establishes his priorities of work, he can begin to send out security patrols. assessing 3-90. adjustments in the perimeter are constant to ensure the security. the leaders should constantly check, inspect and update the perimeter defense plan. all adjustments need to be communicated to the commander. he is responsible for the coordination of the perimeter. chapter 3 3-18 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 legend: ea = engagement area, trp = target reference point figure 3-4. perimeter defense section iv – reverse-slope defense 3-91. an alternative to defending on the forward slope of a hill or a ridge is to defend on a reverse slope. in such a defense, the sbct infantry rifle company is deployed on terrain that is masked from enemy direct fire and ground observation by the crest of a hill. although some units and weapons might be positioned on the forward slope, the crest, or the counterslope (a forward slope of a hill to the rear of a reverse slope), most forces are on the reverse slope. the key to this defense is control of the crest by direct fire. 3-92. the commander can adopt a reverse slope position wh en— enemy fire makes the forward slope untenable. lack of cover and concealment on the forward slope makes it untenable. defense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 3-19 the forward slope has been lost or has not yet been gained. the forward slope is exposed to enemy direct fire weapons fired from beyond the effective range of the defender ’s weapons. moving to the reverse slope removes the attacker ’s standoff advantage. the terrain on the reverse slope provides better fields of fire than the forward slope. the defender avoids creating a dangerous salient or reentrant in friendly lines. surprising and deceiving the enemy as to the true location of the sbct infantry battalion defensive positions is essential. 3-93. when executing a reverse slope defense, the sbct infantry rifle company commander places special emphasis on — a fire support plan to prevent the enemy’s occupation and use of the crest of the hill. the use of ops or reconnaissance elements on the forward slope to provide observation across the entire front and security to the main battle positions. a counterattack plan that specifies measures necessary to clear the crest or regain it from the enemy. fire support to destroy, disrupt, and attrite enemy forces on the forward slope. 3-94. the forward edge of the position should be within small arms range of the crest. it should be far enough from the crest that fields of fire allow the defender time to place well-aimed fire on the enemy before he reaches friendly positions. the company can deploy the sniper team or establish ops on or forward of the topographical crest. this allows long-range precision fires, observation, and early warning over the entire front and indirect fire coverage of forward obstacles. ops are usually provided by the unit that owns the terrain being observed, and may vary in size from a few soldiers to a reinforced squad. they should include fos; their number should be increased to improve security at night. special c onsiderations 3-95. the following are considerations that commanders may apply when defending on a reverse slope: observation of the enemy is more difficult. soldiers in this position see forward no farther than the crest. this makes it hard to determine exactly where the enemy is as he advances, especially when visibility is poor. ops are placed forward of the topographic crest for early warning and long-range observation. displacing from the reverse slope defense is difficult because the defender must move up a hill. the defender is decisively engaged in a reverse slope defense. fields of fire are usually short negating weapon range advantages. normally, the defender has the opportunity to engage with direct fire weapon systems first. obstacles on the forward slope can be covered only with indirect fire or by units on the flanks of the company unless some weapons systems are initially placed forward. if the enemy gains the crest, he can assault downhill. this may give him a psychological advantage. if ops are insufficient or improperly placed, the defenders might have to fight an enemy who suddenly appears in strength at close range. 3-96. the slope degrades the enemy from being able to conduct reconnaissance and retreat if committed to an attack. the stryker vehicles can provide direct fire with their mounted crew served weapons and maneuver to positions of tactical advantage. (see figure 3-5.) chapter 3 3-20 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 legend: ea = engagement area figure 3-5. reverse slope considerations plan 3-97. planning for a reverse slope defense will require thorough ipb analysis during the planning phase. anticipation of how the enemy will react when it encounters the defense requires detailed analysis and understanding. making a defensive plan will require determining where the enemy descends either by combat information, reconnaissance, or intelligence. by identifying where the enemy descends allows the company commander time to mass effective fires on the enemy force. prepare 3-98. preparing for the reverse slope defense begins with the assembling of the company task organization and the completion of tlps. strong emphasis should be placed on concealing defensive positions, channeling the enemy into eas, and blocking attempts to occupy dead space by emplacing obstacles and covering with indirect fires. execute 3-99. execution begins with warning or contact with the enemy force. warning can come from the adjacent, higher, or organic forces. ideally direct fire contact should be initiated by friendly forces, due to the close proximity of the enemy forces in a reverse slope defense (see figure 3 -6 on -21). the commander should quickly assess his defensive plan if an enemy force initiates contact. defense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 3-21 legend: ea = engagement area, mgs = mobile gun system, pl = phase line, trp = target reference point figure 3-6. sbct example of a reverse slope note. figure 3-6 scenario — the company commander places the sniper team, mgs platoon, and a stryker infantry rifle platoon forward. the forward infantry platoon splits into sections, dismount, and secure the high ground on the flanks of the mgs platoon. they engage the enemy in engagement area ( ea) alpha to draw them in. on order, the forward element disengages and repositions. the stryker infantry rifle platoon consolidates in its secondary position. the mgs platoon moves to a reserve or striker force behind the second hill. the company engages the remaining enemy force in eas echo, omega, and zulu in a reverse slope defense. (see figure 3-7 on -23 .) chapter 3 3-22 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016assess 3-100. assessment is continuous throughout the completion of prepare and execution phases. identification of commander’s critical information requirement ( ccir ) assists the assessments with the decision support templates or the commanders’ orders. assessment will force the commander to determine commitment of the reserve force, engagement/break contact, consolidate and reorganize, counterattack, or recommend pursuit. section v – engagement area d evelopment 3-101. the ea is where the commander intends to trap and destroy an enemy force using the massed fires of all available weapons. by studying the terrain, the commander tries to determine the principal enemy and friendly heavy, light, and air avenues of approach. the commander determines the most advantageous area for the enemy’s main attack, as well as other mission variables of observation and fields of fire, avenues of approach, key terrain, obstacles, and cover and concealment (oakoc). (see a tp 3-34.80 for a detailed discussion of oakoc.) 3-102. the success of any engagement depends on how effectively the commander can integrate the obstacle plan, the indirect fire plan, and the direct fire plan within the ea to achieve the sbct infantry rifle company’s tactic al purpose. 3-103. at the company level, ea development is a complex function, demanding parallel planning and preparation if the company is to accomplish the tasks for which it is responsible. despite this complexity, ea development resembles a drill in that the commander and his subordinate leaders use an orderly, fairly standard set of procedures. the steps of ea development are not a rigid sequential process; some steps may occur simultaneously to ensure the synergy of combined arms. the development process covers these steps beginning with evaluation of mett-tc variables: identify all likely enemy avenues of approach. determine likely enemy schemes of maneuver. determine where to kill the enemy. plan and integrate obstacles. emplace weapons systems. plan and integrate indirect fires. rehearse the execution of operations in the ea. identify likely enemy avenues of approach 3-104. the company commander and the coist, if available, can use the following techniques and considerations when identifying the enemy ’s likely avenues of approach (see figure 3-7 on -23): conduct initial reconnaissance of the terrain using oakoc. if possible, do this from the enemy ’s perspective along each avenue of approach into the sector of fire or ea. fbcb2 can graphically assist the company commander by building a modified combined obstacle overlay (mcoo). identify key and decisive terrain. this includes locations that afford positions of advantage over the enemy, and natural obstacles and choke points that restrict forward movement. determine which avenues provide cover and concealment for the enemy while allowing him to maintain his tempo. fbcb2 can graphically assist the company commander by showing line of sight data. determine which terrain the enemy is likely to use to support each avenue. evaluate lateral routes adjoining each avenue of approach. defense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 3-23 legend: aa = avenue of approach figure 3-7. likely enemy avenues of approach determine enemy scheme of maneuver 3-105. the sbct infantry rifle company commander and coist, if available, can use the following considerations when determining the enemy’s scheme of maneuver (see figure 3-8): determine how the enemy will structure the attack. determine how the enemy will use his reconnaissance assets. will he attempt to infiltrate friendly positions? determine where and when the enemy will change formations or establish support by fire positions. determine where, when, and how the enemy will conduct his assault or breaching operations. determine where and when he will commit follow-on forces. determi ne the enemy’s expected rates of movement. assess the effects of his combat multipliers, the anticipated locations, and areas of employment. determine what reactions the enemy is likely to have in response to projected friendly actions. chapter 3 3-24 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 legend: aa = avenue of approach, pl = phase line, pld = probable line of deployment figure 3-8. example enemy scheme determine where to engage the enemy 3-106. the following steps identify and mark where the sbct infantry rifle company will engage the enemy (see figure 3-9 on -25): identify trps that match the enemy’s scheme of maneuver allowing the sbct infantry rifle company to identify where it will engage enemy forces through the depth of the sector of fire. identify and record the exact location, composition, and intent of each trp. trps within the sbct can be of different composition because of the use of different weapon systems to engage different types of targets. for example thermal sights are used to ensure visibility at the appropriate range under varying conditions when marking trps from mgs and rws. daylight and limited visibility trps can be used by infantry for because of their weapon sights. determine how many weapons systems will engage fires on each trp to achieve the desired end state. determine engagement lines for all weapons systems. determine which platoons will mass fires on each trp. defense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 3-25 establish eas around trps. develop the direct fire planning measures necessary to fire at each trp. legend: ea = engagement area, pl = phase line, pld = probable line of deployment, trp = target reference point figure 3-9. where to engage the enemy plan and integrate obstacles 3-107. the following steps apply in planning and integrating obstacles in the sbct infantry rifle company defense (see figure 3-10 ): determine the obs tacle group’s intent confirming the target, relative location, and effect. ensure intent supports the task force scheme of maneuver. identify, site, and mark the obstacles within the obstacle group. integrate protective obstacle types and locations within sbct infantry rifle company defense. ensure coverage of all obstacles with direct fires. assign responsibility for guides and lane closure, as required. emplace obstacles based on analysis of the mission variables of mett-tc, secure class iv and v point, secure mine dump, or secure obstacle work sites. chapter 3 3-26 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016coordinate engineer disengagement criteria, actions on contact, and security requirements with the engineer platoon leader at the obstacle work site if the company is supported by an engineer platoon. lege nd: ea = engagement area, pl = phase line, pld = probable line of deployment, trp = target reference point figure 3-10 . integrate obstacles emplace weapons systems 3-108. the following steps apply when selecting and improving bps and emplacing the sbct infantry rifle companies vehicles, crew-served weapons systems, and infantry positions (see figure 3-11 on -27): select tentative platoon bps. note. when possible, select these while moving in the ea. using the enemy’s perspective enables the commander to assess survivability of the positions. conduct a leader’s reconnaissance of the tentative bps. drive the ea to confirm that selected positions are tactically advantageous. defense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 3-27 confirm and mark the selected bps. ensure that bps do not conflict with those of adjacent units and that they are effectively tied in with adjacent positions. select primary, alternate, and supplementary fighting positions to achieve the desired effect for each ea. ensure that platoon leaders, psgs, vehicle commanders, or infantry squad leaders position weapons systems so that each ea is effectively covered by the required number of weapons, vehicles, or platoons. ensure that positions allow vehicle commanders, loaders, or gunners (as applicable for each vehicle or weapons system) to observe the ea and engage enemy forces from the hull down position. stake vehicle or weapons system positions according to unit sop so that the vehicle or weapon system positions can be hardened by the construction of fighting or survivability positions. confirm all vehicle or weapons system positions. legend: ea = engagement area, pl = phase line, pld = probable line of deployment, trp = target reference point figure 3-11 . emplace weapons systems chapter 3 3-28 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016plan and integrate indirect fires 3-109. the following steps apply in planning and integrating indirect fires (see figure 3-12): determine the purpose of fires. determine where that purpose will best be achieved. establish the observation plan with redundancy for each target. observers will include the fist and members of maneuver elements with fire support responsibilities. establish triggers based on enemy movement rates. obtain accurate target locations using survey or navigational equipment. refine target locations to ensure coverage of obstacles. adjust artillery and mortar targets. plan fpf. request critical friendly zone (cfz) for maneuver units and no fire areas ( nfa s) for ops and forward positions. legend: ea = engagement area, fpf = final protective fire, pl = phase line, pld = probable line of deployment, trp = target reference point figure 3-12 . integrate indirect fires defense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 3-29 engagement area rehearsal 3-110. the purpose of this rehearsal is to ensure that every leader and soldier understands the plan and that elements are prepared to cover their assigned areas with direct and indirect fires. although the sbct infantry rifle company commander has several options, the most common and most effective type is the mounted rehearsal. one technique for the mounted rehearsal in the defense is to have the sbct infantry rifle company trains, under the control of the company xo, move through the ea to depict the enemy force while the commander and subordinate platoons rehearse the operation from the company bp. the rehearsal should cover the following actions: rearward passage of security forces (as required). closure of lanes (as required). movement from the hide position to the bp. use of fire commands, triggers, or maximum engagement lines (mel) to initiate direct and indirect fires. shifting of fires to concentrate and redistribute fire effects. preparation and transmission of critical reports using fm and digital systems (as applicable). assessment of enemy weapons systems effects. displacement to alternate, supplementary, or subsequent bps. cross-leveling or resupply of class v. evacuation of casualties. 3-111. the sbct infantry rifle company commander should coordinate the rehearsal with the sbct infantry battalion to ensure that other units’ rehearsals do not conflict with his own. coordination leads to efficient use of planning and preparation time for all sbct infantry battalion units. it eliminates the danger of misidentification of friendly forces in the rehearsal area, which could result in fratricide. section vi – transitions 3-112. during the planning for any operation, the commander discerns the follow-on missions from the higher headquarters’ opord and begin s to plan how they intend to achieve them. the sbct infantry rifle company pauses to consolidate and reorganize before the next operation. if required, the commander decides the best time and location that facilitates future operations and provides security. (refer to fm 3-90-1 for more information.) conso lidation 3-113. the company commander plans and prepares for this phase of the operation as part of his tlps for the entire mission. he ensures that the company is ready to conduct the following actions that usually are part of consolidation: eliminate enemy resistance on the objective. establish security beyond the objective by securing areas that may be the source of enemy direct fires or enemy artillery observation. establish additional security measures such as ops and patrols. prepare for and assist the passage of follow-on forces (if required). continue to improve security by conducting other necessary defensive actions. these defensive actions include ea development, direct fire planning, and bp preparation. adjust fpf and register targets along likely mounted and dismounted avenues of approach. protect the obstacle reduction effort. secure epw and detainees. prepare for the enemy counterattack. chapter 3 3-30 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 reorganization 3-114. reorganization usually is conducted concurrently with consolidation. it consists of actions taken to prepare the sbct infantry rifle company for follow-on operations. as with consolidation, the company commander plans and prepares for reorganization as he conducts his tlps. he ensures that the company takes the following actions: provide essential medical treatment and arrange for medevac of the sick, injured, and wounded as needed. treat and evacuate wounded epws and detainees and process the remainder of epws and detainees. cross-level personnel and adjust task organization when necessary to support the next phase or mission. conducts resupply operations, to include rearming and refueling. redistribute ammunition and other supplies. conduct required maintenance. continue improvement of defensive positions, as needed. continuing operations 3-115. the sbct infantry rifle company may continue the defense, or if ordered, transition to focus on the conduct of offensive or stability tasks at the conclusion of an engagement. the commander considers the higher commander’s concept of operations, friendly capabilities, and the enemy situation when making this decision. all missions should include plans for exploiting success or assuming a defense. transition to retrograde 3-116. a defending commander may transition from participating in a higher echelon’s area or mobile defense to the retrograde as a part of continuing operations. a retrograde usually involves a combination of delay, withdrawal, and retirement operations. these operations may occur simultaneously or sequentially. as in other operations, the commander’s concept of operations and intent drive planning for retrograde operations. each form of retrograde operation has its unique planning considerations, but considerations common to all retrograde operations are risk, the need for synchronization, and rear operations. transition to offense 3-117. higher headquarters may order the sbct infantry rifle company to conduct an attack, movement to contact, or participate in exploitation. in some cases, the defensive tasks might immediately transition into a pursuit. 3-118. the company may execute a counterattack to destroy exposed enemy elements and free decisively engaged friendly elements. a base of fire element suppresses or fixes the enemy force while the counterattack (maneuver) element moves on a concealed route to a subsequent battle position to engage the enemy in the flank or rear. the counterattack element maneuvers rapidly to its firing position, often fighting through enemy flank security elements, to complete the counterattack before the enemy can bring follow-on forces forward to influence the fight. 3-119. execution of the counterattack is similar to that for an attack by fire. planning and preparation considerations for the counterattack vary depending on the purpose and location of the operation. (for example, the counterattack may be conducted forward of friendly positions, requiring the reserve force to move around friendly elements and through their protective and tactical obstacles.) in other situations, the commander may use a counterattack by fire to block, fix, or contain a penetration. in any case, the reserve force conducts the counterattack as an enemy-oriented operation. defense 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 3-31 transition to operation focused on s tability tasks 3-120. the sbct infantry rifle company commander should plan a defensive contingency with on-order offensive missions in an operation focused on stability tasks that could deteriorate. subordinate leaders need to be fully trained to recognize activities that would initiate this transition such as the disbandment of government or conventional security forces . 3-121. company commanders and soldiers need to be aware that elements of the bct could be conducting offensive, defensive, and stability tasks simultaneously within a small radius of each other. roe is assessed, updated, disseminated, and trained on while this transition occurs. establishing security within the area of operation for civilian population may call for a rapid response and initiative. the st ryker infantry rifle company makes these transitions rapidly through dissemination of information with mission command systems, leadership that takes the initiative, and active reconnaissance. this page intentionally left blank. 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 4-1 chapter 4 stability stability components of operations leverage the coercive and constructive capabilities of the military force to establish a safe and secure environment, facilitate reconciliation between local or regional adversaries; establish political, legal, social, and economic institutions; and facilitate the transition of responsibility to a legitimate civil authority. this chapter discusses sbct infantry rifle company role in support to stability tasks. it addresses sbct infantry rifle company, planning and operations considerations, and transitions. section i – overview of stability 4-1. stabilization is the process by which underlying tensions that might lead to resurgence in violence and a breakdown in law and order are managed and reduced, while efforts are made to support preconditions for successful long-term development (adrp 1-02). stability operations encompass various military missions, tasks, and activities conducted outside the united states in coordination with other instruments of national power to maintain or reestablish a safe and secure environment; provide essential governmental services, emergency infrastructure reconstruction, and humanitarian relief (jp 3-0). stability framework 4-2. a stability framework based on conditions within the area of operations of initial response, transformation, and fostering stability, helps the unit determine the required training and task organization of forces prior to initial deployment, and serves as a guide to actions in an operation focused on stability tasks. (refer to atp 3-07.5 for more information.) stability tasks occur in three phases described in the following paragraphs. these phases facilitate identifying lead responsibilities and determining priorities and describe the conditions on the operational environment. initial r esponse p hase 4-3. these actions generally reflect activity executed to stabilize a crisis state in the area of operations. army conventional force units typically perform initial response actions during, or directly after, a conflict or disaster in which the security situation prohibits the introduction of civilian personnel. initial response actions aim to provide a secure environment that allows relief forces to attend to the immediate humanitarian needs of the local population. they reduce the level of violence and human suffering while creating conditions that enable other actors to participate safely in relief efforts. transformation p hase 4-4. stabilization, reconstruction, and capacity-building are transformation phase actions that are performed in a relatively secure environment. transformation phase actions take place in either crisis or vulnerable states. there is the presence of a legitimate authority either interim or established as well as indigenous host nation security forces. these actions aim to build host-nation capacity across multiple sectors. transformation phase actions are essential to the continuing stability of the environment. these actions are essential to fostering stability within the area. fostering sustainability p hase 4-5. these are actions that encompass long-term efforts, which capitalize on capacity building and reconstruction activities. successful accomplishment of these actions establishes conditions that enable sustainable development. usually military forces perform fostering sustainability phase actions only when the security environment is stable enough to support efforts to implement the long-term programs that chapter 4 4-2 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016commit to the viability of the institutions and economy of the host nation. often military forces conduct these long-term efforts to support broader, civilian-led efforts. stability principles 4-6. the sbct applies stability principles to conduct their operations. the sbct infantry rifle company must understand the stability principles as they guide the higher commander intent for operations that they participate in. conflict transformation 4-7. conflict transformation is the process of converting the actors and conditions that motivate violent conflict into the governmental process to address the causes of instability (adrp 3-07). it aims to set the host nation on a sustainable, positive trajectory in which transformational processes directly address the dynamics causing instability. unity of effort 4-8. military operations typically demand unity of command, the challenge for military and civilian leaders is to forge unity of effort or unity of purpose among the diverse array of actors involved in a stability operation. this is the essence of unified action : the synchronization, coordination, and integration of the activities of governmental and nongovernmental entities with military operations to achieve unity of effort (jp 1). unity of effort is the coordination and cooperation toward common objectives, even if the participants are not necessarily part of the same command or organization which is the product of successful unified action (jp 1). unity of effort is fundamental to successfully incorporating all the instruments of national power in a collaborative approach when conducting stability tasks in operations. legitimacy and host-nation ownership 4-9. legitimacy is a condition based upon the perception by specific audiences of the legality, morality, or rightness of a set of actions, and of the propriety of the authority of the individuals or organizations in taking them. legitimacy enables host-nation ownership by building trust and confidence among the people. the principle of legitimacy impacts every aspect of operations from every conceivable perspective. legitimacy of the host-nation government and mission enables successful operations characterized by stability tasks. building partner capacity 4-10. building partner capacity is the outcome of comprehensive inter-organizational activities, programs, and military-to -military engagements that enhance the ability of partners to establish security, governance, economic development, essential services, and other critical government functions. brigades apply a comprehensive approach to sustained engagement with foreign and domestic partners to co-develop mutually beneficial capabilities and capacities to address shared global interests. unified action is an indispensable feature of building partner capacity. in operations characterized by stability tasks, unified action to enhance the ability of partners for security, governance, economic development, essential services, and other critical government functions exemplifies building partner capacity. stability tasks 4-11. army forces conduct the following five primary stability tasks: establish civil security, establish civil control, restore essential services, support to governance, and support to economic and infrastructure development. at brigade level and below, the primary stability tasks are too broad to direct effort to execute independently. they require partnership with outside organizations because they ultimately invoke political objectives executed in partnership with civic, security, humanitarian, and military organizations. at lower tactical echelons efforts require understanding of specific aspects of the local situation to identify and mitigate sources of instability. the sbct infantry rifle company uses the acronym sweat-mso (sewage, water, electricity, academics, trash, medical, security, and other considerations), and pmesii-pt (political, military, economic, social, infrastructure, information, physical environment, and time) to address the need to bring about stability in their area of operation. (refer to atp 3-07.5 for more information on stability techniques.) stability 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 4-3 4-12. the sbct infantry rifle company makes the greatest contribution in establish civil security and establish civil control during the initial response and transformation phases of stability operations. restore essential services, support to governance, support to economic infrastructure and development are tasks that the company must utilize partnership with unified action partners to improve. unity of command and an understanding with all unified action partners to include civil affairs units, hnsf, hn government forces, international aid organizations, and so forth for a single focused direction of progress in these efforts is ideal. establish civil s ecurity 4-13. establishing civil security involves providing for the safety of the hn and its population, to include security from internal and external threats; it is essential to providing a safe and secure environment. civil security includes a diverse set of activities. these range from enforcing peace agreements to conducting disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, and includes biometric identity data collection to identify criminal elements, known and suspected terrorists ( kst s), and other irregular forces. 4-14. until a legitimate civil government can assume responsibility for the security, military forces perform the tasks associated with civil security. at the same time, they help develop hn security and police forces. normally, the responsibility for establishing and maintaining civil security belongs to military forces from the onset of operations through transition, when hn security and police forces assume this role. establish civil c ontrol 4-15. establishing civil control is an initial step toward instituting stable, effective governance. although establishing civil security may be the primary responsibility of military forces in a stability mission, this can only be accomplished by restoring civil control. internal threats may manifest themselves as an insurgency, subversive elements within the population, organized crime, or general lawlessness. 4-16. civil control regulates selected behavior and activities of individuals and groups. this control reduces risk to individuals or groups and promotes security. curfews and traffic checkpoints, together with biometric identity data collection, are examples of civil control. restore essential services 4-17. the sbct infantry rifle company is capable of providing only minimal essential services. normally, the military force supports other government, intergovernmental, and hn agencies improving essential services. however, a plan for providing emergency services include: emergency medical care and rescue. the sbct rifle company can participate in civic action program (medcap) and other medical type events. however, most of the time this will need to be run by a higher echelon. medcap can be very beneficial in gaining the trust of the local population. providing food and water. the sbct generally needs to be augmented to provide food and water to the local population. however, a plan for providing food and water should be made in case the need arises. providing emergency shelter. the sbct generally needs to be augmented to provide emergency shelter to the local population. however, a plan for providing emergency shelter should be made in case the need arises. this plan should be developed with higher echelons and with hnsf. support to governance 4-18. stability tasks establish conditions that enable interagency and hn actions to succeed. the military force focuses on transferring control to a legitimate civil authority according to the desired end state. the sbct infantry rifle company, as part of larger unit, can provide support to governance that could include the following: support development of local governance. support anticorruption initiatives. regulate traffic, collect biometric identify data, and searches. security for indigenous authorities. chapter 4 4-4 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016properly detaining suspected criminals and properly holding criminal evidence for the hn’s civil administration of justice. training hnsf and police. security at election sites and ballot transfers. support to economic and infrastructure development 4-19. support to economic and infrastructure development helps a hn develop capability and capacity in these areas. it may involve direct and indirect military assistance to local, regional, and national entities. section ii – planning considerations 4-20. an sbct infantry rifle company is not independently capable of achieving the desired end state of stability tasks. the sbct infantry rifle company achieves success in stability through partnership at the local level by identifying and mitigating sources of instability through partnership and coordinated support from its higher headquarters in collaboration with their unified action partners. the sbct infantry rifle company performs company level missions, tasks, and activities that support the its higher headquarters efforts to maintain or reestablish a safe and secure environment, provide essential governmental services, emergency infrastructure reconstruction and humanitarian relief, and foster economic development. 4-21. as combat operations clear and secure areas of hostile forces, part of the force secures critical infrastructure and populated areas. establishing civil security and civil control and the provision of essential services are implied tasks for commanders during any mission. commanders are legally obligated to minimize civilian suffering. 4-22. commanders plan to minimize the effects of combat on the populace. properly focused, effectively executed stability tasks prevent population centers from degenerating into civil unrest and becoming recruiting areas for opposition movements or insurgencies. 4-23. the commander plans for stability tasks in a manner similar to the offense and defense. the planning process is continuous, constantly adapting as the conditions of the oe are shaped by activities, both natural and human. the resultant plan fosters flexibility, initiative, and adaptability in the face of unforeseen events. the following warfighting functions discuss planning considerations and activities critical for mission success. mission command 4-24. stability tasks, present a unique challenge. combat tasks typically focus on the defeat of an enemy force, stability task focus on the people. in setting the tone for planning, the commander provides the following: his understanding of the people, the area, and his forces. his intent and planning guidance. his concept of operations. 4-25. the commander’s understanding of the oe ultimately determines the appropriate combination of stability and defeat mechanisms necessary to achieve the desired end state. the stability and defeat mechanisms are not limited to combat tasks but can rely on the perceptions that security forces make on the local population. at times, military forces intervene in an unstable situation where the security environment is actively violent in nature. in these cases, military forces may initially use defeat mechanisms to alter the conditions sufficiently to protect the civil populace. in a relatively benign environment where military forces primarily assist or facilitate civil efforts, the stability mechanisms will dominate. 4-26. challenges for the stryker infantry rifle company are the mix of partnered, joint, and combined tasks during operations focused on stability. mission command requires the ability to clearly communicate intent with security forces, hn government, and other nongovernment organizations (ngos) for focused efforts and direction. stability 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 4-5 the importance of understanding culture 4-27. soldiers derive their effectiveness from their ability to understand and work with foreign counterparts from another culture. they need to understand enough of their own culture and their counterpart’s culture to accurately convey ideas, concepts, and purpose without causing counterproductive consequences. soldiers need to be aware of aspects of the local culture and history that influence behavior in their operational environment. soldiers need to understand the reasons and motivations underlying personal interaction and practice patience when working with their counterparts. group norms guide individual behavior, and soldiers need to understand how individuals in a society tend to interact as members of a group, whether a race, ethnic, or kinship group. cultural understanding is not derived from demographic information provided to the military through country briefs prior to deployment. it is gained from studying, interacting, and understanding the people, religion, history, customs, and social and political structures within an area. for true understanding, it is necessary to live among the people, gradually understanding the subtleties and nuances of their culture. leaders in the sbct infantry rifle company ensures that soldiers understand that the actions of one can have a positive or negative effect in the way that the entire unit is viewed by the local population. (refer to atp 3-07.10 for more information.) movement and maneuver 4-28. maneuver in stability environments continue to emphasize security over wide areas and in combined, joint, and partnered maneuver. engagement skills (negotiation, rapport building, cultural awareness, and critical language phrases) are tools that leaders use during movement and maneuver to engage the local population. the intent is to create a stable environment that allows peace to take hold while ensuring the force is protected. movement in operations focused on stability tasks is very deliberate. time is the limiting factor due to the slow pace that security forces take; not just for their protection but also to be seen by the local population and influence their perception. security patrols often take longer during stability tasks to allow the security force to vary their patterns, arrive at destinations in a timely manner to account for contingencies, and have leaders engage the local population. 4-29. the stryker infantry rifle company cannot provide security at all times and all places during wide area security tasks. constant observation will be conducted by the local population and threat forces. a blend of covert and overt operations should be conducted to effectively provide wide areas security. intelligence 4-30. intelligence plays an important role in the sbct infantry rifle c ompany’s accomplishment of a task. the commander uses every element available to collect information that helps him accomplish his mission. every member of the company plays a role in gathering information to support the sbct infantry rifle company. details of information from patrols should be collected from every member that participated. the information collected needs to be cross referenced, analyzed, and shared. the coist manages the information collection effort to ensure every member of the company understands the information required and plays an active role in the collection of that information. this information is shared and analyzed by the s-2 to form intelligence. (refer to chapter 1 for more information on the coist). 4-31. interaction amongst the civilian population provides the greatest amount of information during stability tasks. soldiers should interact with the civilian population according to the commanders pir, and themes and messages to collect information. fires 4-32. although fire support planning for operations focused on stability is the same as for the offense and the defense the use of fire support may be restricted and limited. the commander integrates fire support into his tactical plan. special considerations include the following: procedures for the rapid clearance of fires. close communication and coordination with hn officials. increased security for indirect firing positions. restricted use of certain munitions such as dual-purpose improved conventional munitions (dpicm), area denial artillery munition (adam), or remote antiarmor mine (raam). chapter 4 4-6 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016presence of noncombatants. protected s tructures. 4-33. the need for precision fires is greater in stability tasks. the need to destroy only the designated target with minimal collateral damage often makes our a rmy’s technological and heavy weapons a disadvantage. the use of advanced precision fires from mortars, snipers, rws, and mgs assists in mitigation of the physical collateral damage and communicating to the local population that every measure was taken to engage only the threat to preserve their safety. sustainment 4-34. the oe the sbct infantry rifle company operates in during stability tasks may be austere, creating special sustainment considerations. these factors include, but are not limited to, the following: reliance on local procurement of certain items. aerial resupply of certain classes and may include airlifted rotary-wing cargo sling loads and fixed-wing air drops. ensure health service support and class viii supply and resupply operations meet unit operational support demands. shortages of various critical items, to include repair parts, class iv supply materials, and lubricants. special class v supply requirements (such as nonlethal munitions). reliance on bottled water. class iv supplies for construction of fixed ops and checkpoints. use of facilities or new construction for quarters; water, sewer, and power utilities; and reinforced hardstand areas for maintenance. barriers or berms to protect ammunition and fuel. biometric identity data vetting of locally employed personnel (leps) and other hn support. 4-35. an fsc in the sbct bsb is task-organized to the infantry battalion to provide support. the company xo should be in direct contact with elements of the fsc and bsb, and the infantry battalion s-4 to coordinate logistics. the 1sg oversees the arrival, security, and distribution to the stryker infantry rifle company. the company supply sergeant consolidates, orders, and accounts for all supply requests. these requests should come from the platoon sergeants and section ncoics and reviewed by the commander to ensure that they are able to continue operations. protection 4-36. protection of the force during stability tasks is essential for success at all levels. frequent interaction between u.s. forces and the local population make protection planning difficult and essential. adversaries often blend in with the local populace in stability environments and are difficult to identify, making heightened levels of awareness the norm. sbct leaders should understand that they will be in close proximity of the local population and potential threat but will have difficulty distinguishing between them. techniques for protection during operations focused on stability tasks vary in their application but can include attempts to identify threats through heightened awareness, cultural understanding, local engagements to gain information, personal security for leaders, searches of locals, and biometric identity data collection. 4-37. the close proximity of civilians and soldiers can also promote health issues (such as communicable disease) through close contact with local civilians, detainees, or local foods. force health protection considerations positively support and promote the health of soldiers in the oe. the protection of civil institutions, processes, and systems needed to reach the end state conditions can often be the most decisive factor in stability tasks because its accomplishment is essential for long-term success. civilian areas typically contain structured and prepared routes, roadways, and avenues that can canalize traffic. this can lead to predictable friendly movement patterns that can easily be templated by the enemy. an additional planning consideration during stability tasks is to protect the force while using the minimum force stability 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 4-7 consistent with the approved roe. additional protection considerations during stability tasks include the following: reducing the unexploded explosive ordnance (uxo) and mine threat in the ao. fratricide and friendly fire prevention and minimizing escalation of force incidents through combat, civilian, and multinational identification measures. developing rapid and efficient personnel recovery techniques and drills. clear opsec procedures that account for the close proximity of civilians, ngos, and contractors. disciplined information management techniques to preserve access to computer networks. containment of toxic chemicals and materials present in the civilian environment. survivability requirements for static facilities, positions, or outposts. 4-38. commanders implement appropriate security measures to protect the force. establishment of checkpoints, effective base camp security procedures, and aggressive patrolling are examples of protecting the force. protecting the force requires special consideration in stability environments. this is because threats may be different and, in some cases, opposing forces seek to kill or wound u.s. forces and allies, or destroy or damage property. 4-39. commanders always consider the aspects of security and how they relate to the roe. some examples of protective measures are as follows: secure the inside perimeter following the hn to secure the outside perimeter. avoid predictability by changing routines. include security in each plan, sop, opord, and movement order. develop specific security programs such as threat awareness and opsec. restrict access of unassigned personnel (verified through biometric identify data) to the unit ’s location. constantly maintain an image of professionalism and readiness. base the degree of security established on a continuous threat assessment. section iii – additional tasks 4-40. during operations focused on stability tasks, military forces provide support to facilitate the execution of tasks for which the hn is normally responsible. typically, these tasks have a security component ideally performed by military forces. however, military forces sometimes provide logistic, medical, or administrative support to enable the success of civilian agencies and organizations. tasks that the sbct infantry rifle company performs in stability tasks generally falls into one of three categories. the following represents the collective effort associated with a stability mission: tasks for which military forces retain primary responsibility. tasks for which civilian agencies or organizations likely retain responsibility, but military forces are prepared to execute. tasks for which civilian agencies or organizations retain primary responsibility. area security 4-41. area security preserves the commander ’s ability to help establish political, legal, social, and economic institutions while supporting the transition to legitimate hn governance. when conducting an area security mission, the sbct infantry rifle company prevents threat elements from causing instability in otherwise safe and secure environments. 4-42. the commander may direct his subordinate platoons to employ a variety of techniques such as ops, tcps, sniper team employment, bps, ambushes, mounted and dismounted (or a combination of both) patrols, searches and combat outposts to accomplish this security mission. a reserve or quick reaction force (qrf) enables the commander to react to unforeseen contingencies. using the assigned uas and the information collection capability available to the sbct infantry battalion, the sbct infantry rifle chapter 4 4-8 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016company can execute missions proactively with greater precision. (see chapter 5 for more information on area security.) security force assistance 4-43. security force assistance (sfa) is the unified action to generate, employ, and sustain local, hn, or regional security forces in support of a legitimate authority. it is integral to successful operations focused on stability and extends to all security forces. forces are developed to operate across the range of military operations —combating internal threats such as insurgency, subversion, and lawlessness; defending against external threats; or serving as multinational partners in other areas. sfa at the sbct infantry rifle company may conduct the following: advice, teach/coach, mentor, and augment. (refer to fm 3-22 for more information.) advise 4-44. advisors sent to elements below battalion level help foreign counterparts analyze the mission and commander’s intent from higher headquarters. they assist foreign security force (fsf) leaders restate the mission, conduct an initial risk assessment, identify a tentative decisive point, and define their own intent. they assist their foreign counterparts to analyze the mission variables. from these variables, advisors help their foreign counterparts to develop a coa that meets the higher headquarters concept of operations and commander’s intent. fi nally, they advise and assist in the conduct of operations and the flow of information to the fsf higher commander. teach /coach 4-45. teaching and coaching includes training and education. methods of teaching may include classroom lectures, seminars, hands-on training, training exercises, and simulations. the commander of the advising unit begins with a training assessment of training plans designed during predeployment and passed on from the preceding u.s. units conducted in coordination with the fsf commander. this assessment is important to evaluate the fsf and establish and enhance the working relationship between u.s. and fsf. the training assessment should cover all aspects of leadership, training, and sustainment. 4-46. coaching relies on guiding to bring out and enhance capabilities already present. coaching refers to the function of helping someone through a set of tasks. the coach helps them understand their established level of performance and instructs them how to reach the next level of knowledge and skill. coaching requires identifying short- and long-term goals and devising a plan to achieve those goals. the coach and the person being coached discuss strengths, weaknesses, and a coa to sustain strengths or improve their weaknesses. mentor 4-47. mentorship is a combination of teach, coach and advise. the sbct infantry rifle company demonstrates, at all times, what they have taught, coached, and advised to the fsf. mentors should be aware of the foreign unit’s experience and capabilities and carefully choose opportu nities to inject or impart knowledge. foreign units are most receptive to mentors that teach unobtrusively. augment 4-48. augmenting is an arrangement where fsfs and u.s. units exchange or combine with one another. augmentation improves the interdependence and interoperability of u.s. and foreign security forces. augmentation can occur at many levels and in many different forms. for example, a u.s. squad can be augmented with hn individuals, a u.s. company can be augmented with a hn platoon, or a fsf battalion can be augmented with a company from a u.s. unit. similarly, augmentation can be of short duration for a specific mission or of a longer duration for an enduring operation. section iv – transitions 4-49. transitions mark a change between phases or between the ongoing set of tasks and execution of a branch or sequel. shifting priorities between the elements of decisive action —such as from the offense to operations focused on stability tasks —involves a transition. transitions require planning and preparation stability 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 4-9 well before their execution to maintain the momentum and tempo. the force can be vulnerable during transitions, and commanders establish clear conditions for their execution. transitions may create unexpected opportunities. they may make forces vulnerable to enemy threats. transition to the offense 4-50. during an operation focused on stability tasks there may be instances where units quickly transition back to operations focused on offensive tasks against irregular forces or defensive tasks to defeat counterattacks. to facilitate the transition, commanders consider an offensive contingency while conducting operation focused on stability tasks. they consider how to generate combat power quickly to take the initiative. it can come from organic, partnered, joint and hn forces depending on the situation. transition to the defense 4-51. commanders ensure that transitions from defensive tasks to stability tasks and vice versa are planned. for example, it may be tactically wise for commanders to plan a defensive contingency if there is a significant global, national, or regional event that negatively affects the ao. transitioning to a defense should not negate the progress made during stability tasks. it should be a temporary change made until the initiative can be regained or until the host nation can assume responsibility. 4-52. the conditions for transitioning from stability to a retrograde normally occur during transformation or fostering stability phases. this is most likely when an intended political outcome is aimed at the influen ce of the military’s and security forces presence. the sbct infantry rifle company will most likely support a withdrawal or a retirement as part of a larger force. most likely it will provide security as personnel, equipment, and property and moved out of the host nation. property accountability will require the coordination and clarification for items on various property books and supply chain issues. transfer of authority 4-53. stability tasks include transitions of authority and control between military forces, civilian agencies and organizations, and the hn. each transition involves inherent risk. transitions are identified as decisive points on lines of effort. they typically mark a significant shift in effort and signify the gradual return to civilian oversight and control of the hn. 4-54. often during stability missions’ relief in place (rip) or transfer of authority (toa) occurs. besides the normal responsibilities of a relief, commanders deal with civilians or multinational partners. during stability tasks, units generally know whether they will be relieved at the end of their tour. planning for the toa begins as soon as the unit occupies the ao. 4-55. before the toa, the departing unit develops a continuity book with the necessary intelligence on the ao. the book should include lessons learned, details about the populace, village, and patrol reports, updated maps, and photographs; anything that helps newcomers master the sbct infantry rifle company oe. sbct infantry units should be familiar with their incoming counterparts particularly if it is a different organization that could include mechanized or light infantry or other foreign or north atlantic treaty organization (nato) units. clear articulation of unit organization skills and oe will help the incoming unit identify needs and gaps distinguishing between the different units. commanders should ensure that these continuity books are updated during the unit’s tour of duty. this extensive effort reduces casualties and increase the established and succeeding units’ eff iciency and knowledge of operations. 4-56. a consistent theme from recent operations is the importance of the transition training (right seat/left seat rides) with incoming soldiers during toa. a detailed and programmed toa allows soldiers to learn the culture and effectively work with hn personnel during the deployment. typical training during the relief includes the following: use of ao unique equipment not available before toa. enemy ttps for ieds. personal meetings with ngos, contractors, interpreters, informants, and local police that operate in the unit ao. negotiation techniques with local tribal, religious, and government officials. operations and intelligence handover of databases, plans, products, and briefings. chapter 4 4-10 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016information collection procedures, processes, and policies. transition to civilian/host nation security force control 4-57. during long-term sfa, conditions on the ground, not time, determine the transfer of authority from u.s. forces control or partnership, to host-nation control. the overall authority for the handoff and the subsequent transfer of authority lies with the commander ordering the change. the authority for determining the handoff process lies with the incoming commander assuming responsibility for the mission. this changeover process may affect conditions under which the mission will continue. (refer to fm 3-07, atp 3-07.10, and fm 3-22 for more information.) 4-58. changes in the oe such increased attacks, significant destabilization with the infrastructure or people, culturally impacting events inside or outside the oe or development of security forces may require reshaping force packages as situations change. internal administrative concerns might prompt or support the commander’s decision to rotate units. mission handoff is necessary and define d as the process of passing an ongoing mission from one unit to another with no discernible loss of continuity. 4-59. commanders make specific considerations along with mett-tc when making a handoff to a multinational force. for units relieved of a function by a government agency, procedures typically entail longer handoff times and more complex coordination. outgoing units that have past, present, or future projects planned with agencies prepare to transfer these projects to responsible agents in the incoming unit. 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 5-1 chapter 5 sustainment sustainment is the provision of the logistics, personnel services, and health service support necessary to maintain operations until successful mission completion (adp 4 -0). in the sbct infantry rifle company, the commander has the ultimate responsibility for sustainment. the xo and the 1sg are the company’s primary sustainment operators; they work closely with the sbct infantry battalion staff to ensure they receive the required support for the compan y’s assigned operations. section i – sustainment functions 5-1. the sustainment warfighting function is the related tasks and systems that provide support and services to ensure freedom of action, extend operational reach, and prolong endurance (adrp 3-0). the sustainment warfighting function includes the following tasks: conduct logistics. provide personnel services. provide health service support. 5-2. the sbct infantry rifle company plans, prepares, and executes its portion of the sbct infantry battalion sustainment plan. concurrent with other operational planning, the company develops its sustainment plan during the mission analysis and refines it in the war-gaming portion of the troop-leading process. rehearsals are normally conducted at both battalion and sbct infantry rifle company levels to ensure the company receives a smooth, continuous flow of materiel and services. 5-3. the sbct infantry rifle company’s basic sustainment responsibilities are to report or request support requirements through the correct battalion channels. the sbct infantry battalion is assigned a forward support company and from the bsb that is task organized to support their anticipated logistical requirements based on mission variables. the xo and 1sg manage sustainment requirement and logistical coordination with guidance and oversight provided by the commander. at the company level the sustainment assets include two family of medium tactical vehicles (fmtvs) with trailers and one attached medical evacuation vehicle (mev) with an ambulance squad from the medical platoon. they require accurate personnel and logistical reports, along with other necessary information and requests to sustain the company. conduct logistics 5-4. logistics is planning and executing the movement and support of forces (adrp 4-0). for the sbct infantry rifle company, logistics may involve aspects of supply, field services, maintenance, transportation, distribution, operational contract support, and general engineering support. supply and field services 5-5. the general classes of resupply operations are routine, emergency, or prestock. the company’s sop specifies cues and procedures for each method resupply, which the battalion may choose to conduct. the sbct infantry rifle company carries 72 hours of supply on hand for offense, defense, and stability tasks. the actual method selected for resupply in the field depends on mett-tc factors and is according to the need to replenish a 72 hours of supplies. this allows the subordinate units to carry enough supply to operate for extended periods of time but not inhibit offense, defense, and stability tasks. chapter 5 5-2 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 5-6. supplies are divided into 10 major categories, which are referred to as classes — class i, food, rations, and water. class ii, clothing. class iii, petroleum, oil, and lubricants. class iv, fortification and barrier materials. class v, ammunition. class vi, personal items. class vii, major end items. class viii, medical supplies. class ix, repair parts. class x, materiel to support nonmilitary program. note . there are a few items that do not fit into any of the 10 supply classes, they are categorized as miscellaneous. maintenance 5-7. the nature of the modern battlefield demands that the maintenance system that is flexible and responsive, and focused on returning systems to operational status quickly and as near as possible to the point of failure or damage. this requirement implies a forward thrust of maintenance into the sbct area. maintenance assets move as far forward as the tactical situation permits to return inoperable and damaged equipment to the battle as quickly as possible. 5-8. the fsc assigned to the sbct infantry battalion has a combat field maintenance section and a maintenance control section. the field maintenance sections perform repairs as far forward as possible, returning equipment to the battle quickly. during combat, they perform battle damage assessment and repair (bdar), diagnostics, and on-system replacement of line replaceable units. if the tactical situation permits, they focus on completing jobs on site. field maintenance sections carry limited on board combat spares to facilitate repairs forward. examples include repair and component replacement on tactical wheeled vehicles, power generation equipment, and weapon systems. 5-9. sbct field maintenance is performed by the field maintenance company and the fscs. the field maintenance company in the bsb provides field maintenance support for the sbct units not supported by an fsc and supports fscs for low density equipment items such as armament, electronics, allied trades, and ground support equipment. the field maintenance company provides lift capabilities for the repair shops, recovery of organic equipment, and recovery to supported units, and support of maintenance evacuation. the fscs provide similar field maintenance support to the infantry battalion. field and sustainment maintenance 5-10. field maintenance is generally characterized by on (or near) system maintenance, often using line replaceable unit and component replacement, battle damage assessment, repair and recovery. field level maintenance is not limited to remove and replace, but also provides adjustment, alignment, service and fault/failure diagnoses. field maintenance is performed at all levels of the army and most units have at least some organic field level maintenance capability. sustainment maintenance is characterized by “off system” component repair or “repair and return to supply system” and can be employed at any point in the integrated logistics chain. field maintenance is always repair and return to the user and includes maintenance actions performed by operators. 5-11. sustainment maintenance is off-system component repair and end item repair and return or both to the supply system or by exception to the owning unit, performed by national level maintenance providers. the intent of sustainment maintenance is to perform off-system repairs on all supported items to a standard that provides a consistent and measurable level of reliability. sustainment 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 5-3 transportation and distribution 5-12. the bsb distribution company and fscs have transportation capability and are used to distribute supplies within the sbct. the transportation platoon provides within the distribution company transports supplies to the fscs. the transportation platoon headquarters provides leadership, supervision and technical guidance to tactical truck squads performing motor transport operations to sbct units. the transportation platoon executes missions when ordered by the company or bsb. the fsc distribution section has transportation assets to distribute supplies to the supported sbct infantry battalion. (refer to atp 4-11 for more information.) operational contract support 5-13. contractors and department of the army civilians are playing an ever-increasing role in providing sustainment to military forces. the battalion may use contractors to bridge gaps between required capabilities and actual force structure available within an ao. contractors may be employed, subject to mett-tc, throughout the ao and in virtually all conditions. protecting contractors on the battlefield is the battalion commander’s responsibility. when contractors are expected to perform in potentially hostile areas, the supported military forces assure the protection of their operations and personnel which can include coordination with contracted security firms and other military or paramilitary forces. general engineering support 5-14. general engineering provides support that enables logistics. engineers units from outside the sbct combine and apply capabilities from three engineer disciplines (combat, general, and geospatial engineering) to establish and maintain the infrastructure necessary for sustaining military operations. this involves general engineering tasks that consist of building, repairing, and maintaining roads, bridges, airfields, port facilities, and other structures as well as reinforcing force protection measures. other tasks also include the planning, acquisition, management, remediation and disposition of real estate, supplying mobile electric power, utilities and waste management, environmental support, diving and firefighting (see atp 3-34.40). provide personnel services 5-15. personnel services are sustainment functions that man and fund the force. it also maintains soldier readiness, promotes moral and ethical values, and enables the fighting qualities of the army (adrp 4-0). it includes essential personnel services such as evaluations, leaves and passes, awards and decorations, rest and recuperation, postal, personnel accountability, casualty operations, and personnel management. personnel services include the following functions and are provided by the battalion’s personnel staff officer (s-1) , the sbct’s brigade legal section, and the unit ministry team. human resources. (refer to fm 1-0.) financial management. (refer to fm 1-06.) legal support. (refer to fm 1-04.) religious support. (refer to fm 1-05.) human resources support 5-16. human resources support all functions that affect the soldier’s status, readiness, and welfare. it includes essential personnel services such as evaluations, leaves and passes, awards and decorations, rest and recuperation, postal, personnel accountability, casualty operations, and personnel information management. postal services 5-17. the battalion mail clerk receives and distributes soldier mail to the company mail clerk, usually the supply sergeant, who delivers it to the 1sg, psg, or to the soldier. all outgoing and returned mail is given to the supply sergeant or 1sg during resupply, and is turned over to the s-1 section when the logpac returns to the field trains. chapter 5 5-4 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016personnel management /strength reporting 5-18. personnel accounting is the process of recording by-name data on soldiers when they arrive, depart, change duty location, or change duty status. strength reporting is the numerical end product of the by-name accounting process. 1sgs are critical participants in this process. they need to be sensitive to the accuracy and timeliness of all personnel accounting reports. they should pay special attention to soldiers who have changed status in the medical treatment process and task organization changes when they submit their reports. casualty operations 5-19. casualty operations include production, dissemination, coordination, validation, and synchronization of information regarding each casualty. this information includes casualty reporting, casualty notification, casualty assistance, line-of-duty determination, disposition of remains, and disposition of personal effects, military burial honors, and casualty mail coordination. unit reporting 5-20. as casualties occur, the nearest observer informs the company 1sg via the most expedient method available (for example free text within fbcb2, fm voice). the 1sg submits a personnel status report (perstat) to the sbct infantry battalion s-1 section. this report documents duty status changes on all casualties. casualties are taken to the ccp for classification of injury type (routine, urgent, return to duty), evacuation, and integration into the medical treatment system. the 1sg ensures completed da form 1156 (casualty feeder card ) is forwarded to the sbct infantry battalion s-1, who then enters the data into the defense casualty information processing system (dcips). 5-21. commanders and their 1sgs need to establish procedures to ensure that the soldier’s next of kin are notified properly and according to procedure. the potential for unofficial communications that exist with killed in action (kia) operations also exist in casualty operations. that is, the use of cell phones and computers near the ao enables many soldiers to contact his home station regarding the casualty —such communication is unofficial and unacceptable. the next of kin for soldiers wounded or kia should not receive notification through unofficial means. there is usually a communication blackout until the next of kin is notified. no internet or phone calls home are permitted. medical/personnel accounting 5-22. when a soldier becomes a casualty, the platoon combat medic or emergency care sergeant records the medical treatment the soldier receives on the soldier’s dd form 1380 (tactical combat casualty care (tccc) card ). the bas and brigade support medical company (bsmc) read the soldier’s dd form 1380 when they treat the soldier. the sbct infantry battalion s-1 should electronically receive a notification message to update the soldier’s patient track ing status. in turn, this message should be forwarded to the company. this way, a casualty’s location can be determined and soldiers properly accounted for by the company. 5-23. sustainment planning is fully integrated into all operational planning, with the concept of sustainment support synchronized with the concept of operations. planning is continuous and ongoing. key sustainment planners are the xo, the 1sg, and the supply nco who actively need to participate in the planning process. the company sop should be the basis for sustainment operations, with planning conducted to determine specific requirements and to prepare for contingencies. company orders should address specific operation support matters. deviations from the sustainment sop should be covered early in the planning process. in some situations, sustainment planning begins before receipt of the mission, as part of the ongoing process of refining the sustainment estimate. sustainment planners need to understand the mission statement, commander’s inten t, and concept of operations to provide effective support. development of the company sustainment plan 5-24. the sbct infantry rifle company commander develops his sustainment plan by first determining exactly what supplies he has on hand and then estimating his support requirements. if equipped with fbcb2, the commander can review his commander’s track item list (ctil) and verify his supply status. he uses available information from his mission analysis and from war-gaming to aid his sustainment plan sustainment 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 5-5 development. this process is important not only in confirming the validity of the sustainment plan but also in ensuring that the company’s support requests are submitted early. 5-25. the commander can formulate his sustainment execution plan and submit support requests based on the results of his tlp. the sustainment plan should answer a variety of operational questions, such as — based on the nature of the operation and specific tactical factors, what types of support will the sbct infantry rifle company need? in which quantities will this support be required? the discussion should answer the following questions: will emergency resupply be required during the operation? does this operation require prestock supplies? what are the composition, disposition, and capabilities of the expected enemy threat and how will this affect sustainment during the operation? the discussion should answer the following questions: where and when will the expected contact occur? based on the nature and location of expected contact, what are the sbct infantry rifle company’s expected casualties and vehicle losses? what impact will the enemy’s special weapons capabilities (such as cbrn) have on the operation and on expected sustainment requirements? how many epws/detainees are expected and where? how will terrain and weather affect sustainment operations during the operation? the discussion should answer the following questions: what ground will provide optimum security for the trains? what ground will provide optimum security for maintenance and ccps? what are the sbct infantry rifle company’s medevac lzs and casevac routes? what are the company’s “dirty” routes for evacuation of contaminated personnel, vehicles, and equipment? when and where will the sbct infantry rifle company need sustainment? the discussion should answer the following questions: based on the nature and location of expected contact, which sites are the best for the maintenance collection points? based on the nature and location of expected contact, which sites are the best for the ccps? where will the epws/detainees collection points be located? which logistics release point (lrps) will be active during the operation? when will they be active? what are the criteria and triggers for the movement of the company combat trains? what are the support priorities (by element and type of support)? the discussion should answer the following questions: does each platoon have a pathfinder qualified person to establish a hasty lz for medevac? where can i place the mev to casevac the most casualties with minimal impact on combat power? which platoon has priority for emergency class iii resupply? which platoon has priority for emergency class v resupply? should the fmtv be loaded with the emergency supplies or should it be empty in case of mass casualty (mascal) or epw transportation? will there be lulls in the operation that will permit support elements to conduct resupply operations in relative safety? if no lulls are expected, how can the sbct infantry rifle company best minimize the danger to the sustainment vehicles? based on information developed during the sustainment planning process, which resupply technique should be used? chapter 5 5-6 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 section ii – sustainment responsibilities and supporting units 5-26. the discussion below is an expansion of the duties, responsibilities, and units described in chapter 1. executive officer 5-27. the xo is the sbct infantry rifle company’s primary sustainment planner and coordinator, reporting directly to the commander. during preparations for the operation, he works closely with the 1 sg to determine specific support requirements of the tactical plan. he then ensures that proper arrangements are made to provide those support requirements. the xo also performs these logistical functions:  determines the location of the company’s resupply point based on data developed during operational planning.  compiles da form 5988-e/da form 2404 ( equipment inspection and maintenance worksheet , available through the property book unit supply enhanced (pbuse) system) from the platoon leaders, platoon sergeants (psgs), and the 1sg and provides updates to the commander, as required.  along with the 1sg, ensures that the sbct infantry rifle company executes sustainment operations according to the sbct infantry battalion plan.  leads the sbct infantry rifle company sustainment rehearsal in cooperation with the company 1sg.  assists the commander in developing sustainment priorities and guidance according to the sbct infantry battalion concept of support and enforces those priorities.  conducts close coordination with the battalion operation staff officer (s-3) and logistics staff officer (s-4) for planning and resourcing company missions.  manages all of the company commander’s property books. first sergeant 5-28. the 1sg is the senior nco and the most experienced soldier in the company. he is the commander ’s primary tactical advisor and the expert on individual and nco skills. he assists the commander in planning, coordinating, and supervising all activities that support the unit mission. he operates where the commander directs or where his duties require him. his specific duties include the following: executes and supervises routine operations. this includes enforcing the tacsop, planning and coordinating training, coordinating and reporting personnel and administrative actions, and supervising supply, maintenance, communications, field hygiene, and medevac operations. supervises, inspects, or observes matters designated by the commander. (for example, he observes and reports on a portion of the company ’s ao or zone, inspects the mortar section, or inspects all range cards.) directs and supervises casevac, ensuring medical assets remain flexible and responsive to tactical operations. assists and coordinates with the xo and is prepared to assume the xo’s duties. leads task-or ganized elements or subunits on designated missions. provides an sbct infantry rifle company orientation for new personnel and, in consultation with the commander, assigns replacements to the company’s subordinate elements. supervises evacuation of casualties, epws, detainees, and damaged equipment. directs and supervises the collection, initial identification, and evacuation of human remains to the mortuary affairs collection point (macp). maintains the sbct infantry rifle company battle roster. sustainment 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 5-7 supply sergeant 5-29. the supply sergeant, or his supply clerk, is the sbct infantry rifle company’s representative to the sbct infantry battalion s-4. the supply sergeant performs the following logistical functions: controls the supply trucks that are organic to the company. monitors the tactical situation and anticipates logistical requirements. uses the battalion a/l radio network or their fbcb2 net to communicate with the company. coordinates with the bsb for resupply of class i, iii, and v. maintains individual supply and clothing records, and requisitions class ii resupply. requisitions class iv and class vii equipment and supplies. picks up replacement personnel and delivers them to the 1sg. receives and evacuates human remains to the macp in the brigade support area (bsa). transports, guards, or transfers epws and detainees. guides the logpac, along with epws, detainees, and damaged vehicles (if applicable), back to the bsa. coordinates with the sbct infantry battalion s-1 section to turn in or pick up mail and personnel action documents. collects bagged contaminated soil and transports it to collection points as part of logpac procedures. maintains and provides supplies for company field sanitation activities. manages commander’s property book and prepares financial liability investigations of property loss. company combat medics 5-30. combat medics are assigned to the medical platoon tasked to support the sbct infantry battalion. combat medics are allocated to the sbct infantry rifle companies on the basis of one combat medic to a platoon, and one emergency care sergeant to a company. the location of the combat medic is of extreme importance for rapid medical treatment of casualties. 5-31. the sbct infantry rifle platoon combat medic usually locates with, or near, the platoon sergeant . the platoon sergeant determines which element the medic goes with in support of the platoon leaders maneuver plan. he has the option to send him with the infantry when they dismount the icv or remain in the icv to respond to a casualty. when the platoon is mounted, the combat medic usually rides in the same vehicle as the psg. 5-32. the company emergency care sergeant collocates with the company trains. when a casualty occurs, the combat life saver (cls) renders first aid, or first aid is provided through self-aid or buddy aid. the platoon combat medic or the company emergency care sergeant then goes to the location of the casualty using tactical combat casualty care procedures in the combat oe. the ccp combat medic makes his assessment; administers initial medical care; initiates a dd form 1380 or da form 1156; and then requests evacuation or returns the individual to duty. (refer to chapter 1, section iii, for additional responsibilities of sbct infantry rifle company combat medics.) forward support compa ny 5-33. the bsb of the sbct has six organic fscs that are task organized to support the maneuver battalions. the role of the fsc is to provide direct logistics support to the sbct infantry battalion. the fsc provides the supported commander with dedicated logistics assets organized specifically to meet the battalion’s requirements. the fsc provides field feeding, bulk fuel, general supply, ammunition, and field maintenance. the fsc commander is the senior logistician for the battalion. the fsc commander assists the battalion s4 with the battalion logistics planning and is responsible for executing the logistics plan following the bsb and supported battalion commanders’ guidance. the fsc receives supplies and maintenance support for low density equipment from the bsb. the fsc is organized to support — food and water (class i). chapter 5 5-8 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016fuel (class iii). ammunition (class v). repair parts (class ix). maintenance and recovery. supply and distribution. 5-34. depending on the current operation and situation an fsc may be attached to or placed under opcon of the infantry battalion. fsc attachment or opcon to the sbct infantry battalion is limited in duration and may be for a specific mission or phase of an operation. the fsc may split its capabilities and place some elements of that company in the bsa if the mission dictates this. the fsc normally colocates its cp with or near the ctcp. the location of the fsc’s platoons and sections is determined by the battalion commander to support maneuver. (see figure 5 -1) legend: fld maint = field maintenance , fsc = forward support company, hq co = headquarters company, rec = recovery, svc = service figure 5-1. forward support company section iii – conduct logistics 5-35. there are few, if any, contingencies in which u.s. military forces have all the supplies they need for an operation. it is essential that every unit’s daily logistical report needs to accurately reflect not only its operational needs but also what supplies and equipment are on hand. 5-36. the general classes of resupply operations are routine, emergency, or prestock. the sbct infantry rifle company sop specifies cues and procedures for each method, which the company rehearses during company training exercises. the actual method selected for resupply in the field depends on mett-tc. plan 5-37. logistics planners adjust standardize sustainment packages, providing all units with sufficient quantities of each supply item in anticipation of their requirements. these adjusted packages are based on what supplies are reported on hand, consumed, and pl anned operations. together with the commander’s guidance for issuance of scarce, but heavily requested supply items, accurate reporting allows planners to sustainment 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 5-9 quickly forecast supply constraints and then to submit requisitions to alleviate projected shortages. inaccurate or incomplete reporting can severely handicap efforts to balance unit requirements and available supplies. as a result, some units may go into combat without enough supplies to accomplish their mission while others may have an excess of certain items. 5-38. the basic load includes supplies that the sbct infantry rifle company keeps on its organic support vehicles for use in combat. the amount of time the sbct infantry rifle company sustains itself in combat without resupply determines its quantity of supply items. 5-39. the higher command or the sop specifies the class v basic load. (see table 5-1, figure 5-2, and figure 5-3 on -11 .) table 5-1: days of supply class i, iii, and iv class (cl) i class iii class iv individual 9 x meals ready to eat (mre) (3 per day) 3 x gallons of w

figure 5-2. basic load for stryker infantry rifle company sustainment 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 5-11 5-40. the sbct infantry rifle company’s combat load includes the supplies that it carries into the fight. the sbct infantry battalion commander dictates minimum requirements; however, the sbct infantry rifle company commander or the unit sop specifies most items. specific combat loads vary by mission (see figure 5-3). legend: ag = assistant gunner, ar = automatic rifleman, at spc = antiarmor specialist, dm = designated marksman, dvr = driver, gren = grenadier, mg = machine gunner, pl = platoon leader, plt fo = platoon forward officer, plt med = platoon medic, psg = platoon sergeant, ratelo = radio telephone operator, sl = squad leader figure 5-3. infantry combat load chapter 5 5-12 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016prepare 5-41. thorough briefings and comprehensive rehearsals are important keys to effective sustainment planning. these activities play a critical role in ensuring that the sbct infantry rifle company can execute its sustainment plans efficiently. they allow the commander, his subordinate leaders, and each soldier to discover potential problem areas and to develop contingency plans to avoid unforeseen difficulties. 5-42. the commander has several options for conducting sustainment rehearsals. one is to integrate the sustainment rehearsal into the unit’s larger maneuver rehearsals. another alternative is for the unit’s sustainment operators to conduct a separate rehearsal. the sbct infantry rifle company commander may direct the xo and 1sg to rehearse sustainment operations with the company’s psgs, the battalion maintenance team, and battalion medical platoon for vehicle recovery, casevac, or mascal. explosive ordnance disposal (eod) personnel are included when necessary by the mission. routine resupply 5-43. routine resupply operations cover items in classes i, iii, v, and ix as well as provide opportunity to transport mail, soldiers, and other items the sbct infantry rifle company requests. when possible, the sbct infantry rifle company should conduct routine resupply daily, ideally during periods of limited visibility. routine resupply breaks should have standard configured packages for 24-, 48-, and 72-hours based on their operations they conduct in the offense, defense, or stability with considerations of the operating environment. common to all packages are class i specifically water and food, and class iii fuel. these are consumed at the highest rates and must be replenished constantly. logistics package operations 5-44. the logpac technique is a simple, efficient way to accomplish routine resupply operations. the key feature is a centrally organized resupply convoy originating at the sbct infantry battalion trains. it carries all items needed to sustain the sbct infantry rifle company for a specific period, usually 24 hours or until the next scheduled logpac. sbct infantry rifle company and battalion sops specify the exact composition and march order of the logpac. 5-45. normally, the first logpac is configured during preparation phase of the battalions operation in bsa. this logpac is loaded and begins movement to the battalion field trains during the execution phase of the operation. sbct infantry rifle company commanders must be aware that the logpac is configured before their operation is completed. to resupply specific items through routine resupply can often take 24 to 36 hours from ordering to receiving, if the bsb has the item on hand. it will require more time if the bsb has to acquire from higher sustainment echelons. 5-46. the sbct infantry rifle company supply sergeant first compiles and coordinates all of the company’s supply requests with the bsb. h e obtains the following: class i, class iii (bulk and packaged products), and class v supplies from the bsb. this usually entails employment of one or two fuel hemtt and one or two cargo hemtts. class ii, class iv (basic load resupply only), class vi, and class vii supplies from sbct infantry battalion s-4. the battalion aid station receives support for class viii from the medical logistics elements located in the medical company, and hhc of the brigade support battalion. the battalion aid station then pushes required class viii to each of the rifle companies during logpac. routine class ix supplies and maintenance documents (as required) from the prescribed load list section in the bsb. replacement personnel and soldiers returning from a medical treatment facility. vehicles returning to the sbct infantry rifle company area from maintenance. mail and personnel action documents (to include awards and finance and legal documents) from the battalion s-1 section. 5-47. when logpac preparations are completed, the supply sergeant initiates tactical movement to the lrp under the supervision of the fsc transportation platoon leader. the supply sergeant and logpac link up with the 1sg at the lrp. sustainment 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 5-13 execute 5-48. below are the techniques the sbct infantry rifle company uses to execute logistics. actions at the logistics release point 5-49. when the 1sg or his representative arrives at the lrp to pick up the sbct infantry rifle company logpac, he updates all personnel and logistical reports. the field trains oic briefs on changes to the tactical or support situation. he then escorts the convoy to the sbct rifle company resupply point, providing security during movement from the lrp. resupply procedures 5-50. the time required for resupply is an important planning factor. units need to conduct resupply quickly and efficiently to ensure operational effectiveness, and to allow the sbct infantry rifle company logpac to return to the lrp on time. 5-51. once the unit completes resupply operations, the unit prepares the logpac vehicles for the return trip. sbct infantry rifle company vehicles requiring recovery for maintenance or salvage are lined up and prepared for towing. cargo trucks, fuel trucks, or damaged vehicles transport those killed in action. epws and detainees ride in the cargo trucks, and are guarded by walking wounded or other company personnel. all supply requests, human resources actions, and outgoing mail are consolidated for forwarding to the field trains, where the appropriate staff section processes them for the next logpac. 5-52. the 1sg or the supply sergeant leads the logpac back to the lrp, where he links up with the bsb transportation platoon leader. when possible, the reunited task force logpac convoy returns to the field trains together. when mett-tc dictates or when the logpac arrives too late to rejoin the larger convoy, the sbct infantry rifle company vehicles need to return to the field trains on their own. because only minimal security assets are available, this situation should be avoided. resupply methods 5-53. as directed by the commander or xo, the 1sg establishes the sbct infantry rifle company’s resupply point using the service station method or the tailgate method. he briefs each logpac driver on which method or methods to use. when the resupply point is ready, the 1sg informs the commander, who in turn directs each platoon or element to conduct resupply based on the tactical situation. service station resupply 5-54. with the service station method, vehicles move individually or in small groups to a centrally located resupply point. depending on the tactical situation, one vehicle or section, or even an entire platoon, moves out of its position, conducts resupply operations, and then moves back into position. this process continues until the entire sbct infantry rifle company has been resupplied. (see figure 5-4.) 5-55. when using this method, vehicles enter the resupply point following a one-way traffic flow; only vehicles requiring immediate maintenance stop at the maintenance holding area. vehicles move through each supply location, with crews rotating individually to eat, pick up mail and sundries, and refill or exchange water cans. when all platoon vehicles and crews have completed resupply, they move to a holding area where, time permitting, the platoon leader and psg conduct a precombat inspection (pci) . the company command group (rifle company commander, xo, and 1sg) can take this opportunity to conduct pcis of each platoon as they pass through the resupply point. chapter 5 5-14 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 legend: ammo = ammunition, epw = enemy prisoner of war, 1sg = first sergeant , mev = medical, evacuation vehicle figure 5-4. service station method tailgate resupply 5-56. tailgate resupply usually requires much more time than do service station operations. usually, units use the tailgate method only when the tactical situation allows or dictates. combat vehicles remain in their vehicle positions or back out a short distance to allow trucks carrying class iii and class v supplies to reach them. individual crewmen rotate through the feeding area, pick up mail and sundries, and fill or exchange water cans. any epws and detainees are centralized and guarded. soldiers kia and their personal effects are brought to the holding area, where the 1sg takes charge of them. (see figure 5-5 on -15 .) sustainment 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 5-15 legend: co = commander, logpac = logistics package, lrp = logistics release point, psg = platoon sergeant, mgs = mobile gun system figure 5-5. tailgate resupply method combination of service station and tailgate resupply 5-57. the sbct infantry rifle company may select to employ the tailgate resupply method, but selected platoons may have to use the service station resupply method. selected platoon(s) may use the service station resupply method and some sections may have to use the tailgate resupply method. emergency resupply 5-58. occasionally (usually during combat operations), the sbct infantry rifle company has such an urgent need for resupply that it cannot wait for a routine logpac. emergency resupply may involve classes iii, v, and viii, and cbrn equipment. on rare occasions, class i emergency resupply can be conducted using either the service station or tailgate method, although procedures may have to be adjusted when the sbct infantry rifle company is in contact with the enemy. in the service station method, individual vehicles pull back during a lull in combat on order of the commander or platoon leader; they conduct resupply and then return to the fight. with tailgate resupply, the sbct infantry rifle company brings limited supplies forward to the closest concealed position behind each vehicle or element. in case of emergency, class viii resupply is conducted in concert with the evacuation of casualties/patients or through the use of push packages. chapter 5 5-16 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016prepositioned supplies 5-59. prepositioning of supplies is most often required in defensive or stability tasks. usually only class v items are prepositioned. class iii supplies can be prepositioned. however, this requires sbct infantry rifle company vehicles to refuel before moving into fighting positions during initial occupation of the battle position. they may move out of their fighting positions to conduct refueling operations at the rear of the bp. 5-60. leaders at every level carefully plan and execute prepositioning supplies. all leaders, down to vehicle commander and squad leader, know the exact locations of prestock sites, which they verify during reconnaissance or rehearsals. the sbct infantry rifle company takes steps to ensure survivability of prestock supplies. these measures include digging in prestock positions and selecting covered and concealed positions. the company commander develops a plan to remove or destroy prepositioned supplies to prevent the enemy from capturing them. (see figure 5-6 and 5-7 on -17 .) 5-61. during offensive tasks, leaders can employ mobile pre-positioning loading supplies on trucks and positioning them forward in the ao. this technique works well if the sbct infantry rifle company expects to use a large volume of ammunition during a fast-moving operation. figure 5-6. prestock resupply operations —method 1 (central class v prestock site) sustainment 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 5-17 figure 5-7. prestock resupply operations —method 2 (class v prestock site for each vehicle) aerial delivery 5-62. aerial delivery can be used as a method of resupply (see chapter 6, section iv this publication for more information). the following should be considered: the use of aerial delivery requires the coordination of the sbct infantry battalion staff and the bct s-3, s-4, and adam/brigade aviation element (bae) sections. special reemphasis is placed on the enemy air defense capability. all companies need to know how to select lz/dz to receive aerial resupply. the delivered supplies are immediately transported away from the lz/dz. units should return the sling or air delivery equipment to its owning unit. chapter 5 5-18 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 section iv – maintenance and vehicle recovery 5-63. the maintenance of weapons, equipment, and the stryker vehicle is continuous. every soldier needs to know how to maintain his weapon, equipment, and perform operator level maintenance on the stryker vehicle according to the related technical manual. the commander, xo, and 1sg need to understand maintenance for every piece of equipment in the company as well as the standard operating procedures of the battalion and sbct. levels of maintenance 5-64. the army employs the field and sustainment levels of maintenance as described below. field maintenance 5-65. field maintenance is on-system maintenance, and mainly involves preventive maintenance and replacement of defective parts. the goal of field maintenance is to repair and return equipment to the soldier. it covers tasks previously assigned to operator/crew, organization/unit, and direct support maintenance levels. it includes some off-system maintenance critical to mission readiness. sustainment maintenance 5-66. the company executive officer oversees sustainment maintenance of company headquarters elements that include communications, cbrn, armorer, vehicle maintenance, and supply. he is responsible to ensure that replacement or defective parts for all equipment are conducted within army standards. the 1sg oversees the soldiers working within the company headquarters to ensure that the soldiers within the company have the proper equipment and supplies to perform their tasks. recovery 5-67. vehicle recovery must be planned as a contingency to an operation. the sbct infantry rifle company commander must remain flexible with his maneuver plan to lessen the impact of an inoperative vehicle during the execution phase. the leaders of the company should rehearse battle drills to speed in the recovery of the vehicle to continue operations. the stryker vehicle has the advantage of self-recovery but occasionally requires a wrecker. 5-68. the techniques with stryker vehicle recovery are to recover the vehicle to the rear or recover the vehicle forward during reorganization and consolidation. the decision is made by the company commander on which technique to employ and based on mett-tc. soldiers with the vehicle requiring recovery will either stay with the vehicle and assists in its repair or cross level equipment and personnel onto other vehicles and continue mission. section v – army health system support 5-69. army health system support is a component of the military health system that is responsible for operational management of the health service support and force health protection missions for training, predeployment, deployment, and postdeployment operations. army health system includes all mission support services performed, provided, or arranged by the army medical department to support health service support and force health protection requirements for the army and as directed, for joint, intergovernmental agencies, coalition, and multinational forces. this system includes both force health protection and health service support. force health protection encompasses measures to promote, improve, conserve, or restore the mental or physical well-being of soldiers. these measures enable a healthy and fit force, prevent injury and illness, and protect the force from health hazards. these measures include the prevention aspects of a number of army medical department functions (preventive medicine, including medical surveillance and occupational health surveillance; veterinary services, including the food inspection and animal care missions, and the prevention of zoonotic disease transmissible to man; combat and operational stress control; dental services [preventive dentistry]; and laboratory services [area medical laboratory support]). sustainment 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 5-19 5-70. health service support completes the army health system. health service support encompasses all support and services performed, provided, or arranged by the army medical department to promote, improve, conserve, or restore the mental and physical well-being of personnel in the army. additionally, as directed, provide support in other services, agencies, and organizations. this includes casualty care (encompassing a number of army medical department functions —organic and area medical support, hospitalization, and treatment aspects of dental care and behavioral/neuropsychiatric treatment, clinical laboratory services, and treatment chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear patients), medical evacuation, and medical logistics. (refer to fm 4-02 for more information.) casualty procedures 5-71. casualties are an unfortunate part of combat. they can occur at any point during an operation and are contingency leaders must prepare for. before moving a casualty it is important to know where the casualty needs to go, this may be determined by the severity of injuries, number of casualties, and availability of the medical treatment facility. casualties vary in level of care and are treated at different facilities with varies levels of capability. they are labeled as roles 1 to 4. army air and ground evacuation platforms provide connectivity to assure a seamless continuum of medical care (refer to atp 4-02.2 for more information). (see figure 5-8.) legend: ao = area of operations, conus = continental united states, poi = point of injury figure 5-8. army air and ground evacuation 5-72. the sbct infantry rifle company is responsible for planning and coordination for the quickest response to a casualty with minimal impact on the mission as possible. this may include coordination with adjacent units and their support. the platoon or element with the casualty is responsible to provide security, respond to the casualty (combat medic preferred), and notify the company of the situation. the combat medic’s assessment of the casualty determines the time requirement and levels of treatment the commander needs to support his decision for possible options. the commander must nest his casevac plan and procedures with his higher echelons as well as know the locations of adjacent units medical faculties in order to meet a timely response for the casualty. the table 5-2 will tell what evacuation procedures are required for casualties. (refer to atp 4-25.13 for more information.) chapter 5 5-20 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016table 5-2. categories of evacuation precedence priority i─urgent is assigned to emergency cases that should be evacuated as soon as possible and within a maximum of 1 hour in order to save life, limb, or eyesight, to prevent complications of serious illness, or to avoid permanent disability. priority ia─urgent -surg is assigned to emergency cases that should be evacuated as soon as possible and within a maximum of 1 hour in order to save life, limb, or eyesight, to prevent complications of serious illness, or to avoid permanent disability. priority ii─priority is assigned to sick and wounded personnel requiring prompt medical care. this precedence is used when the individual should be evacuated within 4 hours or his medical condition could deteriorate to such a degree that he will become an urgent prece dence, or whose requirements for special treatment are not available locally, or who will suffer unnecessary pain or disability. priority iii─routine is assigned to sick and wounded personnel requiring evacuation but whose condition is not expected to det eriorate significantly. the sick and wounded in this category should be evacuated within 24 hours. priority iv─convenience is assigned to patients for whom evacuation by medical platform is a matter of medical convenience rather than necessity. the nato stanag 3204 has deleted the category of priority iv —convenience; however, it will still be included in the u.s. army evacuation priorities as there is a requirement for it on the battlefield. techniques 5-73. techniques for the sbct infantry rifle company to handle casualties are — consolidate casualties at a casualty collection point for the company and move them to a role 1 or higher facility under company headquarters control. have the element with the casualty establish a secure lz and call for medevac. the company sends the mev with security escort and picks up casualties at point of injury and transports them to role 1 or higher facility.  the company mev with security escort conducts a linkup with the element with the casualty. the company authorizes diraluth to the element with the casualty and they transport the casualty to the nearest role 1 or higher medical facility. 5-74. within the sbct infantry rifle company, the following vehicles can be

international law, military training, roe, and ethical principles demand that epws, detainees, and civilians be accorded the utmost humane treatment — sustainment 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 5-21 ensure procedures of 5-s’s and t ( search, silence, segregate, safety, speed, and tag) are followed. use blindfolds for detainees (according to roe) as necessary to prevent intelligence collection. have available sand/dust goggles, duct tape, neck gaiters, and pressure dressings. standardiz e epw kits. gather detainee packets with vehicles or at a collection point. evacuate all detainees to the same location. keep personal effects with the detainee. use ziploc baggies for this purpose. take photos of each detainee and items of intelligence or evidentiary value in possession of the detainee. conduct biometrics identity data collection. use zip ties or flex cuffs to secure detainees. dedicate vehicles for detainee transportation. this requirement should be separate from casevac and hnsf transportation requirements. plan for blankets or clothing to safeguard detainees when operations are conducted at night during inclement weather. recover shoes for the detainee to wear. remember documentation is important. enemy forces may be released because of improper documentation. use explosive detection kits when available. they should be used immediately to provide additional evidence for future legal processing. provide needle proof gloves if possible to avoid injury to those searching and handling detainees. captured enemy equipment and captured enemy ammunition 5-76. consolidate captured enemy equipment (cee) and captured enemy ammunition (cea) at the end of the operation. this action should have senior leadership oversight preferably the company 1sg and xo. normally the 1sg is responsible and oversees the consolidation and the xo is responsible for the coordination for transportation and disposal with supporting elements. units need to develop a plan to consolidate, handle, and move cee and cea. be prepared to secure areas where cee and cea are found. blow it up in place, if needed. all units should have this capability due to lack of availability of eod/engineers. follow restrictions in roe or unit directives. possess the means to carry contraband (garbage bags, sandbags, and so forth) and backhaul it to a captured enemy equipment or ammunition site. handle uxo/ied/booby traps according to unit sop. possess the means to catalog and record cee and cea information, to include photographic media. transportation 5-77. the xo and commander are responsible to plan sufficient transportation to move the unit in a manner that supports the ground tactical plan. a technique is to plan ground movement in a manner similar to an air assault operation with five phases. they are as follows: staging plan. loading plan. movement plan. unloading, control, security, and consolidation of vehicles plan (during execution). withdrawal plan. 5-78. be aware that vehicles may not be organic to a unit, so place someone from that unit to mission command and maintain accountability/liaison with the vehicles. make every effort to integrate attached units, assets, and personnel. usually, the xo coordinates with the attached units and the 1sg manages their and oversees their support efforts. this includes briefings, rehearsals, and inspections of personnel, equipment, and vehicles. ensure understanding of sops and contact drills and conduct detailed rehearsals. hnsf need to be part of the transportation plan. movement may be by their own assets or provided to them. if they are part of the operation then they are included and accounted for in our transportation plan. chapter 5 5-22 atp 3-21.11 4 february 20165-79. a master manifest should be maintained at unit level that includes sensitive item inventories and other important information. this list can be used to establish accountability if vehicles or sensitive items are lost. conduct preventive maintenance (pm) or preventive maintenance checks and services (pmcs) on vehicles before departure. cross-level or load vehicles with key leaders, skills, logistics, medical assets, and weapons systems to avoid the loss of critical assets with the loss of one vehicle. make sure vehicles are marked or possess markers that can be used to identify their locations to deconflict air and other friendly fires. to facilitate mission command, vehicles can be marked on the sides or back based on their departure times or elements during movement. nontraditional assets such as civilian trucks may be appropriated according to established roe to assist in moving personnel or material to or from the objective. 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 6-1 chapter 6 augmenting combat power for the sbct infantry rifle company to achieve its full combat potential, the commander integrates all available assets effectively. this chapter discusses fires, protection, aviation, inform and influence activities (iia), military information support operations, and civil affairs. section i – fires 6-1. fire support is fires that directly support land, maritime, amphibious, and special operations forces to engage enemy forces, combat formations, and facilities in pursuit of tactical and operational objectives (jp 3-09). fire support assets include mortars, field artillery (fa) cannons, rockets, missiles, cas, and naval gunfire (ngf). nonlethal effects may be achieved using obscuration or illumination munitions, and some electronic warfare assets. nonlethal effects may be achieved by using munitions in a manner designed to influence rather than injure an opponent. an example of this use might be firing massed artillery at an uninhabited area in the opponent’s view to influence his actions. fire support team 6-2. chapter 1, sections iii and iv discussed briefly the organization, duties, and responsibilities of the sbct infantry rifle company fist personnel. this section examines in more detail the equipment, capabilities, procedures, and other considerations that affect the sbct infantry rifle company fist and its employment in the accomplishment of lethal and nonlethal fire support tasks. a fire support team is a field artillery team organic to each maneuver battalion and selected units to plan and coordinate all available company supporting fires, including mortars, field artillery, naval surface fire support and close air support integration (fm 3-09). the company commander is ultimately responsible for integrating fires in support of his scheme of maneuver; the company fso serves as his principle advisor for fire support. the company fso fully needs to understand the company commander’s scheme of maneuver. on the basis of the commander’s guidance, the company fso synchronizes fire support within the maneuver plan and presents the fire support plan to the commander for his approval. a forward observer is an observer operating with front line troops trained to adjust ground or naval gunfire and pass back battlefield information (jp 3-09). in the absence of a qualified air controller, the observer may control close air support strikes. platoon forward observers are equipped with target acquisition devices that assist in accurately locating targets and the communications gear needed to call for fire. they are the primary fire support observers in the company/troop and are frequently collocated with platoon leaders. they provide target refinement, execute planned fires, and request fires for their supported platoons. a joint fires observer (jfo) is a trained and certified service member who can request, adjust, and control surface-to -surface fires. for air- to-surface fires, they can provide timely and accurate targeting information to the joint tactical air controller (jtac) or, when approved by the jtac, to the aircraft directly, and perform autonomous terminal guidance operations (tgo). the jfo adds joint warfighting capability but cannot provide terminal attack control during cas operations (atp 3-09.32/mcrp 3-16.6a/nttp 3-09.2/afttp(i) 3-2.6 ). communications 6-3. the fist has the capability to transmit on or monitor these five networks: fires battalion fire direction net (digital). the fist uses this net to send calls for fire. chapter 6 6-2 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016sbct infantry rifle company command network (voice). this network enables the fist to monitor company operations, and links it to the commander and platoon leaders for planning and coordination. blue force tracker (bft)/joint capabilities release (jcr) enables the fist to have a cop with the sbct infantry rifle company, the sbct infantry battalion fires cell, and other fire support teams. sbct infantry battalion fire support network (voice). the fist communicates with the fires on this network for which the fires cell is the ncs. mortar platoon fire direction network (digital). as needed, the fist sends fire missions to the supporting mortar platoon or section using this network. fire support team employment 6-4. the sbct infantry rifle company fire support officer (fso), usually collocated with the company commander, positions the fire support vehicle where he or the senior fire support sergeant can observe and control execution of the fires plan or a specified fire support task most effectively. the fso establishes op that takes maximum advantage of the capability of the lightweight laser designator/rangefinder (lldr) system and laser designator module (ldm) to execute lethal, accurate fires. the fso communicates with the commander on the company command net. this option allows the fso to maintain effective control of his fos and to conduct required fires coordination. fire support planning and coordination 6-5. effective fire support does not happen without prior planning and coordination. the observer knows what his responsibilities are and where he fits into the overall plan. 6-6. the fso is in charge of the company fist. he is also the principal fire support advisor to the company commander when assigned or attached to a company or troop. the fist plans, coordinates, and executes fire support for the company commander’s concept of operations. the fso ensures he thoroughly understands what the company commander is trying to do and how the commander wants fires to influence the operation. 6-7. the maneuver commander has the responsibility to integrate fire support with the scheme of maneuver. he provides the commander’s intent for an operation and issues guidance, including guidance for fire support. the fso translates the guidance into tasks for fire support. the fso then assigns tasks to the observers that enable the fist to complete the tasks assigned by the commander. 6-8. the maneuver commander also has the responsibility to ensure that observers understand what targets can be engaged, when they can be engaged, and which targets are the priority for the operation. 6-9. observers have a responsibility to ensure they understand the criteria for engaging targets established by the commander. (refer to atp 3-09.32/mcrp 3-16.6a/nttp 3-09.2/afttp(i) 3-2.6) for more information on fire support planning and coordination .) 6-10. fire support planning includes developing integrated fire plans (target lists, fire support execution matrix (fsem), fist matrix, scheme of fires, and overlays) and determining forward observer control options that support the commander’s scheme of maneuver. 6-11. the fist stays abreast of the maneuver situation at all times and monitor voice requests for fire support within the maneuver element to prevent fratricide as the result of friendly fire support. the fist advises the commander on any fire support coordination measures (fscms) in effect. note. risks are always present when employing fires. everyone involved with the planning, coordinating, and delivery of fires is responsible for evaluating and managing the risks. (refer to atp 5-19 for more information.) augmenting combat power 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 6-3 basic fire support tasks 6-12. effectiveness of the fire support effort is measured by creating desired effects on the enemy, setting conditions for decisive operations, and supporting joint force operations. effective fire support depends on planning for the successful performance of the following four basic fire support tasks: support forces in contact. the commander provides responsive fire support that protects and ensures freedom of maneuver to forces in contact with the enemy throughout the operational area. support the concept of operation. the concept of operations (conops) clearly and concisely expresses what the commander intends to accomplish and how it will be done using available resources. the concept of fires describes how fires will be synchronized and integrated to support the commander’s objectives as articulated in the conops. synchronize joint fire support. fire support is synchronized through fire support coordination, beginning with the commander’s visualization and conops. fire support is planned both continuously and concurrently with the development of the scheme of maneuver. further, operations providing fire support is synchronized with other force operations (for example, air operations, information collection functions, so, and io) in order to optimize the application of limited resources, achieve synergy, and avoid fratricide. sustain joint fire support operations. fire support planners formulate fire support plans to reflect logistic limitations and to exploit logistic capabilities. ammunition, fuel, food, water, maintenance, transportation, and medical support are all critical to sustaining fire support operations. types of fir es 6-13. in fire planning, consider the following types of fires — fires not only in front of the force, but also to the flanks and rear. the commander and fso usually plans one third of the maximum range of organic fire support to stay behind the forward line of troops. massed fires on choke points and key terrain to canalize, slow, and block the enemy movement. fires to suppress bypassed enemy pockets of resistance until friendly maneuver elements are safely past. suppressive fires and other fires may then be needed to support follow-on force actions against the bypassed forces. fires that do not create obstacles and barriers to friendly forces and limit forward progress. desired effects 6-14. desired effects describe the lethal and nonlethal effects fires (including ew systems) that need to be achieved against a specific target. the company commander can use numerous terms to describe desired effects, with the most common being deceive, degrade, delay, deny, destroy, disrupt, divert, exploit, interdict, influence, neutralize, and suppress. (refer to adrp 3-09 for more information.) effects 6-15. an effect is — the physical or behavioral state of a system that results from an action, a set of actions, or another effect. the result, outcome, or consequence of an action. a change to a condition, behavior, or degree of freedom as the result, outcome, or consequence of an action. 6-16. army and joint doctrine describe effects in two ways: direct effect. a direct effect is the proximate, first-order consequence of an action, such as the destruction of a target by precision-guided munitions. direct effects are immediate and easily recognizable. indirect effect. an indirect effect is a delayed or displaced consequence associated with the action that caused the direct effect. indirect effects often are less observable or recognizable chapter 6 6-4 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 than direct effects, particularly when they involve changes in an adversary’s behavior. however, an indirect effect may be the one desired. allocation 6-17. decisions on allocations of fires are based on the decisive operation, the task of each unit, and the expected enemy capabilities. the commander ensures all fires assets are addressed to include target acquisition (ta). allocation may be expressed as specific targets, numbers of targets/zones for planning purposes, or as assets available (for example, 1x fa plt ds to alpha co). priority of fires is addressed for planned activities but can change based on a change to the enemy coa, completion of events, or planned branches and sequels. positioning guidance 6-18. positioning guidance provides instructions for the movement of fires assets and observer positioning to support the scheme of maneuver. positioning guidance should highlight any specific changes to the unit basic load, if necessary for special missions. the positioning guidance should address the commander’s summary report (csr) particularly if it impacts successful mission accomplishment. an example of positioning guidance is as follows: “mtr plt iprtf vic nlt h+20 and support 1st plt breach vic obj chiefs. ensure 40 min x 400 of smoke on hand. 2d plt establish op1 vic 7081 with laser designating capability. csr limited to 10 he/ 5 smk/ 3 illum.” attack guidance 6-19. attack guidance describes which delivery systems are to be used to attack specific target types and the criteria that needs to be met before processing the target. initial attack guidance is usually provided from a higher headquarters order and should be modified as needed based on mission analysis and coa development. attack guidance is usually articulated in a matrix format. it also may be included in the following products: high-payoff target list (hptl). target selection standards (tss). attack guidance matrix (agm). restrictions 6-20. restrictions describe constraints in terms of requiring something to do or prohibiting an action. some considerations include restrictions on ammunition expenditures, types of fires, areas of employment, creation of obstacles, limiting risk to friendly troops, minimizing the loss of civilian life, and permissive and restrictive fscms. examples of restrictions are: “no cratering munitions on hwy 322. no occupation or use of incendiary munitions in built up areas. cfl pl blue, o/o pl red. nfa 1- 2 in effect.” clearance of fires 6-21. the maneuver commander is the final authority to approve (clear) fires and their effects within his zone or ao. although the commander may delegate authority to coordinate and clear fires to his fso, the ultimate responsibility belongs to the commander. during certain operations, especially in stability tasks, it may take a bct commander or a division commander to approve fires. usually, the fso assists the commander by recommending the clearance of fires and provides an assessment of collateral damage if necessary. using bft/jcr allows request fires digitally by highlighting the call-for -fire box on the bft/jcr supporting arms liaison team (salt) report tab or using a traditional call-for -fire format. once the fso receives this request via bft/jcr, he clears the request through the company commander. if the company commander approves the request, the fso then forwards the request through the fire support channels via fm or the advanced field artillery tactical data system (afatds). obscuration and screening 6-22. leaders have a variety of smoke munitions available to achieve the desired effects. since weather conditions can affect obscuration, the company commander ensures that they set the conditions for the proper employment and placement of smoke to enable the mission with respect to adjacent units that may be affected. augmenting combat power 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 6-5 6-23. when used correctly smoke can significantly reduce the enemy’s effectiveness both in daytime and at night. use smoke to reduce the ability of the enemy to deliver effective fires, to hamper hostile operations, and to deny the enemy information on friendly positions and maneuvers. smoke reduces the effectiveness of laser beams and inhibits electro-optical systems including some night vision devices. the four types of smoke are — obscuring smoke is placed on or near the enemy to suppress enemy observers and to minimize their vision. screening smoke is a smoke curtain used on the battlefield between enemy observation points and friendly units to mask friendly forces, positions, and activities. deception smoke is a smoke curtain used to deceive and confuse the enemy as to the nature of friendly operations. signaling smoke is used to establish a reference for friendly forces. 6-24. use obscuring smoke to — defeat flash ranging and restrict the enemy’s counterfire program. obscure enemy observation posts and reduce their ability to provide accurate target location for enemy fire support assets. obscure enemy direct fire weapons and lasers. instill apprehension and increase enemy patrolling. slow enemy vehicles to blackout speeds. increase control problems by preventing effective visual signals and increasing radio traffic. defeat night observation devices and reduce the capability of most ir devices. 6-25. use screening smoke for — deceptive screens. smoke draws fire. deceptive screens cause the enemy to disperse his fires and expend his ammunition. flank screens. smoke may be used to screen exposed flanks. areas forward of the objective. smoke helps the maneuver units consolidate on the objective unhindered by enemy ground observers. river crossing operations. screening the primary crossing site denies the enemy information. deceptive screens deceive the enemy as to the exact location of the main crossing. obstacle breaching. the enemy is denied the ability to observe breaching unit activities. illumination 6-26. illumination fires (visible or infrared) are useful in exposing an opponent at night. illumination fires may give friendly forces an advantage by reducing the enemy forces’ ability to operate at night without being targeted and attacked with minimal collateral damage. infrared illu mination enhances the soldier’s use of some night vision devices to more easily locate targets and enable surprise fires on enemy forces not equipped with night vision devices. field artillery 6-27. fa is the maneuver commander’s principal means for providing in direct fs to his maneuver forces. fa can neutralize, suppress, or destroy enemy direct fire forces, attack enemy artillery and mortars, provide battlefield obscuration, and deliver fascam to isolate and interdict enemy forces, or to protect friendly operations. fa elements within maneuver organizations serve as the integrating center for all elements of fs. fa delivery systems include cannons, rockets, and missiles. these systems can provide fires under all conditions of weather and in all types of terrain. they can shift and mass fires rapidly without having to displace. mortars 6-28. the mortar platoon organic to the sbct infantry battalions can augment the company mortars to provide more responsive indirect fires. battalion mortars provide close, immediately responsive fire support for committed companies. these fires harass, suppress, neutralize, and destroy enemy attack chapter 6 6-6 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016formations and defenses; obscure the enemy’s vision; and inhibit the enemy’s ability to maneuver. mortars can be used for final protective fires, smoke, and illumination. 6-29. the sbct infantry battalion commander decides how and when to integrate mortars, as a key fire support asset, into his operations plan. however, since they are fire support assets, the battalion fso should give advice and make recommendations to the commander. the battalion commander may specify mortar support for subordinate units by changing the command relationship, assigning priority of fires, or assigning priority targets. the company commander and fso should integrate their mortar section to cover targets to support in the company scheme maneuver and engage plan targets that may not be covered by the battalion mortar platoon. section iii – protection 6-30. protection tasks and systems reduce risk, mitigate identified vulnerabilities, and act on opportunity. the tasks and systems that comprise the protection warfighting function effectively protect the force, enhance the preservation of combat power, and increase the probability of mission success. the sbct infantry rifle company commander integrates and synchronizes organic and augmented forces that support their own and higher echelons protection tasks with their operations. (refer to adrp 3-37 for more information.) 6-31. the 14 protection tasks and systems are — air and missile defense. personnel recovery. operational area security. antiterrorism. survivability. force health protection. cbrn. employ safety techniques (including fratricide). operations security. provide explosive ordnance disposal (eod) and protection support. intelligence support to protection. physical security procedures. law and order. internment and resettlement. 6-32. the following paragraphs discuss the seven protection tasks and systems that the sbct infantry rifle company encounter that have not been previous explained. air and missile defense 6-33. air defense artillery is to provide fires to protect the force and selected geopolitical assets from aerial attack, missile attack, and surveillance. the sbct infantry rifle company operates with air defense systems and synchronize operations to ensure that the air defense systems are protected from a ground threat to ensure the higher unit’s commander’s protection plan is implemented accordingly. amd elements protect installations and personnel from over-the-horizon strike by conventional and cbrne warheads according to mett-tc. 6-34. indirect fire protection systems protect forces from threats that are largely immune to air defense artillery systems. the indirect fire protection intercept capability is designed to detect and destroy incoming rocket, artillery, and mortar fires. this capability assesses the threat to maintain friendly protection and destroys the incoming projectile at a safe distance from the intended target. 6-35. the amd task consists of active and passive measures that protect personnel and physical assets from an air or missile attack. passive measures include camouflage, cover, concealment, hardening, and augmenting combat power 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 6-7 opsec. active measures are taken to destroy, neutralize, or reduce the effectiveness of hostile air and missile threats. (refer to adrp 3-37 for more information .) the threat 6-36. in analyzing the physical variable of a battalion’s operational environment, planners must take into account the airspace above the battalion’s ao. s ome areas to consider include: location of threat airfields and launching points. range of aircraft and missiles. physical constraints in the friendly ao. buildings and other structures. power lines and antennas. hills, trees, and other natural barriers to movement and observation. weather. 6-37. the following are some of the types of air threats and typical maneuvers that the battalion can expect to encounter against a well-equipped enemy: unmanned aerial vehicles (uav’s) are small and elusive. they usu ally fly low, but the altitude can vary. once in the target area, they may fly an orbit attempting to stay out of engagement range of ada. most surface-launched cruise missiles follow the terrain and use terrain masking. due to their range, they might take indirect approach routes. ballistic missiles are not terrain-dependent. they fly from launch point to objective. their flight is not restricted by terrain. tactical air-to -surface missiles usually fly direct routes from launch platform to the target. rotary-wing aircraft primarily conduct contour flights. they follow ridgelines and military crests, using the terrain to mask their approach to the target area. fixed-wing aircraft usually follow major terrain or man-made features. depending on range, they may fly a straight line to the target. ordnance or payload can affect range and altitude of the air system and, thus, influence the selection of avenues of approach for airborne and air assault operations. 6-38. units can expect the threat to attempt to counter u.s. defensive and offensive operations with a myriad of aerial platforms. uas provide the threat commander the necessary information to determine friendly unit locations, movements, and objectives. aerial and artillery strikes can be generated from th e intelligence gathered against the following targets: maneuver force. forward arming and refueling points. aviation bases. command and control nodes. reserve troop concentrations. forward support company areas. terrain features. obstacles constricting unit movements as u.s. forces advance to close with the enemy forces. 6-39. lethal uas can be effective in disabling mission command, and intelligence facilities or destroying armored vehicles. the threat probably will use cruise missiles against logistical concentration, mission command nodes, or with submunitions for area denial. it probably will use rotary wing aircraft to attack forward elements and the flanks of the advancing enemy maneuver force to slow their tempo, cause confusion and, thereby, inflict maximum casualties. rotary wing aircraft also can be used to conduct operations across forward line of own troops (flot), cas, and air insertion operations. armed attack helicopters constitute the most widespread and capable air threats to friendly ground forces in the close battle. chapter 6 6-8 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016passive air defense 6-40. soldiers use passive air defense measures to avoid detection from enemy air attack. passive air defense is all measures, other than active air defense, taken to minimize the effectiveness of hostile air and missile threats against friendly forces and assets. these measures include camouflage, concealment, deception, dispersion, reconstitution, redundancy, detection and warning systems, and the use of protective construction. (jp 3-01) concealing large vehicles like the abrams tank and bradley fighting vehicle (bfv) is difficult. commanders should consider deception techniques to disguise their intentions and active air defense. damage -limiting measures 6-41. damage-limiting measures are attempts to limit any damages should the enemy detect friendly forces. these measures are used when units are in a static position such as an assembly area, or when they are maneuvering. if caught in the open, personnel should immediately execute battle drills and move to positions of cover and concealment that reduce the enemy's ability to acquire or engage them. the same measures taken to limit damage from artillery attack are used for dispersion, protective construction, and cover. examples of damage-limiting measures include vehicle dispersion, camouflage, and dug-in fighting positions with overhead protection. active air defense 6-42. although passive measures are the first line of defense against air attack, troops must be prepared to engage attacking enemy aircraft. the decision to fight an air threat is based on the immediate situation and weapons system capabilities. based on the mission, companies do not typically engage aircraft except for self-preservation or as directed by the battalion or company commander. engagement techniques 6-43. the crew’s goal is to engage and destroy or suppress targets as fast as possible. basic engagement procedures used for all engagements include: the vehicle commander might be required to lay the gun for direction if the gunner’s scan is away from the target. he will release control to the gunner (target hand-off) and issue the fire command. once the target is acquired, the gunner identifies and discriminates the target. the vehicle commander then confirms the target and gives the fire command. the gunner completes his switch checks. smalls arms used for air defense 6-44. small arms used for air defense incorporate the use of volume fire and proper aiming points according to the target. the key to success in engaging enemy air is to put out a high volume of fire. all weapons designated by the commander should be used, including stryker vehicles, humwvs and trucks, and infantry direct fire automatic weapons. the commander must decide whether to engage and must provide the engagement command for the entire unit to fire upon the attacking aircraft rather than having soldiers fire at the aircraft individually. survivability 6-45. survivability includes all aspects of protecting personnel, weapons, and supplies while simultaneously deceiving the enemy. survivability tactics include building a good defense; employing frequent movement; using concealment, deception, and camouflage; and constructing fighting and protective positions for both individuals and equipment. 6-46. survivability operations are the development and construction of protective positions (such as earth berms, dug-in positions, overhead protection, and counter surveillance means) to reduce the effectiveness of enemy weapons systems. survivability operations range from employing camouflage, concealment, and deception to include the supporting task of battlefield obscuration to hardening facilities, mission command nodes, and critical infrastructure. augmenting combat power 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 6-9 6-47. survivability operations often enable other protection tasks and systems, to include amd, operational area security, antiarmor, and cbrn. survivability operations also provide support to the movement and maneuver warfighting function by conducting mobility and countermobility operations. 6-48. commanders may call on engineers to support the protection efforts. augmented engineers to the sbct can mass their skills and equipment to develop defensive positions into fortifications or strongpoint’s and improve defensive positions. they provide survivability applications to host nation facilities and u.s.-operated facilities to include entry control points, guard towers, and other means of hardening. 6-49. while survivability operations are traditionally recognized as an engineer task, units at all echelons have an inherent responsibility to improve their positions, whether a fighting position, bunker, or forward operating bases ( fob ). survivability consists of four areas that are designed to reemphasize efforts toward mitigating friendly losses to hostile actions or environments. they are as follows: mobility. maintaining freedom of movement is usually the sbct engineer company’s primary effort when conducting offense, defense, and operations to support stability tasks. situational understanding. situational understanding is the product of applying analysis and judgment to relevant information to determine the relationship between the mission variables to facilitate decision making (adrp 3-0). it requires the ability to identify, process, and comprehend the critical elements of information about what occurs inside the commander’s ao. having accurate situational understanding provides the baseline for hazard assessments note. the situational understanding of terrain, through proper terrain analysis, is important to survivability and the development of survivability positions, minimizing the requirements to adjust terrain and leading to the efficient use of survivability assets. hardening. hardening is the act of using natural or man-made materials to protect personnel, equipment, or facilities. hardening measures protect resources from blast, direct and indirect fire, heat, radiation, or ew. hardening is accomplished by using barriers, walls, shields, berms, or other types of physical protection. it is intended to defeat or negate the effects of an attack and includes fighting positions, protective positions, armored vehicles, soldiers, and information systems. the stryker vehicles can engage targets without exposing their hull if behind a hardened position. camouflage, concealment, and deception. camouflage, concealment, and deception use materials and techniques to hide, blend, disguise, decoy, or disrupt the appearance of military targets and their backgrounds to prevent visual and electronic detection of friendly forces. camouflage, concealment, and deception help prevent an enemy from detecting or identifying friendly troops, equipment, activities, or installations and include battlefield obscuration capabilities to obscure, screen, mark, or deceive. battlefield obscuration is a major supporting task of camouflage, concealment, and deception and is typically provided by specialized cbrn elements or fires. force health protection 6-50. force health protection includes measures taken by commanders, leaders, individual soldiers, and the military health system to promote, improve, or conserve the behavioral and physical well-being of soldiers. these measures enable a healthy and fit force, prevent injury and illness, and protect the force from health hazards. it includes the prevention aspects of several army medical department functions, such as — preventive medicine to include medical surveillance and occupational and environmental health surveillance. veterinary services, including food safety, food security, quality assurance, animal care missions, and the prevention of animal borne diseases transmissible to man. combat and operational stress control. laboratory services to include area medical laboratory (aml) support. dental services to include preventive dentistry. chapter 6 6-10 atp 3-21.11 4 february 20166-51. army personnel need to be physically and behaviorally fit. this requirement demands programs that promote and improve the capacity of personnel to perform military tasks at high levels, under extreme conditions, and for extended period. these preventive and protective capabilities include physical exercise, nutritional diets, dental hygiene and restorative treatment, combat and operational stress management, rest, recreation, and relaxation that are geared to individual or organizations. (refer to adrp 3-37 for more information.) chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear 6-52. cbrn are the employment of tactical capabilities that counter the entire range of cbrn threats and hazards through cbrne proliferation prevention, cbrne counterforce, cbrn defense, and cbrn consequence management activities. in turn these support operational and strategic objectives to combat cbrne and operate safely in cbrn environments. cbrn threats and hazards include cbrne, improvised weapons and devices, and toxic industrial materials (tim) and can potentially cause mass casualties and large-scale destruction. many state and nonstate actors (to include terrorists and criminals) possess or have the capability to possess, develop, and proliferate cbrne. u.s. policy prohibits the use of chemical or biological weapons under any circumstances, but it reserves the right to employ nuclear weapons. many potential enemies are under no such constraint. 6-53. protecting soldiers from the harmful hazards associated with cbrn attacks in an ao is essential to preserving combat power. when the probability of cbrn threat exists, commanders and leaders conduct a deliberate analysis to posture and equip forces for survival and mission effectiveness. cbrn personnel consider mett-tc and related information to provide recommendations on protection requirements that are reflected in the mission-oriented protective posture (mopp) level. staff and leader involvement ensures safe and sustained operations under various climatic conditions. commanders should develop standard responses and coas for each projected mission. the standard mopp levels are — mopp ready. carry a protective mask, and ensure that individual protective gear is available within 2 hours. a second set needs to be available in 6 hours. mopp0. carry a protective mask, and ensure that individual protective gear is available, within arm’s reach. mopp1. don an overgarment. mopp2. don protective boots. mopp3. don a protective mask. mopp4. don protective gloves. 6-54. leaders know that they cannot expect the same work rates in mopp4 as they achieved in mopp0. they reevaluate the ability to meet mission requirements and communicate changes to the force. mopp reduction decisions are between the most difficult to make because of the many considerations that affect the final decision. the cbrn reconnaissance platoon in the brigade engineer battalion (beb) assists in the decision-making process by confirming or denying the presence of a cbrn threat through reconnaissance. commanders evaluate the situation from the intelligence of the threats capabilities and intentions and the risks associated with operations. factors include the criticality of the established mission, potential effects of personnel exposure, and the impact on the casualty care system. commanders can then determine what follow-on coas to employ. 6-55. leaders determine the appropriate mopp level by assessing mett-tc factors and weighing the impact of increased protection levels. higher headquarters provides mopp level directives to subordinate elements. (refer to fm 3-11.4 for more information.) employ safety techniques 6-56. safety needs to be considered as part of planning for all missions. operational conditions often impose significant hazards to soldiers through the increased probability of an accidental event. in an extreme oe, these hazards raise the risk level as equipment and personnel are taxed. leaders need to know their soldiers and trained crews, and operators need to know the capabilities and limitations of their platforms and systems. to maintain a continuous operational tempo, commanders need to know how to employ and sustain personnel and equipment. when planning operations, commanders — augmenting combat power 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 6-11 consider human endurance limits and environmental conditions. balance the possible benefits of sustained, high-tempo operations with the level of risk. accept no unnecessary risks. conduct high-risk operations only when the potential gain or benefit outweighs the potential loss. 6-57. integrating safety into the operations process through the protection warfighting function and the risk management process provides an opportunity to identify and assess hazards to the force and develop risk reduction measures. the responsibility for safety starts with the commander and continues through the chain of command to individuals. safety works best when all leaders and soldiers receive training to recognize hazards and implement controls to reduce or mitigate risks in their daily operations. (refer to atp 5-19 for more information .) 6-58. fratricide and friendly fire are the unintentional killing of friendly personnel by friendly firepower. the destructive power and range of modern weapons, coupled with the high intensity and rapid tempo of combat, increase the potential for fratricide and friendly fire. tactical maneuvers, terrain, and weather conditions may increase the danger of fratricide and friendly fire. (see chapter 1 of this publication.) 6-59. sbct infantry rifle companies need to pay close attention to surface danger zones (sdzs) when conducting operations. with the addition of more crew served weapons, rws, mgs, and infantry; weapon capability awareness is much more of a factor. the stryker vehicle is designed to be a carrier and not a combat vehicle. the technique is to deploy soldiers from the vehicle before making contact. this can often lead to infantry being forward of the vehicles and their weapon systems and in their sdzs. leaders should plan means of mounted maneuver with dismounted elements to avoid potential fratricide. operations security 6-60. opsec is the process of identifying essential elements of friendly information and analyzing friendly actions attendant to military operations and other activities to — identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems. determine indicators hostile intelligence systems might obtain that could be interpreted or pieced together to derive critical information in time to be useful to adversaries. select and execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities of friendly actions to adversary exploitation. 6-61. opsec applies to all operations across the range of military operations. all units conduct opsec to preserve essential secrecy. commanders establish routine opsec measures in unit sops. explosive ordnance disposal 6-62. the mission of eod is to eliminate or reduce the effects of explosive ordnance (eo) hazards to protect combat power. eo hazards are frequently increasing dangers in the modern combat. they limit mobility, deny the use of critical assets, and threaten to injure or kill soldiers at levels unprecedented in the past. u.s. and multinational use of munitions that disperse submunitions across a wide area has led to increased amounts of uxo on the battlefield. eod forces are trained, equipped, and organized to deal with the increased quantity, sophistication, and lethality of eo and support u.s. and multinational forces across the range of military operations. improvised explosive device defeat (ied defeat ) 6-63. the ied defeat framework is derived from the fundamentals of assured mobility. assured mobility encompasses those actions that provide commanders with the ability to deploy, move, and maneuver where and when they desire (without interruption or delay) and to achieve the mission. (refer to fm 3-34 for more information.) the fundamentals of assured mobility assist in developing sa for the commander that allows them to exploit opportunities to defeat the ied before its inception. 6-64. because all ieds will not be eliminated, the commander plans to mitigate the impact by developing sops, tactics, techniques, and procedures (ttps), battle drills, and other responsive means to lessen the effects of the ied or eliminate the enemy’s desired outcome. to effectively mitigate the impact of ieds, chapter 6 6-12 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 the fundamentals of detect, avoid, neutralize, and protect are used in conjunction with mett-tc to plan and develop coordinated and well-executed responses. 6-65. the commander conducts clearing operations in support of an overall ied defeat mission. the reemphasis of clearing operations is on the ied or explosive hazard itself. however, the device is merely the end product of a complex set of enemy activities. an ied attack is the result of a planned attack with several key elements that work in a coordinated and synchronized manner to attain a desired result . collection of biometric identity data enables the commander to attack the ied human network and enable the route clearing tasks for the very same reason. 6-66. route clearance is an enabling task in ied defeat. it provides the maneuver commander the capability to employ a combined arms force of combat engineers, eod, and other units task-organized, equipped, and trained to neutralize the ied threat along critical routes. route provides one of a number of solutions the commander may employ to defeat this type of threat. a cleared route is only clear as long as it is under friendly observation. (refer to atp 3-90.37 for more information.) section iv – aviation 6-67. army aviation uses maneuver to concentrate and sustain combat power at critical times and places to find, fix, and destroy threat forces. aviation units design, tailor, and configure their assets in support of the sbct infantry rifle company for specific operational support based on mission guidance and the specific area of responsibility (aor) in which the units operate. the organization could be a combination of attack reconnaissance, assault, lift, and maintenance units. (refer to fm 3-52 for more information.) air-ground operations 6-68. today’s operational environment requires combined arms at all levels, ther efore, the likelihood of sbct infantry rifle company commanders receiving attack and utility aviation for support is ever increasing. the following are some considerations for the company commander when receiving aviation assets: exchange of frequencies, call signs, and fm check-in times. terrain model and radio rehearsals. location of air corridors and air control points. location of aerial attack by fire (abf)/sbf/bps. identification method for marking ground targets. aircraft weapons configuration and station times. friendly recognition symbols for both aircraft and ground vehicles. fire coordination measures. location and marking of lzs and pzs for medevac, casevac, and aerial resupply. 6-69. ground maneuver commanders understand that aviation forces can provide a significant advantage during operations. the company commander must understand that the unique capabilities of army aviation require unique planning and coordination. direct fire aviation missions in the close fight differ greatly from engagements in a cross-forward line of own troops (flot) operation. in a cross-flot operation, attack aircraft can benefit from deliberate planning and freely engaging at maximum ranges with minimal concern of fratricide. engagements in the close fight, on the other hand, often result in engagements within enemy direct fire weapons system ranges that are close to friendly units. the tlps need to integrate army aviation forces to ensure effective combined arms employment. effective combined arms employment requires that aviation and ground maneuver forces synchronize their operations by operating from a common perspective. the following paragraphs highlight some possible procedures that aid in creating a common air-ground perspective. cas and cca execution 6-70. the alo and jtac personnel in the tacp are the primary means for requesting and controlling cas. however, reconnaissance units conducting shaping operations, such as reconnaissance and augmenting combat power 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 6-13 surveillance missions that have joint fires observer certified personnel, may observe and request cas through the jtac. 6-71. any element in contact uses the cca 5-line attack brief to initiate the cca. the cca 5-line attack brief allows the ground maneuver forces to communicate and reconfirm to the aircraft the exact location of friendly and enemy forces. the ground commander owning the terrain clears fires during the cca by giving aircrews the situational awareness of the location of friendly elements. the ground commander deconflicts the airspace between indirect fires, cas, and the cca aircraft. ground maneuver force and target marking 6-72. the rapid and accurate marking of a target is essential to a positive target handover. aircraft conducting ccas will develop an attack plan that is mett-tc dependent and meets the ground commander’s task and purpos e. the aircrew generally has an extremely limited amount of time to acquire both the friendly and enemy locations. attack reconnaissance aircrews use both thermal sight and night vision goggles (nvg) to fly with and acquire targets. 6-73. marking methods for identifying targets and friendly positions vary from one ground maneuver force to another. request should include a detailed description of all friendly locations and target locations in relation to friendly positions. it should include the target description and how it is marked. 6-74. for mutual protection and clarity on the appropriate target, the ground maneuver force does not mark the target until requested by the aviation element. this in no way restricts the ground maneuver force from returning fire from the enemy. however, the ground maneuver force should consider that the aircrews may not be able to distinguish the correct target from other fires if they mark the target with fire. visual markings can be viewed by the enemy force and provide them early warning to an attack from the air. ground maneuver forces should have multiple means of marking their positions. if the target is marked by fire, the aviation element requests the ground maneuver force to stop marking. the aviation element calls when clear of the area and reports estimated bda. handover 6-75. the ground forces commander ensures that effects from fires both direct and indirect systems are not endangering air assets prior to handing over the engagement to air assets. ground forces normally require means to suppress or fix the enemy in position within moments before the air asset engages the targets. 6-76. aircraft normally rely on a high rate of speed and low altitude for survivability in the target area. as such, the aircrew generally has an extremely limited amount of time to acquire both the friendly and enemy marks. the ground maneuver force must have the marking ready and turned on when requested by the aircrew. if target is not marked the air asset may not engage, miss its target, or commit fratricide. 6-77. after initially engaging the target, the aircrew generally approaches from a different angle for survivability reasons if another attack is required. the observer makes adjustments using the eight cardinal directions and distance (meters) with the last round’s impact and the actual target. at the conclusion of the cca, the aircrew provides its best estimate of bda to the unit in contact. considerations for cca and cas execution 6-78. aircraft leaders normally offset the battle position, attack or support by fire position from the flank of the friendly ground position. this helps to ensure that minimal interfere with operations on the ground. the offset position allows the aircraft to engage the enemy on its flanks rather than its front. it reduces the risk of fratricide along gun-target line. 6-79. the engaging the target normally cannot be conducted without positive identification of friendly and enemy forces by both the ground and aviation commander before opening fire. the aviation element tailors its attack angles and weapon selections based upon the target and friendly unit proximity to the target. 6-80. cca and cas can continue until the aircraft have expended all available munitions or fuel. however, if the air element receives a request for another attack, the pilot must carefully evaluate his ability to extend the operation. if not able, the pilot calls for relief on station by another air element if available. chapter 6 6-14 atp 3-21.11 4 february 20166-81. clearance of fires considerations include― ensure aircrews have the current acms and fscms for indirect fire positions (to include mortars) supporting the ground tactical plan. plan for informal airspace coordinating areas and check firing procedures and communications to ensure artillery and mortars firing from within the lz do not endanger subsequent serials landing or departing, cca, or cas. ensure at least one of the aviation team members monitors the fs net for situational awareness. advise the aviation element if the location of indirect fire units changes from that planned. ensure all participating units are briefed daily on current aco or air tasking order changes and updates that may affect air mission planning and execution. ensure all units update firing unit locations, firing point origins, and final protective fire lines as they change for inclusion in current aco. 6-82. after receiving the request for cas/cca the aircrew informs the ground maneuver force leader of the battle position, attack- or suppo rt-by-fire position (or series of positions) the team is occupying, and the location from which the attack aircraft engages the enemy with direct fire. the size of this position varies depending on the number of aircraft using the position, the size of the engagement area, and the type of terrain. the position must be close enough to the requesting unit to facilitate efficient target handover. 6-83. the ground commander owning the terrain clears fires during the cca by giving aircrews the situational awareness of the location of friendly elements. the ground commander deconflicts the airspace between indirect fires, cas, and the cca aircraft. methods to deconflict on the objective area 6-84. the three methods to deconflict airspace for aircraft on the objective are described in the following paragraphs. grid line or terrain feature separation 6-85. this is the most restrictive but easiest method to execute. it may not allow the attack reconnaissance units to engage targets in the cca role during the air assault, but this technique is appropriate when time is limited for rehearsals, or when prior planning is extremely limited or not possible. with this method, the attack reconnaissance units clear the airspace for inbound assault units by moving to a designated grid line or terrain feature on either side of the objective. this movement and the subsequent maneuver of the attack reconnaissance units in and around the objective area are executed according to the instructions in the order. (see figure 6-1 on -15 .) augmenting combat power 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 6-15 legend: acp = air coordination point, lz = landing zone, obj = objective, rp = release point, sp = start point figure 6-1. grid line method attack- by-fire positioning 6-86. attack-by-fire positioning is the preferred method of deconfliction, as it allows attack reconnaissance aircraft the greatest flexibility to engage targets during the air assault in support of the ground tactical commander (gtc). the attack reconnaissance units occupy known attack-by-fire positions according to the published opord. this method restricts the attack reconnaissance units to the general vicinity of the attack-by-fire positions but not to a specific grid. (see figure 6-2.) 6-87. the attack-by-fire positioning method requires the attack reconnaissance units to ensure they stay clear of the lz and do not cross the centerline of the direction of flight. using this method requires the attack reconnaissance aircraft to have increased situational awareness. this method is best used when all elements have adequate time to rehearse. chapter 6 6-16 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 legend: obj = objective figure 6-2. attack-by -fire method call clear 6-88. the call clear method is used in contingency circumstances when assault or other aircraft (such as air medical evacuation or mission command aircraft) are inbound to the objective area. it is initiated with an inbound call of the assault or other aircraft to the lz and a response from the attack reconnaissance air mission command (amc) indicating that all elements of the lz and the flight path to it from the release point (rp) are clear. avoid using this method during the main air assault itself due to congestion on the air battle net. assessing battle damage assessment and reattack 6-89. after the attack aircraft complete the requested cca mission, the aircrew provides a bda to the ground commander. based on his intent, the ground maneuver commander determines if another attack is required to achieve his desired end state. release from support /retasking 6-90. upon identification that air support is no longer required the ground forces release the supporting air elements from bottom up echelons. higher level echelons always have the authority to retask and reassign air assets based upon mett-tc. lower levels ensure that support is met within their higher level commander’s intent to support ground maneuver. the ground for ces do this by submitting closing reports after air support is completed its tasks. augmenting combat power 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 6-17 respond to downed aircraft 6-91. response to downed aircraft is always a planning consideration for all air assets and supported ground forces. when an aircraft is downed the nearest ground element immediately moves to secure the area, recover personnel and equipment. various echelons have differing tasks to support downed aircraft and personnel recovery. typically the sequence of events goes in order of — determine location of downed aircraft. closest ground element moves to site. secure site and units rotate if needed to conduct follow on operations. search for missing personnel and equipment. destroy items that cannot be recovered if needed based on mett-tc. form a recovery team. recover equipment. follow up tasks and accountability of secondary effects. investigation for cause. implement findings of investigation. 6-92. follow on operations will occur while the downed aircraft is being secured or recovered. the responding unit must be aware of the actions they take as well as what they notice when they arrive onsite. the timeliness of their response mitigates the effort and impact and scope of the follow operations. air movement 6-93. air movement operations are conducted to reposition units, personnel, supplies, equipment, and other critical combat elements in support of current or future operations. these operations include both airdrops and air landings. 6-94. the sbct conducts air movement with its vehicle by fixed wing. each stryker infantry rifle company should have at least one trained unit movement officer. the stryker vehicle have the following capabilities and limitation for air movement: capabilities: many of the stryker vehicles are able to be transported by c-130 and heavier aircraft. ability to deploy rapidly for global response if lift assets are available. limitations: the stryker vehicle cannot travel and land ready to fight. it requires fitting with additional armament, fueling, mission command system data upload and loading ammunition. the aircraft carrying a stryker vehicle require a secure airfield to land. 6-95. planning for air movements with the stryker vehicles and without them is similar to that for other missions. besides the normal planning process, air movement planning need to cover specific requirements. they are as follows: coordinate with the supporting aviation unit(s). plan and rehearse with the supporting aviation unit before the mission if possible. if armed escort accompanies the operation, the company commander —and the assault or general support aviation unit —should ensure that aircrews are included in the planning and rehearsal. gather as much intelligence as possible, such as the enemy situation, in preparation for the mission. plan and coordinate joint suppression of enemy air defense (j-sead). 6-96. the unit should plan different ingress and egress routes, covering the following: planned insertion and extraction points. emergency extraction rally points. lost communications extraction points. chapter 6 6-18 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 6-97. planned extraction points and emergency extraction rally points require communications to verify the preplanned pickup time or coordinate an emergency pickup time window when dismounted. planning need to include details for extraction when communications between higher headquarters and the unit are lost. the lost communications extraction point involves infiltration teams moving to the emergency extraction point after two consecutive missed communications windows and waiting up to 24 hours for pickup. air resupply 6-98. the sbct infantry rifle company and subordinate units may operate in forward locations and even distant hide positions requiring helicopter resupply to include both internal and external load operations. 6-99. planning for aerial resupply requires close coordination, with elements reviewing the entire mission and resolving all limitations and problem areas. if a resupply item poses a problem that cannot be resolved, leaders should consider another mode of transport. planning factors include the following: priorities of cargo/unit resupply. integration of the resupply operation into the tactical plan. selection, identification, and marking of the pz/lz. type/amount of cargo. helicopter assets available. requirements for slings, cargo nets, or cargo containers. ground crew training requirements, such as those for ground guides and hookup personnel. pz and lz security. flight routes. 6-100. the selection of a usable pz or lz is extremely important. the company analyzes logistical and tactical considerations taking into account that pz/lz positioning is at the right place to support the ground unit. the area must be accessible to the aircraft involved in the resupply operation. the air mission commander, the pilot in command, an aviation liaison officer (alo), or a pathfinder-qualified officer or nco make the final decision on pz/lz selection and acceptance. 6-101. the sbct infantry rifle company receiving the supplies is responsible for preparing the pz/lz. besides the general pz/lz responsibilities, soldiers in the company perform the following specific tasks for aerial resupply: recover and assemble equipment and supplies. train available ground crews in guiding the aircraft during approach, landing, unloading/loading, departure, and de-rigging the load. train hookup personnel. coordinate with t he sending unit for the control and return of that unit’s transport equipment such as slings and (aerial delivery cargo bag, nsn 1670-00-587-3421) a-22 bags. prepare, coordinate, and inspect backloads, such as slings and a-22 bags, and have them ready for hookup or loading when the aircraft arrives. section v – military information support operations (miso) 6-102. military information support (mis) forces provide the commander with an increased ability to degrade the enemy’s will to fight, reduce civilian interfer ence, minimize collateral damage, and increase relevant and local population support for operations. these forces operate as three 5-man teams, and are integrated with maneuver units to conduct miso in support of unified land operations. a staff sergeant leads the mis team and advises the commander on the use of information, and is responsible for the integration and employment of the team. the team leader serves as a planner in the absence of a mis planner on the supported unit’s staff. 6-103. company commanders align themes and messages during operations that are nested with the sbct commanders. messages and themes that a company commander initiates should be submitted to their supporting battalion and be analyzed by the miso to determine the possible reach of the theme and message. messages and themes often cross over company and battalion aos. augmenting combat power 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 6-19 capabilities 6-104. miso capabilities include — influencing foreign populations through planned messages, activities, and actions that target select individuals and populations to affect decision making and change behavior. advising the commander on the psychological effects of military actions in the oe, and providing cultural expertise. delivering messages to intended audiences to inform, influence, and direct. collecting, processing, and analyzing information to enhance the commander’s understanding of the oe and to facilitate decision making. training, advising, and assisting government organizations and security forces to establish hn/partner nation (pn) information capabilitie s. planning considerations 6-105. planning and employment considerations for miso include — approval authority. messages and actions intended to influence foreign populations need to comply with higher-level programs, plans, objectives, themes, and orders. the program approval may or may not authorize the gcc to further delegate approval authority to subordinate commanders as low as the brigade level for select products and actions. when the bct commander has this authority, he determines the length and timeliness of the approval process at his level. mis element leaders are obligated to operate within the established approval process and to ensure the maneuver commander does not deliberately or inadvertently violate policies or the approval process. interpreter. when language requirements exceed the abilities of the mis team members, an interpreter is required. security. mis teams rely on the supported unit to provide security. intelligence. miso activities require accurate, predictive, continuous, and timely intelligence to assess changes in decision making and actions. mobility. mission analysis determines if organic transportation assets of the mis team are adequate for the terrain to be navigated. provisions for transporting team members, equipment, and products may be needed in difficult terrain or conditions. themes, messages, and actions 6-106. mission command requires the commander to use overarching information themes, supported by synchronized messages, and integrated with complimentary actions to achieve a desired end state. in doing so, leaders personally engage key players to ensure the themes and messages are transmitted and received as the command intends. in an information-saturated environment, messages, themes, and actions are inextricably linked. information as an element of combat power is a critical and sometimes decisive factor in mission success. 6-107. a message is a verbal, written, or electronic communications supporting an information theme focused on an audience and in support of a specific action or objective. a psychological action (psyact) is planned for its psychological impact and conducted to influence decision making and subsequent actions of selected target audiences. (refer to fm 3-13 and fm 3-53 for more information.) accurate, timely, and synchronized messages delivered to the right audiences and integrated with effective actions —increase the pressure on the enemy. this is extremely important in dealing with friendly, neutral and threat audiences, and where synchronized and integrated actions and messages create significant opportunities to gain support for operations. 6-108. properly employed, information themes and messages can shape the oe and multiply the effects of friendly successes while countering threat or enemy information efforts. an information theme usually produced by the sbct or higher, is a unifying or dominant idea or image expressing the purposes for an action. company commanders should incorporate higher commanders’ themes and messages into all actions the company conducts. proper employment of themes and messages begins during planning, chapter 6 6-20 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016continues through execution, and requires continuous assessment. company commanders need to leverage all available assets in order to ensure both the appropriateness and best method of delivery of themes and messages to the target audience within their ao. additionally, during planning, company commanders should establish a collection plan to assess the effectiveness and impact of the messages and themes within their ao. information-related capabilities 6-109. information-related capabilities of inform and influence activity is a military capability or activity specifically designed to influence, inform, or inform and influence select leaders, decision makers, and audiences whose behaviors and perceptions are deemed integral to mission success. information-related capabilities of iia are —public affairs (pa), military information support operations, soldier and leader engagement, combat camera, military deception, ca operations, and operations security. public affairs 6-110. pa effort factually and accurately informs various populations without intent to misinform or change behaviors. it synchronizes components of pa with other iia to ensure consistency, command credibility, and operations security. (refer to fm 3-61 for more information.) military information support operations 6-111. miso are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators directed towards foreign , friendly, neutral, threat, and enemy audiences. (refer to section vi of this chapter or fm 3-53 fo r more information.) soldier and leader engagement 6-112. soldier and leader engagement is interpersonal interactions by soldiers and leaders with audiences in an area of operations (fm 3-13). it can occur as an opportunity, a face-to -face encounter on the street, or a scheduled meeting. this interaction can also occur via telephone calls, video teleconferences, or other audiovisual mediums. soldier and leader engagement is an information-related capability that supports the commanders’ responsibility to inform an d influence audiences inside and outside their organizations. soldiers and leaders conduct engagement s to provide information or to influence attitudes, perceptions, and behavior. these engagements provide a venue for building relationships, solving conflicts, conveying information, calming fears, and refuting rumors, lies, or incorrect information. effectively integrating soldier and leader engagement into operations increases the potential for commanders to mitigate unintended consequences, counter adversary information activities, and increase local support for friendly forces and their collective mission. (refer to fm 3-13 for more information.) 6-113. face-to -face interaction by soldiers and leaders strongly influences the perceptions of the local populace. carried out with discipline, professionalism, and cultural sensitivity, day-to -day interaction of soldiers with the local populace among whom they operate has positive effects. such interaction amplifies positive actions, counters threat information, and increases goodwill and support for friendly missions. actions in keeping with the commander’s themes and messages demonstrated during operations provide an opportunity for persuasion, and reduce friction and mistrust. when conducting these meetings or engagem ents, never promise something you can’t deliver. 6-114. likewise, meetings and other engagements conducted by leaders with key communicators, civilian leaders, or others whose perceptions, decisions, and actions will affect mission accomplishment can be critical to mission success. these deliberate engagements provide the most convincing venue for conveying positive information, assuaging fears, and refuting rumors, lies, and misinformation. conducted with detailed preparation and planning, both activities often prove crucial in garnering local support for army operations, providing an opportunity for persuasion, and reducing friction and mistrust. never promise something you can’t deliver. 6-115. sbct infantry rifle company commander and subordinate leaders use information shaped by intelligence to inform, influence, and persuades the local populace within limits prescribed by their higher headquarters, other authoritative guidance, and u.s. law. they integrate inform and influence with stability tasks. they do this to counter false and distorted information and propaganda according guidance of higher augmenting combat power 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 6-21 headquarters. within the limits of opsec, leaders make the populace aware of the techniques used to provide security and control. actions on the ground reinforced by a clear and consistent message produce transparency. this transparency reinforces credibility. credibility reflects the populace’s assessment of whether the force can accomplish the mission. leaders must leave no doubt as to their capability and intentions. 6-116. sbct infantry rifle company leaders are not restricted to the above listed components when conducting iia and may add or subtract information-related capabilities as the situation dictates. information-related capabilities can support iia include combat camera, ca operations, cyber/electromagnetic activities, operations security, and other military actions as designated by the company commander. (refer to fm 3-13 for more information.) conduct negotiations 6-117. the sbct infantry rifle company, platoon, and squad may face a number of situations in which leaders need to conduct negotiations. there are two general types of negotiations, situational and planned. units conduct situational negotiations in response to a requirement for on-the-spot discussion and resolution of a specific issue or problem. (example, a unit is patrolling its ao when a local official approaches it; the local official wishes to discuss an assault that occurred in the area.) units conduct planned negotiations when they foresee a problem, or identify a situation that needs to be resolved through advanced planning or coordination. (example, the platoon leader conducts a coordination meeting, otherwise known as key leader engagement between leaders of two belligerent groups to determine route clearance responsibilities.) 6-118. at the sbct infantry rifle company platoon and squad level, situational negotiations are far more common than the planned type. in fact, employment in stability tasks requires the leader, his subordinate leaders, and other soldiers to conduct some form of negotiations almost daily. this in turn requires them to have a thorough understanding of the roe, rules of interaction (roi), and understanding of themes and messages from the higher command. 6-119. members of the sbct infantry rifle company, platoon, and squad apply this working knowledge to the process of discussing and, whenever possible, resolving issues and problems may arise between opposing parties, which may include the platoon itself. a critical aspect of this knowledge is the negotia tor’s ability to recognize that he has exhausted his options under the roe/roi and turned the discussion over to a higher authority. negotiations continue at progressive levels of authority until the issue is resolved. combat camera 6-120. combat camera units provide a powerful documentary and supports the components of inform and influence activities. combat camera provides leaders with a directed imagery capability to dsca operational and planning requirements. these forces use video documentation capabilities ranging from aerial photography to underwater photography to support iia. they access areas and events inaccessible to other personnel or media. furthermore, combat camera teams have a technological capability to transmit real-time images. the accurate portrayal provided by u.s. forces in action enables iia section to reinforce other information-related capability efforts. likewise, their documentation of operations and provided imagery products support countering misinformation or propaganda. (refer to atp 3-55.12/ mcrp 3-33.7a/nttp 3-61.2/afttp 3-2.41 for more information.) military deception 6-121. military deception involves actions executed to deliberately mislead threat military, paramilitary, or violent extremist organization decision makers. this information-related capability intends the threat to take specific actions (or inactions) contributing to accomplishment of the friendly mission. military deception does not fall under the direct purview of the s-7 but is considered a primary influencing capability of iia. 6-122. military deception comprises counter deception, deception in support of operations security, and tactical deception. chapter 6 6-22 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016cyber electromagnetic activities 6-123. given the dependence on cyberspace and the electromagnetic spectrum, leaders at all levels fully integrate cyber/electromagnetic activities within the overall operation. the components of cyber/electromagnetic activities are —cyber situational awareness, network operations, cyber warfare, electronic attack, electronic protection, electronic support, and electromagnetic spectrum operations. (refer to atp 3-36 for more information.) operations security 6-124. operations security information- related capabilities deny threat and enemy’s information in turn influences their decision making process. operations security is the process by which the army protects human and automated decision making in peacetime and in conflict. it is a commander’s responsibility and is supported by every soldier and supporting civilian staff members and operators. operations security aims to enhance the probability of mission success by preserving the advantages of initiative secrecy and surprise. operations security is a force multiplier. it includes reducing predictability and eliminating indicators of operations. leaders use operations security countermeasures to deny threat knowledge of friendly operations, requiring threat to expend further resources to obtain the critical information needed to make decisions. (refer to fm 3-13 for more information.) section vi – special operations forces 6-125. special forces (sf) may operate with the infantry or within the infantry area of operation and with infantry units conducting operations inside a joint special operations area. physical contact between infantry units and sf operation may range from short-term direct action operations to sustained combat operations. it is essential to conduct adequate coordination and integration to accomplish the specific mission. special forces operations have several elements to aid in coordination at the battalion level and above. 6-126. as part of the sbct, the infantry may conduct operations with or in support of sof in the oe. detailed planning and coordination may be required. in today’s oe, the company may find sof operating within or near its area of operation. to maximize their combined combat power, these forces need to share an appreciation and understanding of each other‘s mission, purpose, capabilities, and limitations. for more information. (refer to adp 3-05, adrp 3-05, and fm 3-05 for more information.) 6-127. when operating with or near sof, the sbct infantry rifle company commander should coordinate, at a minimum, the following with the sof unit leader: mission command relationship. communication information (frequencies, call signs, challenge and passwords, emergency signals and codes). safe house locations. number and types of vehicles. control measures being used. battle handover criteria. liaisons. sustainment plans. contingency plans for mutual support. section vii – civil affairs 6-128. ca activities performed or supported by ca personnel and organizations enhance the relationship between military forces and civil authorities in areas where military forces are present. the goal is to facilitate military operations and to consolidate and achieve u.s. objectives. these activities may occur before, during, or after military actions. they may occur, if directed, in the absence of other military operations. ca support relates to the mission command warfighting function. augmenting combat power 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 6-23 civil-military operations 6-129. tactical-level civil-military operations (cmo) include support of stakeholders at local levels, and promoting the legitimacy and effectiveness of u.s. presence and operations between locals, while minimizing friction between the military and the civilian organizations in the field. these may include local security operations, processing, and movement of displaced civilians, project management and project nomination, civil reconnaissance, and basic hss. (refer to jp 3-57 for more information.) civil affairs 6-130. civil affairs operations (cao) are those military operations planned, supported, or executed by ca forces to enhance cmo in support of unified land operations. the purpose of ca operations is to modify behaviors and mitigate or defeat threats to civil society. civil affairs tasks include population and resource control (prc), foreign humanitarian assistance (fha), civil information management (cim), nation assistance (na), and support to civil administration (sca). though these tasks are conducted throughout the range of unified land operations, they are fundamental to executing stability tasks. 6-131. at the tactical level, the primary focus of function of ca forces is to plan, assess, and enable local stabilization activities. stability tasks emphasize nonlethal, constructive actions by soldiers working between noncombatants. in operations focused on stability tasks, ca forces work with and through hn agencies and other civilian organizations to enhance the hn government’s legitimacy. often, ca teams work with company commanders and platoon s to coordinate civil military operations within the company’s ao. company leadership should coordinate with civil affairs units to ensure efforts are nested and mutually supporting. a framework for evaluating civil considerations is areas, structures, capabilities, organizations, people, and events (ascope). (refer to atp 2-01.3 for more information.) each consideration is described as follows: areas. determine the geographic variations in the area of responsibility, their potential military impact, and how they influence how people live. structures. describe the man-made structures in which the people live and work; determine those having cultural, religious, and economic significance. capabilities. determine the ability of various groups to influence the ao and the rest of the population relative to their possible intent to do so-determine economic and military potential given the areas and infrastructure. organizations. determine what informal and formal social, religious, familial, or political organizations exist and what their intent, purpose, and resources are. people. determine how the population aligns with organizations and one another; determine if they are likely to be supportive, detrimental, or neutral to the unit’s mission. events. create significant population event template and determine if future activity can be predicted based on pattern analysis. 6-132. while ca forces are organized, trained, and equipped specifically to support cmo, other enablers performing cmo include miso, sof, legal support, pa, engineer, transportation, hss, military police (mp), security forces, and maneuver units. civil affairs units 6-133. ca units establish, maintain, influence, or exploit relations between military forces and the indigenous populations and institutions where military forces are located. ca units conduct cao in coordination with civil authorities (both government and nongovernment) and the civil populace in a friendly, neutral, or hostile ao. this coordination facilitates military operations and consolidates civ il component operational objectives. ca units are designed for employment independently, attached opcon, or tactical control (tacon) to other forces. the most commonly encountered element from a ca organization is civil affairs team alpha (cat). the cat is structured to assess and provide recommendations on the immediate needs of the hn indigenous populations and institutions by executing cao in support of the commanders’ operations plan. at the platoon level, the typical relationship with the cats is one of providing security support during cao in high threat areas. chapter 6 6-24 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 capabilities 6-134. the ca company is organized to — provide a civil-military operations center (cmoc) with tactical-level planning, management, coordination, and synchronization of cao capability withi n the supported commander’s ao. provide communications capability that links directly into the supported unit’s communications architecture. provide cats in support of elements of the supported command capable of conducting civil reconnaissance (cr) and executing tactical level cao. facilitate integration of civil component input into the supported command’s cop. collate, analyze, and fuse civil information for input to the supported command’s cop. functions 6-135. the functions of the cat are to — conduct cr. engage key leaders by constantly vetting contacts to identify elites within the cat’s ao. plan, coordinate, and enable cao and project management. provide civil information and recommendations to the supported unit and cmoc for inclusion in the running estimates that support the civil component of the supported commander’s cop. employment 6-136. the cat can be deployed to — remain rapidly deployable. provide cao staff augmentation and ca planning and assessment support to tactical maneuver commanders. maintain direct data and voice communications with conventional, sof, indigenous population and institutions (ipi), intergovernmental organizations (igos), ngos, and interagency elements with classified and unclassified connectivity. support cmo conducted by military forces. conduct liaison with civilian authorities and key leaders. minimize interference between civil and military operations. conduct area studies and area assessments. assist the intelligence staff section (s-2) and other staff members with civil considerations analysis supporting preparation of the operational environment, as required. maintain the ability to operate independently in remote and austere environments. 6-137. ca forces coordinate with military and civilian agencies. ca forces have extensive capabilities in all forms of communications; thus, requiring little, if any, augmentation from the supported command. by table of organization and equipment (to&e), ca units are authorized the latest in conventional and special operations (so) communications equipment and computers. this allows them to send secured and unsecured internet communication, over-the-horizon (oth) radios, satellite-capable radios, and laptop computers with internet access. ca units need to be equipped with the current and most common civilian communications equipment to allow them to interface with igos, ngos, and ipi in the ao. specific requirements beyond these capabilities are determined during mission analysis and forwarded to the supported command as a statement of requirements (sor). augmenting combat power 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 6-25 limitations 6-138. the small size of ca elements may require a security force to conduct cao. this security is dependent upon theater and mission requirements. it is critical that sufficient security is available to provide protection and is coordinated with the cat conducting cao in support of the commander’s cmo plan. ca companies and cats do not have organic maintenance assets and require maintenance support from the unit they are attached to for operations. this page intentionally left blank. 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 7-1 chapter 7 enabling operations tactical enabling operations are specialized missions that units plan and conduct to achieve or sustain a tactical advantage. units execute these operations as part of offensive, defensive, or stability tasks. the fluid nature of oe increases the frequency with which the sbct infantry rifle company conducts these tactical operations. this chapter discusses assembly area operations, reconnaissance, security, patrols, relief in place, passage of lines, linkup operations, breaching operations, gap crossing and troop movement. section i – assembly area 7-1. an assembly area is an area a unit occupies to prepare for an operation (fm 3-90-1). ideally, an assembly area provides — concealment from air and ground observation. adequate entrances, exits, and internal routes. space for dispersion; each assembly area is separated by enough distance from other assembly areas to avoid mutual interference. cover from direct fire. good drainage and soil conditions that can sustain the movement of the unit vehicles and individual soldier. terrain masking of electromagnetic signatures. terrain allowing observation of ground and air avenues into the assembly area. sanctuary from enemy medium-range artillery fires because it is loca ted outside the enemy’s range. 7-2. the proper location of assembly areas contributes significantly to both security and flexibility. it should facilitate future operations so movement to subsequent positions can take place smoothly and quickly by concealed routes. the tactical mobility of the sbct infantry rifle company units allows it to occupy assembly areas at greater distances from the ld. quartering party employment 7-3. usually, the sbct infantry rifle company employs a quartering party (also known as an advan ce party) to assist in the occupation of an assembly area. a quartering party is a group of unit representatives dispatched to a probable new site of operations in advance of the main body to secure, reconnoiter, and organize an area prior to the main body ’s arrival and occupation ( fm 3-90-2). 7-4. the sbct infantry rifle company establishes the quartering party according to their sops. for example, the quartering party could consist of one vehicle from a platoon and a vehicle from the headquarters section. the sbct infantry rifle company xo, 1sg, or a senior nco usually leads the quartering party. the quartering party’s actions at the assembly area include the following: reconnoiter for enemy forces and cbrn contamination. evaluate the condition of the route leading into the assembly area and the suitability of the area (drainage, space, internal routes). organize the area based on the commander’s guidance; designate and mark tentative locations for platoons’ vehicles, command post vehicles, and trains. chapter 7 7-2 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 improve and mark entrances, exits, and internal routes. mark bypass es or removes obstacles (within the party’s capabilities). develop digital assembly area overlay and send overlays to sbct infantry rifle company main body and sbct infantry battalion main command post. occupation of the assembly area 7-5. once the quartering party finishes preparing the assembly area, the quartering party awaits the arrival of the sbct infantry rifle company main body, maintaining surveillance and providing security of the area within its capabilities. the main body is the principal part of a tactical command or formation. it does not include detached elements of the command, such as advance guards, flank guards, and covering forces. (fm 3-90-1). sops and guides assist vehicle commanders to quickly find their positions, clear the route, and assume designated positions in the assembly area. (see figure 7-1 on -3) 7-6. the sbct infantry rifle company may occupy the assembly area as an independent element or as part of the sbct infantry battalion. in either situation, the company occupies its positions upon arrival using the procedures for hasty occupation of a bp. the commander establishes local security and coordinates with adjacent units. he assigns weapons orientation and sector of fire for each platoon and subordinate element. if the sbct infantry rifle company occupies the assembly area alone, it establishes a perimeter defense. legend: aa = avenue of approach, cdr = commander, fist = fire integration support team, maint = maintenance, medevac = medical evacuation, mgs = mobile gun system, mtrs = mortars, xo = executive officer figure 7-1. sbct infantry rifle company assembly area enabling operations 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 7-3 actions in the assembly area 7-7. following occupation of the assembly area, the sbct infantry rifle company prepares for future operations by conducting tlps and priorities of work according to the sbct infantry battalion and the sbct infantry rifle company opords. these preparations include the following: establish and maintain security (at the appropriate readiness level). develop a defensive fire plan and forward it to the sbct infantry battalions main cp via bft/jcr, if equipped. employ sbct infantry rifle squads to conduct dismounted security patrols to clear dead space and restrictive terrain. conduct tlp. conduct precombat checks (pcc) and pci based on time available. perform maintenance on vehicles and communications equipment. verify weapons system status; conduct bore sighting, prepare-to -fire checks, test-firing, and other necessary preparations. note. the sbct infantry rifle company usually coordinates test firing with its higher headquarters. weapons control status conduct resupply, refueling and rearming operations. conduct rehearsals and other training for upcoming operations. conduct personal care and hygiene activities. adjust task organization as needed. account for sbct infantry rifle company personnel, to include attachments and sensitive items. reestablish vehicle load plans as needed. actions in the assembly area 7-8. following occupation of the assembly area, the sbct infantry rifle company prepares for future operations by conducting tlps and priorities of work according to the sbct infantry battalion and the sbct infantry rifle company opords. these preparations include the following: establish and maintain security (at the appropriate readiness level). develop a defensive fire plan and forward it to the sbct infantry battalions main cp via bft/jcr, if equipped. employ sbct infantry rifle squads to conduct dismounted security patrols to clear dead space and restrictive terrain. conduct tlp. conduct precombat checks (pcc) and precombat inspection (pci) based on time available. perform maintenance on vehicles and communications equipment. verify weapons system status; conduct bore sighting, prepare-to -fire checks, test-firing, and other necessary preparations. note. the sbct infantry rifle company usually coordinates test firing with its higher headquarters. weapons control status conduct resupply, refueling and rearming operations. conduct rehearsals and other training for upcoming operations. conduct personal care and hygiene activities. adjust task organization as needed. chapter 7 7-4 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016account for sbct infantry rifle company personnel, to include attachments and sensitive items. reestablish vehicle load plans as needed. section ii – reconnaissance 7-9. reconnaissance is a mission undertaken to obtain, by visual observation or other detection methods, information about the activities and resources of an enemy or adversary potential enemy, or to secure data concerning the meteorological, hydrographical, or geographical characteristics and the indigenous population of a particular area. reconnaissance primarily relies on the human dynamic rather than technical means. (refer to fm 3-90-2 for more information.) 7-10. reconnaissance identifies terrain characteristics, enemy and friendly obstacles to movement, and the disposition of enemy forces and civilian population so the platoon leader can maneuver his forces freely and rapidly. reconnaissance before unit movements and occupation of assembly areas is critical to protecting the force and preserving combat power. it keeps the force free from contact as long as possible so that it can concentrate on its decisive operation. 7-11. reconnaissance can be passive or active. passive reconnaissance includes such techniques as map and photographic reconnaissance and surveillance. active methods available to the sbct infantry rifle company include mounted and dismounted ground reconnaissance and reconnaissance by fire. active reconnaissance operations are classified as stealthy or aggressive. the sbct infantry rifle company conducts its reconnaissance operations in close contact with the enemy and civilians, and is capable to fight for information, consolidate gains, and maintain continuous reconnaissance. companies use all available assets in information collection to gain the most information to be analyzed. 7-12. human interactions, whomever they are with are crucial to information collection as well. once trust is built amongst the population and hnsf more information is likely to be obtained. it is important to not just rely on technology, but to interact one on one with the population and hnsf to build relationships and trust. reconnaissance fundamentals 7-13. the fundamentals of successful reconnaissance operations are as follows: ensure continuous reconnaissance. do not keep reconnaissance assets in reserve. orient on the reconnaissance objective. report information rapidly and accurately. retain freedom of maneuver. gain and maintain enemy contact. develop the situation rapidly. 7-14. effective reconnaissance is continuous. the sbct infantry rifle company conducts reconnaissance before, during, and after all operations. before an operation, reconnaissance focuses on filling gaps in intelligence about the enemy and terrain. during an operation, reconnaissance focuses on providing the commander with updated information that verifies the enemy’s composition, dispositions, an d intentions as the operation progresses. after an operation, reconnaissance focuses on maintaining contact with the enemy to determine his next move and collecting intelligence necessary for planning subsequent operations. 7-15. reconnaissance assets are never kept in reserve. when committed, reconnaissance assets use all of their resources to accomplish the mission. this does not mean that all assets are committed all the time. the commander uses his reconnaissance assets based on their capabilities and mission variables to achieve the maximum coverage needed to answer the ccirs. 7-16. the commander uses the reconnaissance objective to coordinate his unit’s reconnaissance efforts. the reconnaissance objective is a terrain feature, geographic area, or an enemy about which the commander wants to obtain additional information ( fm 3-90-1). enabling operations 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 7-5 7-17. reconnaissance assets acquire and report accurate and timely combat information about the enemy, civil considerations, and the terrain over which operations are to be conducted. combat information may quickly lose its value. reconnaissance assets report exactly what they see and, if appropriate, what they do not see. 7-18. reconnaissance assets retain mobility to successfully complete their missions. if these assets are decisively engaged, reconnaissance stops and a fight for survival begins. reconnaissance assets have clear engagement criteria that support the commander’s intent. they employ proper movement and reconnaissance techniques, use overwatching fires, and sops. 7-19. once a unit conducting reconnaissance gains contact with the enemy, it maintains that contact unless the commander directing the reconnaissance orders otherwise or the survival of the unit is at risk. this does not mean that individual scout and reconnaissance teams cannot break contact with the enemy. the commander of the unit conducting reconnaissance is responsible for maintaining contact using all available resources. 7-20. when a reconnaissance asset encounters an enemy force or an obstacle, it quickly determines the threat it faces. for an enemy force, it determines the enemy’s composition, dispositions, activities, and movements and assesses the implications of that combat information. for an obstacle, it determines the type and extent of the obstacle and whether it is covered by fire. obstacles can provide the attacker with combat information concerning the location of enemy forces, weapon capabilities, and organization of fires. forms of reconnaissa nce 7-21. the forms of reconnaissance operations are— zone. area. route. reconnaissance in force (rif). special (normally conducted by sof). zone reconnaissance 7-22. a zone reconnaissance is a directed effort to obtain detailed information concerning all routes, terrain, enemy forces, and obstacles to include areas of chemical and radiological contamination within a zone defined by specific boundaries (fm 3-90-2). companies do not usually conduct zone reconnaissance because of the troops to task requirements and timeliness of the information by the higher unit. zone reconnaissance is executed when the enemy situation is vague, or when information concerning crosscountry trafficability is required. (refer to adrp 3 -90 for more information.) the stryker infantry rifle company uses reconnaissance patrols as the primary method during conduct zone reconnaissance mission with consideration that enemy situation is not fully developed. the sbct infantry rifle company normally requires augmentation from engineers, cbrn reconnaissance platoon, human intelligence (humint) and civil affairs team to answer detailed information about the civilian population, bridges, infrastructure or cbrn hazard area. similar to route reconnaissance, mission variables and the commander’ s intent dictate the sbct infantry rifle c ompany’s actions during a zone reconnaissance. 7-23. zone reconnaissance tasks are as follows: find and report all enemy forces within the zone. clear all enemy forces in the designated ao within the capability of the unit conducting reconnaissance. determine the trafficability of all terrain within the zone, to include built-up areas. locate and determine the extent of all contaminated areas in the zone. evaluate and classify all bridges, defiles, overpasses, underpasses, and culverts in the zone. locate any fords, crossing sites, or bypasses, and reinforcing obstacles to include built-up areas in the zone. locate all obstacles and create lanes as specified in execution orders. chapter 7 7-6 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016report the above information to the commander directing the zone reconnaissance, to include providing a sketch map or overlay. area reconnaissance 7-24. area reconnaissance is a form of reconnaissance that focuses on obtained detailed information about the terrain or enemy activity within a prescribed area ( fm 3-90-2). the area can be any location that is critical to the unit’s operations. examples include easily identifiable areas covering a large space (suc h as towns or military installations), terrain features (ridgelines, wood lines, choke points), or a specific point (a bridge or a building). 7-25. additional assets for signal information , imagery intelligence (imint), humint, with a ll-source intelligence reside within the management information control office (mico) to assist in area reconnaissance. by accessing these assets would increase the ability to detect potential enemy threats or provide early warning. maintaining sa and requesting intelligence reports for specific areas in a routine or timely manner provide a better operational understanding before conducting area reconnaissance. the tasks of an area reconnaissance are the same as those for a zone reconnaissance and are conducted in the same manner. (see figure 7-2 .) legend: nai = named area of interest, obj = objective, pl = phase line figure 7-2. sbct infantry rifle company area reconnaissance route reconnaissance 7-26. route reconnaissance is a form of reconnaissance that focuses along a specific line o f communication, such as a road, railway, or cross-country mobility corridor ( fm 3-90-2). a route enabling operations 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 7-7 reconnaissance is a directed effort to obtain detailed information on a specific route and on all terrain from which the enemy can influence movement along that route. a route reconnaissance is usually conducted when the commander wants to use the route in question. trafficable routes are made easier to determine in an sbct because the stryker vehicles are made of the same chassis. consideration will include th e heavy expanded mobile tactical truck (hemtt) cargo is the largest and heaviest vehicle for logistics organic to the sbct. 7-27. route reconnaissance tasks are as follows: find, report, and clear all enemy elements that can influence movement along the route. determine the trafficability of the route; can it support the friendly force? reconnoiter all terrain that the enemy can use to dominate movement along the route, such as choke points, ambush sites, and pzs, lzs, and drop zones (dzs). reconnoiter all built-up areas, contaminated areas, and lateral routes along the route. evaluate and classify all bridges, defiles, overpasses and underpasses, and culverts along the route. locate any fords, crossing sites, or bypasses, and reinforcing obstacles to include built-up areas along the route. locate all obstacles, interdict and reduce ied/uxo and create lanes as specified in execution orders. report the above route intelligence to the headquarters initiating the route reconnaissance mission, to include providing a sketch map or a route overlay. 7-28. sbct infantry rifle company conducts route reconnaissance primarily with its infantry platoons augmented with engineers to support bridge classification. they use infantry to gather information along the route by deploying at specific points. these points are usually road intersections, bridges, culverts, hills, over passes, and under passes. (see figure 7-3 .) chapter 7 7-8 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 legend: cp = check point, ld = line of departure, loa = limit of advance, rp = rally point, sp = start point figure 7-3. route reconnaissance using fans reconnaissance in force 7-29. reconnaissance in force is a deliberate combat operation designed to discover or test the ene my’s strength, dispositions, and reactions or to obtain other information (adrp 3-90). battalion-sized task forces or larger organization usually conduct a reconnaissance in force mission. the sbct infantry rifle company will not conduct a reconnaissance in force independently, but may participate as part of a larger force. task organization 7-30. the sbct infantry rifle company can conduct route-, zone-, or area-reconnaissance. the sbct infantry rifle company may conduct a reconnaissance during preparation for another operation of its own (for example, performing area reconnaissance before initiating an attack); or it can conduct the reconnaissance to gain information for a higher headquarters. usually, the company is task-organized with engineer, humint, information collection assets, and uas platforms as needed to meet the requirements of the reconnaissance. enabling operations 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 7-9 planning considerations 7-31. reconnaissance planning starts with the commander identifying the ccir. this process may be conducted while the unit is planning or preparing for an operation; in many cases, it continues throughout the operation. the sbct infantry rifle company commander outlines the following: reconnaissance objective. enables subordinates to prioritize tasking and narrow their scope of operations. decision points. link dps to enemy actions. tempo. outlines the time requirements the commander envisions for the reconnaissance force and expresses them in order, outlines the degree of completeness, the degree of covertness, and the risk the commander is willing to accept. the commander knows that he accepts increased risk to both the reconnaissance element and the main body when he accelerates the pace of reconnaissance. this risk can be somewhat offset by employing air reconnaissance and technical means to cover open terrain or areas of lower threat. engagement criteria. establishes the size or type of enemy forces the commander expects his reconnaissance force to engage, and at the expected level of force. this helps leaders to plan direct and indirect fires, and establish bypass criteria. 7-32. the commander considers mett-tc as he plans for mounted, dismounted, aircraft, or combinations of these methods of reconnaissance. conditions that can result in a decision to conduct mounted, dismounted, or aircraft reconnaissance include the following: time constraints. required detail level of reconnaissance. availability of air units to perform coordinated reconnaissance with ground assets. ipb. avenues of approach that support friendly movement and exploit enemy weaknesses. key positions, especially flanks that can be exploited. ops. type of terrain. environmental conditions, such as deep snow and muddy terrain that greatly hinder mounted reconnaissance. 7-33. the commander considers employing uass for ground reconnaissance. uass provide the commander with essential terrain and enemy information. most uass can operate in daylight or limited visibility, and are difficult to detect or shoot down. (refer to fm 3-04.155 for more information.) 7-34. leaders at all echelons coordinate and synchronize reconnaissance efforts. the commander selects formation changes dependent on enemy and terrain. leaders control the movement of the forces changing between traveling, traveling overwatch and bounding overwatch as they approach the probable line of contact and the reconnaissance objective. the key point is to use reconnaissance assets based on their capabilities, and use their complementary capabilities to verify and expand on available intelligence. 7-35. sustainment planning is indispensable throughout the planning process. the commander assesses all constraints and considers the following: resupply procedures for both mounted and dismounted reconnaissance missions. predetermined locations and times for resupply of classes i, iii, iv, v, vii, and ix. resupply considerations for class viii. reviews ttps for casualty extraction and medevac. pickup points and times for pickup and aerial extraction of casualties. review ttps for vehicle recovery procedures. fire support 7-36. the commander asks the following questions as he prepares his fire support plan: where are the enemy target acquisition assets (such as radar)? chapter 7 7-10 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016where will the enemy deploy his artillery? this intelligence helps plan direct and indirect counter fires. what are the hvt? what are the hpt that were developed during the war-gaming or targeting processes? what is the range of the enemy’s indirect fires? this intelligence helps plan direct and indirect fires, and establishes bypass criteria. section iii – security 7-37. security operations are those operations undertaken by the commander to provide early and accurate warning of enemy operations, to provide the force being protected with time and maneuver space within which to react to the enemy, and to develop the situation to allow the commander to effectively use the protected force (adrp 3-90). security operations enable the commander to detect enemy operations, protect another unit, and develop the situation. security operations include reconnaissance aimed at reducing terrain and enemy unknowns; gaining and maintaining contact with the enemy to ensure continuous information collection; and providing early and accurate reporting of combat information to the protected force. security forces orient in any direction from a stationary or moving force. fundamentals of security operations 7-38. the five fundamentals of security operations are — provide early and accurate warning. provide reaction time and maneuver space. orient on the force, area, or facility to be protected. perform continuous reconnaissance. maintain enemy contact. provide early and accurate warning 7-39. the security force provides early and accurate warning by detecting the threat force quickly an d reporting combat information accurately to the commander. early warning of threat activity provides the commander with the time, space, and intelligence he needs to retain the tactical initiative and to choose the time and place to concentrate against the threat. placement of communication specifically retransmission (retrans) stations is vital to establishing long-range communication with higher and adjacent units. at a minimum, the security force should operate far enough from the main body to prevent enemy ground forces from observing or engaging the main body with direct fire. positions maneuver forces, sensors, and tactical uass to provide long –range observation of expected threat avenues of approach. long-range observation can be enhanced by the use of stryker vehicle optics particularly with the mgs thermal images. 7-40. in stability tasks, providing early and accurate warning is much harder to achieve. in many cases, threat personnel in the ao are indistinguishable from civilian noncombatants. they might elude positive identification as a threat until their actions reveal them as such. this fundamental may be expressed in the stability environment in the following ways: identification of and regular communication with key civil and religious leaders. continuous surveillance of known or suspected enemy meeting locations. proactive, friendly engagement with the indigenous population to ascertain threat developments in their community that may otherwise be transparent to the unit. provide reaction time and maneuver space 7-41. the security force operates as far from the protected force as possible within supporting range of the protected force, consistent with mett-tc. more distance usually yields greater reaction time and maneuver space for the protected force commander, provided communications are maintained. the security force fights as needed to gain and retain adequate time and space for the protected force commander, allowing him to maneuver and concentrate forces to counter the threat. enabling operations 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 7-11 orient on the force , area, or f acility to be protected 7-42. the security force focuses all its actions on protecting the secured force or facility and providing maximum early warning of threat activity. it operates between the main body and known or suspected enemy units. the security force moves as the main body moves and orients on its movement. the security force commander has to know the main body’s scheme of maneuver and maneuver his force so it remains between the main body and the enemy. the value of terrain occupied by the security force depends on the operational area security it provides to the main body commander. 7-43. in stability tasks, the security force should orient on the routes or areas where enemy activities frequently occur. they could reemphasize on locations where ieds or other explosive hazards have been repeatedly used. another example is the security force orienting surveillance on the offices occupied by a newly seated foreign government whose legitimacy may be contested and targeted for violence by threat factions. perform continuous reconnaissance 7-44. security comes in large part from knowing as much as possible about the threat and terrain within the assigned ao. this detailed knowledge results from ongoing, focused reconnaissance that aggressively and continuously reconnoiters key terrain; seeks the location, composition, and disposition of the threat; and attempts to determine the threat’s coa early so that the sbct infantry rifle company can counter it. stationary security forces use combinations of ops, patrols, and other information collection assets to perform continuous reconnaissance. moving security forces accomplish this fundamental by performing area-, zone-, or route-reconnaissance in conjunction with temporary ops and bps. 7-45. in stability tasks, units conduct continuous information collection with patrols, uas, checkpoints, sensors, and urban ops that keep a specific location under observation for extended periods. snipers are an organic asset within the sbct infantry rifle company that can assist with covert observation of an urban op. reconnaissance may be linked to specific route security operations. maintain enemy contact 7-46. once gained, contact is not broken unless otherwise directed. the individual or sensor that first makes contact does not have to maintain it. however, the security force, collectively, maintains contact. the security force continuously conducts information collection on the threat’s activities, and prevents the threat from surprising the main body or endangering adjacent friendly forces. 7-47. the fundamentals of maintaining enemy contact require the following: continuous contact (visual, electronic, sensor, or a combination). capability to use direct and indirect fires. freedom to maneuver. depth (of observers in time and space). forms of security 7-48. leaders categorize security operations in terms of the degree of security provided and the amount of combat power required. (refer to adrp 3-90 for more information.) there are five primary forms of security operations : screen is a security task that primarily provides early warning to the protected forces. guard is a security task whose primary task is to protect the main body by fighting to gain time while also observing and reporting combat information and preventing enemy ground observation of and direct fire against the main body. units conducting a guard mission cannot operate independently because they rely upon fires and close combat forces assets of the main body. cover is a security task to protect the main body by fighting to gain time while also observing and reporting intelligence and preventing enemy ground observation of and direct fire against the main body. unlike a screening or guard force, the covering force is a self-contained force capable of operating independently of the main body. chapter 7 7-12 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016area security is a security task conducted to protect friendly forces, installations, routes, and actions within a specific area. local security is a security task that includes close in security activities conducted near a unit to prevent surprise by the enemy. 7-49. the sbct infantry rifle company can conduct screen and guard independently without external augmentation. the company participates in covering force operations only as part of a larger element. it can conduct area security missions on its own, but will usually participate as part of a sbct infantr y battalion area security force such as an advance guard. the company always provides its own local security. local security includes observation posts, local security patrols, perimeter security, and other measures taken to provide close-in security. 7-50. the screen, guard, and cover, respectively, contain increasing levels of combat power and provide increasing levels of security for the main body. however, more combat power in the security force means less for the main body. area security preserves the comman der’s freedom of move his reserves, position fire support means, provide for mission command, and conduct sustaining operations. local security provides immediate security for his forces. screen 7-51. a screen primarily provides early warning by observing, identifying, and reporting enemy actions. it provides the least amount of security of any security mission. generally, a screening force engages and destroys enemy reconnaissance elements within its capabilities, but otherwise fights to not be decisively engaged or fixed. the sbct infantry rifle company can conduct a screen mission independently or as part of an sbct infantry battalion or brigade operation. it maximizes its use of infantry conducting combat, reconnaissance and security patrols. the mgs in combination with the infantry platoons and mortar section support should be used to conduct combat patrols, or assist with elements in contact to break contact. depending on mission variables, the sbct infantry rifle company might require augmentation to conduct an effective screen mission. acquiring stryker reconnaissance vehicle (rv) equipped with long range acquiring scout surveillance system (lras3) can increase the ability to identify enemy elements. 7-52. a screen is appropriate to cover gaps between forces, the exposed flanks or rear of stationary and moving forces, or the front of a stationary formation. units use screens when the likelihood of enemy contact is remote, the expected enemy force is small, or the friendly main body needs only a minimum amount of time, once it is warned, to react effectively. a screening force primarily uses indirect fires or cas to destroy enemy reconnaissance elements and slow the movement of other enemy forces. units usually accomplish screening by establishing a series of ops and conducting patrols to ensure adequate surveillance of the assigned ao. 7-53. screen tasks are to — allow no enemy ground element to pass through the screen undetected and unreported. maintain continuous surveillance of all avenues of approach into the designated area under all visibility conditions. destroy or repel all enemy reconnaissance within its capabilities. locate the lead elements of each enemy advance guard and determine its direction of movement in a defensive screen. maintain contact with enemy forces and report any activity in the ao. maintain contact with the main body and any security forces operating on its flanks. impede and harass the enemy within its capabilities while displacing. 7-54. counterreconnaissance is an essential component of security operations. the security force should deny the enemy information and intelligence concerning the friendly force. the security force accomplishes this by destroying, defeating, or deceiving enemy reconnaissance units or sensors according to engagement criteria and the roe. enabling operations 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 7-13 guard 7-55. a guard differs from a screen in that a guard force contains sufficient combat power to defeat, cause the withdrawal of, or fix the lead elements of an enemy ground force before it can engage the main body with direct fire. a guard force routinely engages enemy forces with direct and indirect fires while a screening force primarily uses indirect fires or cas to destroy enemy reconnaissance elements and slow the movement of other enemy forces. a guard force uses all means at its disposal, to include decisive engagement, to prevent the enemy from penetrating to a position where it could observe and engage the main body. it operates within the range of the main body’s fire support weapons, deploying over a narrower front than a comparable-size screening force to permit concentrating combat power. the sbct infantry rifle company can conduct a guard mission independently. 7-56. the three types of guard operations are as follows : advance, flank, and rear guard. the commander can assign a guard mission to protect either a stationary or a moving force. the advance guard is responsible for clearing the axis of advance or designated portions of the ao of enemy elements. this allows the main body to move unimpeded, prevents the unnecessary delay of the main body, and defers the deployment of the main body for as long as possible. an advance guard for a stationary force is defensive in nature. the rifle company uses its stryker infantry platoon to fix an enemy force while another force that can be tasked organized with stryker infantry or mgs maneuver out of contact to engage the enemy force. it defends or delays according to the main body commander’s intent. an a dvance guard for a moving stryker force is offensive in nature and normally conducts a movement to contact and tries to initiate contact with dismounted elements. a flank guard protects against an exposed flank of the main body. the commander of the main body designates the general location of the flank guard’s positions. aos assigned to the flank guard should be sufficiently deep to provide early warning and reaction time. however, flank guards remain within supporting range of the main body. the stryker infantry rifle company conducts this by using alternating bounds with infantry dismounting at key points along likely enemy avenues of approach. the rear guard protects the exposed rear of the main body. this occurs during offensive tasks when the main body breaks contact with flanking forces or during a retrograde. the commander may deploy a rear guard behind both moving and stationary main bodies. the rear guard for a moving force displaces to successive bps along pls or delay lines in depth as the main body moves. the nature of enemy contact determines the exact movement method or combination of methods used in the displacement (successive bounds, alternate bounds, and continuous marching). 7-57. a unit conducting a guard performs certain tasks within its capabilities unless ordered otherwise. if a unit does not have the time or other resources to complete all of these tasks, it informs the commander assigning the mission of the shortfall and requests guidance on which tasks to complete or the priority of tasks. after starting the guard, if the unit determines that it cannot complete an assigned task, such as cause deployment of the enemy advance guard, it reports this to the commander and awaits further instructions. cover 7-58. the sbct infantry rifle company is not structured to conducting a cover on its own. a covering force is a self-contained force capable of operating independently of the main body, unlike a screening or guard force to conduct the cover task ( fm 3-90 -1) . a covering force, or portions of it, often becomes decisively engaged with enemy forces. therefore, the covering force has to have substantial combat power to engage the enemy and accomplish its mission. a covering force develops the situation earlier than a screen or a guard force. it fights longer and more often and defeats larger enemy forces. 7-59. while a covering force provides more security than a screen or guard force, it requires more resources. a covering force accomplishes all the tasks of screening and guard forces. a covering force for a stationary force performs a defensive mission, while a covering force for a moving force generally conducts offensive actions. a covering force normally operates forward of the main body in the offense or defense, or to the rear for a retrograde. chapter 7 7-14 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 area security 7-60. area security operations may be offensive or defensive in nature. they focus on the protected force, installation, route, or area. forces to protect range from echelon headquarters through artillery and echelon reserves to the sustaining base. protected installations can be part of the sustaining base or they can constitute part of the area’s infrastructure. areas to secure range from specific points (bridges and defiles) and terrain features (ridge lines and hills) to large population centers and their adjacent areas. the sbct infantry rifle company can conduct an area security operation independently or as part of a sbct infantry battalion operation. 7-61. area security operations can require the execution of a wide variety of supporting operations and tasks. depending on mission variables, a sbct infantry rifle company might require augmentation to conduct area security effectively. 7-62. when conducting an area security mission, the sbct infantry rifle company prevents threat ground reconnaissance elements from directly observing friendly activities within the area being secured. it prevents threat ground maneuver forces from penetrating the defensive perimeters established by the commander. the commander may direct his subordinate platoons to employ a variety of techniques (such as ops, bps, ambushes, sniper employment and combat outposts) to accomplish this security mission. a reserve or qrf enables the commander to react to unforeseen contingencies. using the assigned uas and the information collection assets available to the sbct infantry battalion, the sbct infantry rifle company can execute security tasks through ambushes and preemptive strikes proactively and with greater precision. 7-63. an analysis of mission variables enables the commander to determine the augmentation for the sbct rifle company, with particular consideration given to the need for aviation, engineers, and artillery. early warning of threat activity is paramount when conducting area security missions, and provides the commander with time and space to react to threats. proper intelligence analysis and information collection planning, coupled with dismounted/mounted patrols and aerial reconnaissance, is essential to successful operations, especially when securing fixed sites. failure to conduct continuous reconnaissance can create a vulnerable seam through which the enemy can execute an infiltration or attack. 7-64. during area security operations civilians will be present. therefore, leaders ensure soldiers understand current roe. however, leaders are always responsible for protecting their forces and consider this responsibility when applying the roe. restrictions on conducting operations and using force need to be explained clearly and understood by everyone. soldiers need to understand their actions, no matter how minor, may have far-reaching positive or negative effects. they need to realize both friendly or hostile media and adversary information activities can quickly exploit their actions, especially the manner in which they treat the civilian population. 7-65. when a perimeter is not feasible, the sbct infantry rifle company secures the area by establishing a presence and conducting operations throughout the area. the sbct infantry rifle company establishes perimeters around base camps, critical infrastructure, and high-value assets, while other units conduct operations to establish presence, provide security, and conduct stability tasks. the company can position a reaction force between several secured perimeters. other missions or tasks in support of area security may include the following: screens along zones of separation or other designated areas. route or convoy security of critical lines of communication. checkpoints to monitor or control movement. biometric data collection. demonstrations to maintain an observable presence. local security 7-66. local security includes any local measure(s) taken by units to prevent surprise by the enemy. it involves avoiding detection by the enemy or deceiving the enemy about friendly positions and intentions. local security is an important part of maintaining the initiative. the requirement for maintaining local security is an inherent part of all operations. units use both active and passive measures to provide local security. active measures include ops, patrols, and conducting stand-to. passive measures include enabling operations 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 7-15 camouflage, noise and light discipline, and sensors to maintain surveillance over the area immediately around the unit. 7-67. the sbct infantry rifle company is responsible for maintaining its own security at all times. each stryker vehicle should have a dismounted element for local security. stryker vehicles are vulnerable from attacks on its rear and sides from dismounts. platoons and sections should establish mutually supporting positions for stryker vehicles and their dismounted elements for 360 degree local security and to allow a smaller local security force and a larger dismounted forward element. in addition to maintaining security for its own elements, the sbct infantry rifle company may implement local security for other units as directed by the sbct infantry battalion commander. examples of such situations include, but are not limited to, the following: provide security for engineers as they emplace/clear obstacles or construct survivability positions in the sbct infantry rifle company bp. secure an lz. establish mounted or dismounted ops to maintain surveillance of enemy infiltration and reconnaissance routes. conduct patrols to cover gaps in observation and to clear possible enemy op from surrounding areas. humint. ngos. supply and logistical operations. section iv – patrols 7-68. a patrol is a detachment sent out by a larger unit to conduct a combat, reconnaissance, or security mission. a patrol’s organization is temporary and specifically matched to the immediate tas k. because a patrol is an organization, not a mission, it is not correct to speak of giving a unit a mission to “ patrol .” (refer to attp 3-21.9 for additional information about patrols.) 7-69. a patrol can consist of a unit as small as a fire team. squad- and platoon-size patrols are normal. if a patrol is made up of a single unit, such as a sbct infantry rifle squad sent out on a reconnaissance patrol, the squad leader is responsible. if a patrol is made up of mixed elements from several units, then the senior officer or nco is designated as the patrol leader. this temporary title defines his role and responsibilities for that mission. the patrol leader may designate an assistant, normally the next senior man in the patrol, and any subordinate element leaders he requires. 7-70. the planned action determines the type of patrol. the two types of patrols are combat and reconnaissance. regardless of the type of patrol, the unit needs a clear task and purpose. the leader of any patrol, regardless of the type or the tactical task assigned, has an inherent responsibility to prepare and plan for possible enemy contact while on the mission. patrols are never administrative as they are always assigned a tactical mission. (refer to fm 3-21.8 for more information.) combat patrol 7-71. a combat patrol provides security and harasses, destroys, or captures enemy troops, equipment, or installations. when the commander gives a unit the mission to send out a combat patrol, he intends for the patrol to make contact with the enemy and engage in close combat. a combat patrol always tries to avoid detection while moving, but discloses their location to the enemy in a sudden, violent attack. for this reason, the patrol normally carries a significant amount of weapons and ammunition. it may carry specialized munitions. a combat patrol collects and reports any combat information gathered during the mission, whether related to the combat task or not. the three types of combat patrols are as follows: raid. ambush. security. 7-72. stryker infantry conduct combat patrols tasked organized based on the mission variables of mett-tc. they possess the capability to engage in close combat with infantry and conduct sudden and chapter 7 7-16 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016violent attacks with significant firepower in combined arms with the use of crew served weapons from the mgs, icv, mcv stryker vehicles, or infantry weapons squads. reconnaissance patrol 7-73. a reconnaissance patrol collects combat information or confirms or disproves the accuracy of intelligence previously gained. the intent for this type of patrol is to avoid enemy contact and accomplish its tactical task without engaging in close combat. reconnaissance patrols always try to accomplish their mission without being detected or observed. because detection cannot always be avoided, a reconnaissance patrol carries the necessary arms and equipment to protect itself and break contact with the enemy. a reconnaissance patrol with as few personnel, arms, and equipment as only necessary. this increases stealth and cross-country mobility in close terrain. regardless of how the patrol is armed and equipped, the leader always plans for the worst case: contact. the three types of reconnaissance patrols infantry units conduct are as follows: route. area. zone. 7-74. the stryker infantry rifle c ompany task-organizes its reconnaissance patrols. it will always comprise itself of infantry that deploy prior to points of suspected contact to ensure that it avoids enemy initiated contact. section v – relief in place 7-75. a rip is an operation in which, by the direction of higher authority, all or part of a unit is replaced in an area by the incoming unit. the responsibilities of the replaced elements for the mission and the assigned ao are transferred to the incoming unit. the incoming unit continues the operations as ordered (fm 3-90-1). the commander conducts a rip as part of a larger operation, primarily to maintain the combat effectiveness of committed units. the higher headquarters directs when and where to conduct the relief and establishes the appropriate control measures. normally, the unit relieved is defending. however, a relief may set the stage for resuming offensive tasks. a relief may serve to free the relieved unit for other tasks (such as decontamination, reconstitution, routine rest, resupply, maintenance, or specialized training). sometimes, as part of a larger operation, the commander wants the enemy force to discover the relief, because that discovery might cause it to do something in response that is prejudicial to its interest, such as move reserves from an area where the friendly commander wants to conduct a penetration. 7-76. there are three techniques for conducting a relief —sequentially, simultaneously, or staggered. a sequential relief occurs when each element within the relieved unit is relieved in succession, from right to left or left to right, depending on how it is deployed. a simultaneous relief occurs when all elements are relieved at the same time. a staggered relief occurs when the commander relieves each element in a sequence determined by the tactical situation, not its geographical orientation. simultaneous relief takes the least time to execute, but is more easily detected by the enemy. sequential or staggered reliefs can take place over a significant amount of time. these three relief techniques can occur regardless of the range of military operations (romo) in which the unit is participating. 7-77. a relief can be characterized as either deliberate or hasty, depending on the amount of planning and preparations associated with the relief. the major differences are the depth and detail of planning and, potentially, the execution time. detailed planning generally facilitates shorter execution time by determining exactly what the commander believes needs to be done and the resources needed to accomplish the mission. deliberate planning allows the commander and staff to identify, develop, and coordinate solutions to most potential problems before they occur and to ensure the availability of resources when and where they are needed. planning 7-78. once ordered to conduct a rip, the commander of the relieving unit contacts the commander of the unit to be relieved. the collocation of unit cps helps achieve the level of coordination required. if the enabling operations 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 7-17 relieved unit’s forward elements can defend the ao, the relieving unit executes the rip from the rear to the front. this facilitates movement and terrain management. 7-79. when planning for a rip, the sbct infantry rifle company commander takes the following actions: issue an order immediately. send an advance party composed of key leaders to conduct detailed reconnaissance and coordination. as the relieving unit, adopt the outgoing unit’s normal pattern of activity a s much as possible. as the relieving unit, determine when the sbct infantry rifle company will assume responsibility for the outgoing unit’s position. as the relieving unit, colocate company headquarters with the relieved unit’s headquarters. maximize operations security to prevent the enemy from detecting the relief operation. note. whenever possible, conduct the relief at night or under other limited visibility conditions. plan for relief of sustainment elements after combat elements are relieved. as the unit being relieved, plan for transfer of excess ammunition, wire, petroleum, oil, and lubricants, and other material of tactical value to the incoming unit. control movement by reconnoitering, designating, and marking routes, and providing guides. coordination 7-80. the incoming and outgoing commanders meet to exchange tactical intelligence, conduct a joint reconnaissance of the area, and complete other required coordination. the two commanders carefully address passage of command and jointly develop contingency actions to deal with enemy contact during the relief. this process usually includes coordination of the following information: location of vehicle and individual fighting positions (to include hide, alternate, and supplementary positions). leaders should verify fighting positions both by conventional map and on bft/jcr (if equipped). the enemy

indirect fire plans and the time of relief for supporting artillery and mortar units. types of weapons systems being replaced. time, sequence, and method of relief. location and disposition of obstacles, and the time when the commanders will transfer responsibility. supplies and equipment to be transferred. movement control, route priority, and placement of guides. command and signal information. note. units conduct relief on the radio nets of the outgoing unit. maintenance and logistical support for disabled vehicles. visibility considerations. capability gaps and recommendations to fill gaps if the stryker infantry rifle company is conducting relief with another non-stryker organization. conducting the relief 7-81. when conducting the relief, the outgoing commander retains responsibility for the ao and the mission. he exercises operational control over all subordinate elements of the incoming unit that have chapter 7 7-18 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016completed their portion of the relief. responsibility passes to the incoming commander when all elements of the outgoing unit are relieved and adequate communications are established. staggered relief 7-82. a staggered relief occurs when the commander relieves each element in a sequence determined by the tactical situation, not its geographical orientation and usually in situations where the commander desires to conceal the relief from the enemy (fm 3-90-1). the staggered relief often follows the sequence of the sequential relie f. sequential relief 7-83. sequential relief is the most time-consuming relief method. the relieving unit moves to an assembly area to the rear of the unit to be relieved. subordinate elements are relieved one at a time. this can occur in any order, with the relief following this general sequence: the outgoing and incoming units colocate their headquarters and trains elements to facilitate mission command and transfer of equipment, ammunition, fuel, water, and medical supplies. the first element being relieved (such as a platoon) moves to its alternate fighting positions or battle positions while the relieving element moves into the outgoing element’s primary fighting positions. the incoming element occupies vehicle and individual fighting positions as appropriate. incoming and outgoing elements complete the transfer of equipment and supplies. the relieved element moves to the designated assembly area behind its position. once each outgoing element clears the rally point en route to its assembly area, the next relieving element moves forward. simultaneous relief 7-84. simultaneous relief is the fastest, but least secure, method. all outgoing elements are relieved at once, with the incoming unit usually occupying positions, to include battle positions, and vehicle and individual fighting positions. the relief takes place in this general sequence: outgoing elements move to their alternate bps or vehicle and individual positions. incoming elements move along designated routes to the outgoing elements’ primary fighting positions. the units complete the transfer of equipment and supplies. relieved elements move to the designated unit assembly area. section vi – passage of lines 7-85. passage of lines is an operation in which a force moves forward or rearward through another unit’s positions with the intent of moving into or out of contact with the enemy. a passage may be designated as a forward or rearward passage of lines (jp 1-02). units usually conduct passage of lines when at least one mett-tc factor does not permit the bypass of a friendly unit. a passage of lines is a complex operation requiring close supervision and detailed planning, coordination, and synchronization between the battalion commanders of the unit conducting the passage and the unit being passed. the primary purpose of a passage of lines is to transfer responsibility (forward or rearward) for an area from one unit to another. 7-86. a passage of lines occurs under two basic conditions. a forward passage of lines occurs when a unit passes through another unit’s positions while moving toward the enemy. a rearward passage of lines occurs when a unit passes through another unit’s positions while moving away from the enemy ( fm 3-901). planning considerations 7-87. the controlling sbct infantry battalion is responsible for planning and coordinating a passage of lines involving the sbct infantry rifle company. in some situations, such as the sbct infantry rifle enabling operations 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 7-19 company using multiple passage routes (that is, a separate route for each platoon), the company commander takes responsibility for planning and coordinating each phase of the operation. 7-88. when planning a passage of lines, the commander considers the following tactical factors and procedures: passage lanes, use of deception, battle handover, obstacles, air defense, sustainment responsibilities, mission control, reconnaissance and coordination, forward passage of lines, and rearward passage of lines. forward passage of lines 7-89. in a forward passage, the passing unit first moves to an assembly area or an attack position behind the stationary unit. designated liaison personnel move forward to link up with guides and confirm coordination information with the stationary unit. guides then lead the passing elements through the passage lane. (see figure 7 -4.) 7-90. the sbct infantry rifle company conducts a forward passage by employing tactical movement. it moves quickly, using appropriate dispersal and formations whenever possible, and using its digital communication systems to make initial contact. it bypasses disabled vehicles, as needed. the company holds its fire until it passes the bhl or the designated fire control measure, unless the commander has coordinated fire control with the stationary unit. once clear of passage lane restrictions, the unit consolidates at a rally point or attack position, and then conducts tactical movement according to its orders. chapter 7 7-20 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 legend: bhl = battle handover line, ld = line of departure, mgs = mobile gun system, pl = phase line, rp = rally point, sp = start point figu re 7-4. sbct infantry rifle company forward passage of line rearward passage of lines 7-91. because of the increased chance of fratricide and friendly fire during a rearward passage, coordination of recognition signals and direct fire restrictions is critical. (see figure 7-5 on -21.) rehearsals and training can help reduce fratricide and friendly fire. the passing unit contacts the stationary unit while it is still beyond direct fire range and conducts coordination as discussed previously. near recognition signals and location of the bhl are emphasized. both the passing unit and the stationary unit can employ additional fire control measures, such as restrictive fire lines (rfl), to minimize the risk of fratricide and friendly fire. enabling operations 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 7-21 legend: cdr = commander, fist = fire integration support team, rp = rally point, sp = start point, xo = executive officer figure 7-5. sbct infantry rifle company rearward passage of lines 7-92. following coordination, the passing unit continues tactical movement toward the passage lane. the passing unit is responsible for its security until it passes the bhl. if the stationary unit provides guides, the passing unit can conduct a short halt to link up and coordinate with them. the passing unit moves quickly through the passage lane to a designated location behind the stationary unit. 7-93. stationary unit and passing unit responsibilities. (see table 7-1.) chapter 7 7-22 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 table 7-1. stationary and passing unit responsibilities stationary unit passing unit clears lanes or reduces obstacles along routes . may assist with reducing obstacles provides obstacle and friendly units’ locations. provides order of movement and scheme of maneuver. clears and maintains routes up to the bho line. may assist with

line. maintains protection measures. identifies locations for the passing unit to use as assembly areas and attack positions. assumes full responsibility for its own sustainment support forward of the bho line. controls all fires in support of the passage. positions artillery to support the passage. section vii – linkup 7-94. a linkup is a meeting of friendly ground forces, which occurs in a variety of circumstances (fm 3-90-1). it happens when an advancing force reaches an objective area previously seized by another force, when an encircled force breaks out to rejoin friendly forces, or when a force comes to the relief of an encircled force, and when converging maneuver forces meet. both forces may be moving toward each other, or one may be stationary. whenever possible, joining forces exchange as much information as possible before starting a mission. 7-95. the headquarters ordering the linkup establishes — a common operational picture. command relationship and responsibilities of each force before, during, and after linkup. coordination of fire support before, during, and after linkup, to include control measures. linkup method. recognition signals and communication procedures to use, to include pyrotechnics, armbands, vehicle markings, weapon orientation, panels, colored smoke, lights, and challenge and passwords. actions to conduct following linkup. control measures 7-96. the commander who orders the linkup establishes control measures for units conducting the linkup. he assigns each unit an ao defined by left and right boundaries and a restricted fire line. he establishes a no-fire area around one or both companies to ensure that uncleared air-delivered munitions or indirect fires do not cross either the rfl or a boundary and impact friendly forces. 7-97. the restricted fire line assists with the prevention of fratricide. the linkup forces use the linkup points established by the commander to make physical contact with each other. the commander designates alternate linkup points, since enemy action may interfere with the primary linkup points. control measures are adjusted during the mission to provide for freedom of action and positive control. execution 7-98. there are two linkup techniques. the preferred method is when the moving force has an assigned loa near the other force and conducts the linkup at predetermined contact points. units then coordinate further actions. enabling operations 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 7-23 7-99. the least preferred method of linkup a commander can use during highly mobile or fluid operations is when the enemy force escapes from a potential encirclement or when one of the linkup forces is at risk and requires immediate reinforcement. in this method, the moving force continues to move and conduct long-range recognition via radio or other measures, stopping only when it makes physical contact with the other force. phases of the linkup 7-100. the sbct infantry rifle company conducts linkup activities independently or as part of a larger force. within a larger unit, the company may lead the linkup force. the linkup consists of three phases. the following actions are critical to the execution of a successful linkup. phase 1, far recognition signal 7-101. during this phase, the forces conducting a linkup establish both fm radio and digital communications before reaching direct fire range. the lead element of each linkup force should monitor the radio frequency of the other friendly force and its digital communications for messages. phase 2, coordination 7-102. before initiating movement to the linkup point, the forces coordinate necessary tactical information/intelligence that includes the following: known enemy situation. bft/jcr (if equipped) filter setting and address book commonality. type and number of friendly vehicles and number of vehicles equipped with bft/jcr. disposition of stationary forces (if either unit is stationary). routes to the linkup point and rally point (if any). direct and indirect fire control measures. near recognition signal(s). communications information. sustainment responsibilities and procedures. finalized location of the linkup point and rally point(s) (if any). any special coordination, such as those covering maneuver instructions or requests for medical support. phase 3, movement to the linkup point and linkup 7-103. all units or elements involved in the linkup enforce strict fire control measures to help prevent fratricide and friendly fire. moving or converging forces must easily recognize linkup points and rfl. linkup elements take the following actions: conduct far recognition using fm radio or bft/jcr (if equipped). conduct short-range (near) recognition using the designated signal. complete movement to the linkup point. establish local security at the linkup point. conduct additional coordination and linkup activities, as needed. section viii – breaching 7-104. breaching is a synchronized combined arms operation under the control of the maneuver commander. whenever possible, units should bypass obstacles, enabling it to maintain the momentum of the operation. commanders ensure that conducting the bypass provides a tactical advantage without exposing the unit to unnecessary danger. breaching begins when friendly forces detect an obstacle. breaching ends when friendly forces destroy the enemy on the far side of the obstacle, or when battle handover has occurred between a unit conducting the breaching and follow-on forces. successful obstacle breaching depends on the sbct infantry rifle company effectively applying the breaching fundamentals of chapter 7 7-24 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016sosra. deliberate, hasty (includes in-stride), and covert are the three general types of breaching operations. (refer to atp 3-34.22 for more information.) breaching tenets 7-105. successful breaching is characterized by applying breaching tenets. these tenets should be applied whenever an obstacle is encountered in the ao, whether during an attack or a route clearance. the tenet s are— intelligence. breaching fundamentals. breaching organization. mass. synchronization. intelligence 7-106. success depends largely on the force commander’s ability to see the ao. he identif ies how the enemy is using the terrain to minimize the risk of surprise. this is particularly true when attempting to counter the enemy’s use of obstacles. this is done with the ipb process. during the ipb process, the situation template is developed. the situational template is a graphic al depiction of expected threat dispositions based on threat doctrine and the effects of the ao for a particular coa. (refer to atp 2-01.3 for more information.) breaching fundamentals 7-107. sosra are the breaching fundamentals that are applied to ensure success when breaching against a defending enemy. these fundamentals always apply, but they may vary based on the mission variables. (see table 7-2 on -26.) 7-108. suppression is a tactical task used to employ direct or indirect fires or an electronic attack on enemy personnel, weapons, or equipment to prevent or degrade enemy fires and observation of friendly forces (atp 3-34.22). the purpose of suppression during breaching is to protect forces reducing and maneuvering through an obstacle. the mgs platoon is designed to provide majority of the direct fire suppression tasks with it 105-mm main gun, m240 coax, and .50 cal. the stryker icvs can assist with its rws mk-19, .50 cal, or with their m240b machine gun. the infantry provide suppression with their m240b machine guns from its weapon squad. the mortar section can provide suppression with dismounted 60-mm and 120-mm mortars using he rounds. 7-109. obscuration needs to be employed to protect forces conducting obstacle reduction and the passage of assault forces. obscuration hampers enemy observation and target acquisition and conceals friendly activities and movement. obscuration smoke deployed on or near the enemy’s position minimizes its vision. screening smoke employed between the reduction area and the enemy conceals movement and reduction activities. it also degrades enemy ground and aerial observations. obscuration needs to be planned carefully to provide maximum degradation of enemy observation and fires, but it must not significantly degrade friendly fires and control. sources of smoke for the sbct infantry rifle company can come from artillery, mortars, smoke salvos on the stryker vehicles and smoke grenades for dismounts. the mortar section can provide both suppression and obscuration during a breach if using both the infantry 60-mm and mounted 120-mm mortars with smoke, white phosphorus (wp) and high-explosive ( he) rounds. 7-110. friendly forces secure the reduction area to prevent the enemy from interfering with obstacle reduction and the passage of the assault force through the lanes created during the reduction. security needs to be effective against outposts and fighting positions near the obstacle and against overwatching units, as necessary. the far side of the obstacle is secured by fires or be occupied before attempting any effort to reduce the obstacle. the attacking unit’s higher headquarters has the responsibility to isolate the breach area by fixing adjacent units, attacking enemy reserves in depth, and providing counter-fire support. identifying the extent of the enemy’s defenses is critical before selecting the appropriate technique to secure the point of breach. if the enemy controls the point of breach and cannot be adequately suppressed, enabling operations 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 7-25 the force secures the point of breach before it can reduce the obstacle. the breach force is resourced with enough maneuver assets to provide local security against the forces that the support force cannot sufficiently engage. elements within the breach force that secure the reduction area may be used to suppress the enemy once reduction is complete. 7-111. reduction is the creation of lanes through or over an obstacle to allow an attacking force to pass. the number and width of lanes created varies with the enemy situation, the assault force’s size a nd composition, and the scheme of maneuver. the lanes need to allow the assault force to rapidly pass through the obstacle. the breach force will reduce, proof (if required), mark, and report lane locations and the lanemarking method to higher headquarters. follow-on units will further reduce or clear the obstacle when required. reduction cannot be accomplished until effective suppression and obscuration are in place, the obstacle has been identified, and the point of breach is secure. 7-112. a breaching is not complete until — friendly forces have assaulted to destroy the enemy on the far side of the obstacle that is capable of placing or observing direct and indirect fires on the reduction area. battle handover with follow-on forces has occurred, unless no battle handover is planned. breaching organization 7-113. the commander organizes friendly forces to accomplish the breaching fundamentals quickly and effectively. this requires him to organize support, breach, and assault forces with the necessary assets to accomplish their roles. support force 7-114. the support force’s primary responsibility is to eliminate the enemy’s ability to interfere with a breach and is usually comprised of the mgs platoon, mortar section, and one infantry squad or platoon. the infantry element uses its weapons squad to provide an intermediate support force for engagements closer to the obstacle breach point. breach force 7-115. the breach force assist in the passage of the assault force by creating, proofing (if necessary), and marking lanes. this is usually comprised of an infantry platoon, or platoons and engineer assets, if available. the sniper team or small element may assist by conducting a small scale covert breach on wire obstacles or engaging the obstacle overwatch element with long range precision fires. assault force 7-116. the assault force’s primary mission is to destroy the enemy and seize terrain on the far side of the obstacle to prevent the enemy from placing direct fires on the created lanes. the stryker vehicle is designed to provide protection to the point of deployment. it should not be used as a fighting vehicle to assault the objective on the far side of the breach. the company commander should make the determination based on mission variable of mett-tc to risk possible destruction of a stryker vehicle to achieve speed and some protection for the assault force while moving through the breach to assault the objective. conducting the breach 7-117. breaching entails the coordinated efforts of three task-organized elements: the support force, the breach force, and the assault force. the discussion in this section covers the actions and responsibilities of these elements role in the operation. breaching organization 7-118. the commander in charge of the breach organizes forces to accomplish the five breaching fundamentals quickly and effectively. chapter 7 7-26 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016table 7-2. relationship between breaching organization and breaching fundamentals breaching organization breaching fundamentals responsibilities support force suppress obscure suppress enemy direct -fire systems coveri ng the reduction area. control obscuring smoke. prevent enemy forces from repositioning or counterattacking to place direct fires on the breach force. the mortar section can provide both suppression and obscuration with mix of 60-mm and 120 -mm mortars simultaneously. breach force suppress (provides additional suppression) obscure (provides additional obscuration in the reduction area) secure (provides local security) reduce create and mark the necessary lanes in an obstacle. secure the nearside and far side of an obstacle. defeat forces that can place immediate direct fires on the reduction area. report the lane status/location. assault force assault suppress (if necessary) destroy the enemy on the far side of an obstacle that is capable of placi ng direct fires on the reduction area. assist the support force with suppression if the enemy is not effectively suppressed. be prepared to breach follow -on or protective obstacles after passing through the reduction area. support force 7-119. this element usually leads movement of the breach elements. after identifying the obstacle, it moves to covered and concealed areas and establishes sbf positions. the support force leader sends a voice or digital spot report (spotrep) to the commander. this report describes the location and complexity of the obstacle, the composition of enemy forces that are overwatching the obstacle, and the location of possible bypass. the commander decides whether to maneuver to a bypass or to breach the obstacle. note. he needs to keep in mind that a bypass may lead to an enemy kill zone. 7-120. in either case, the support force suppresses any enemy elements that are overwatching the obstacle to allow the breach force to breach or bypass the obstacle. the support force should be in position t o request suppressive artillery fires and smoke for obscuration. as the breach and assault forces execute their missions, the support force lifts or shifts supporting fires. because the enemy is likely to engage the support enabling operations 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 7-27 force with artillery, the support force needs to be prepared to move to alternate positions while maintaining suppressive fires. breach force 7-121. the breach force receives a voice or digital spotrep identifying the location of the obstacle or bypass. it then organizes internally to meet these responsibilities — provide local security for the breach site as needed. conduct the actual breach. the breach force creates, proofs, and marks a lane through the obstacle or secures the bypass. move through the lane to provide local security for the assault force on the far side of the obstacle. in some instances, the breach force may move to firing positions that allow it to suppress enemy elements overwatching the obstacle. at other times, it may assault the enemy, with suppressive fires provided by the support force. breaching methods 7-122. the sbct infantry rifle company can create a lane by itself, if it is equipped with the assets and breach the type of obstacle encountered. if the sbct infantry rifle company does not have this capability, it provides close-in security for attached engineers with breaching assets. three breaching methods are — mechanical breaching, usually with mine plows or mine rakes. explosive breaching, employing such means as the mine-clearing line charge (miclic), m173 line charge, the mk 7 antipersonnel obstacle breaching system (apobs), or 1/4--pound blocks of tnt (2, 4, 6-trinitrotoluene (cas number 118-96-7; explosive). the m gs can also use this method for walls, structures, and buildings. (see appendix a. ) manual breaching, with soldiers probing by hand or using such items as grappling hooks, shovels, picks, axes, and chain saws. this may include using logs, or other available items to conduct a breach of a wire obstacle. manual breaching is the least preferred method. 7-123. in extreme cases, the commander may order an obstacle to be forced through. this technique requires the breach force to move in column formation through the obstacle location. if available, a disabled vehicle can be pushed ahead of the lead breach vehicle in an attempt to detonate mines or overrun barricades and wire obstacles . creating and proofing the lane 7-124. the mine plow and other engineer assets are the preferred breaching devices, but if they are not available the breach team may only have hand tools, picks, and shovels to create the lane. when properly equipped and supported, the platoon can create up to two lanes through an obstacle. 7-125. proofing verifies that a lane is free of mines and that the width and trafficability of the point of breach are suitable for the assault force. proofing can be conducted visually (against surface-laid minefields), electronically (mine detectors), or mechanically (mine clearing rollers [mcrs]) this process ensures that the lane is clear. marking the lane 7-126. after the lane is created and proofed, it can then be marked to ensure safe movement by vehicles and personnel; this is critical for follow-on forces that may not know the exact location of the cleared lane . distinctive markers show where the lane begins and ends. a visible line down the center is effective. another technique is to mark both sides of the breached lane. 7-127. to minimize the necessary breaching time, the proofing vehicle may simultaneously mark the lane. unit sops will dictate marking methods and materials, which commonly include the following: cleared lane mechanical marking system (clamms). pathfinder system. engineer stakes with tape. guides. chapter 7 7-28 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016chemical lights. expended shell casings. completing the breach 7-128. throughout the operation, the breach element provides continuous updates of the breach force’s progress to higher headquarters and other elements involved in the breach. they coordinate with the support force for suppressive fires. 7-129. after marking is complete, the breach element uses voice and digital systems to report the location of the lane and the method of marking to expedite the movement of the assault force. digital overlays enable units to move quickly to the breach lanes using the position navigation (posnav) or global positioning system (gps). 7-130. the assault force will often move behind the breach force and closely follow the breach vehicles through the new lane. assault force 7-131. while the breach is in progress, the assault force assists the support force or follows the breach force while maintaining cover and dispersion. once a lane is cleared through the obstacle, the assault force then moves through the breach. it secures the far side of the obstacle by physical occupation or continues the attack according to the commander’s intent. attachments 7-132. the types and quantities of these attachments depend on the mission and the number, size, and type of organizations requiring support. these attachments and assets are used to breach and reduce obstacles. engineer squad 7-133. the most versatile of all breaching assets, the engineer squad can conduct explosive or manual breaches, proof and mark lanes through an obstacle, and provide guides during breaching. while it conducts breaching and proofing, the squad is vulnerable to enemy direct and indirect fires, and is secured by the higher, supporting, or requesting unit due to the engineer squad’s limited capabilities. the engineer squad will probably have limited capabilities. mine-clearing line charge 7-134. used to breach wire and mine obstacles, the miclic can be either towed or mounted. this vehicle is known as the armored vehicle-launched miclic (avlm). it clears a lane 100 meters deep and 14 meters wide. 7-135. the miclic is fired 62 meters from the obstacle to get the full 100 meters of depth. the charge creates two skip zones, where the mines are not detonated, on the right and left side of the center line of the cleared lane. the skip zones, which are about 1.5 meters wide, necessitate the proofing of all miclic lanes. 7-136. the miclic is effective against pressure-activated antitank mines and against mechanically activated antipersonnel mines. effectiveness is limited against magnetically activated mines, to include scatterable mines, and those with multi-impulse (doub le-impact) or time-delay fuse. the miclic is not effective on severely broken ground where the line charge cannot lay flat. when detonated, the miclic has a danger area with a radius of 1600 meters. section i x – gap crossing 7-137. gap crossing is projecting combat power across a linear obstacle (wet or dry gap). it requires specific procedures, detailed planning, and technical support that differ from other tactical operations. the sbct infantry rifle company can take part in two types of gap crossing operations: hasty and deliberate. the company usually participates in a hasty or covert gap crossing as part of a sbct infantry battalion, enabling operations 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 7-29 and in deliberate gap-crossings as part of a brigade or larger element. the company can conduct a hasty or covert gap crossing independently when supported by attached engineer assets. (refer to attp 3-90.4 for more information.) 7-138. the commander may choose to conduct a hasty crossing when the momentum of the operation is maintained, when the banks are lightly held or undefended, and when sufficient engineer assets are available to support the crossing. despite the use of the term “hasty,” the commander use s all available time and assets to ensure that the conditions are set for the crossing. the crossing is similar to a breach in that suppression and obscuration normally precede any attempt to cross the obstruction. wet gap crossing 7-139. hasty wet gap-crossings are decentralized operations to cross inland bodies of water (such as canals, lakes, or rivers). these operations include crossing by tactical bridging, vehicle swimming or fording operations, or by infantry if the objective area is close to the wet-gap crossing point. 7-140. the sbct infantry battalion commander organizes his units into assault, support, and follow and support forces. the sbct infantry rifle company prepares to execute any of these missions as part of a sbct infantry battalion water crossing mission. assault force 7-141. the assault force conducts the initial assault across the body of water dismounted. assault boats, air assault aircraft transport, or rope bridge are used by the assault force to cross the body of water. the assault force usually seizes immediate objectives on the far side to secure the crossing site for other elements. if it has the capability, the assault force then continues the advance from the exit bank to the final objective. infantry elements establish local security on the exit bank to permit development of the crossing site. engineers move with the assault force to breach obstacles and open or improve trail s. support force 7-142. the support force comprises engineer elements, stryker vehicles, and mission command elements from the company headquarters. it develops the crossing site, emplaces the crossing means usually the rapid emplaced bridging system (rebs) organic to the engineer company (if applicable), and controls units moving into and away from the crossing site. the controlling commander may position the support force where it can assist the assault force in the direct assault on the crossing site. the engineers provide the following types of support for crossing operations to: improve mobility and reduce obstacles at the entrance and exit to the crossing site. improve fording sites. emplace assault boats, rafts, ferries, or bridges as the means of crossing the body of water. bridges used by supporting engineers include the rebs, armored vehicle launched bridge (avlb), wolverine, and ribbon or medium girder bridges. engineers might repair a bridge so that it can support the crossing operation. follow and support f orce 7-143. as the follow and support force, the sbct infantry rifle company’s primary mission is to provide operations security as the assault force moves to the far side of the water obstacle and seizes its immediate objectives. the sbct infantry rifle company does this mainly by suppressing defending enemy elements with both direct and indirect fires, and by firing or calling for smoke to screen the crossing site from enemy observation. it prepares to take over the assault force’s mission. dry gap-crossing operations 7-144. in most circumstances, hasty gap-crossing operations are limited to “dry” gaps (such as irrigation ditches, railroad embankments, and antitank ditches). operational considerations for a sbct infantry rifle company hasty gap crossing are similar to those for a breach, with the sbct infantry rifle company taskorganized into support, breach, and assault forces. the primary crossing means in the sbct infantry rifle company for hasty gap crossing is the rebs, which moves as part of the breach force. without a vehicle launched bridge, the company employs a deployable universal combat earthmover (deuce) or high chapter 7 7-30 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016mobility engineer excavator (hmee) to fill in or breach through the obstacle. additionally, if the mechanical method is unavailable, the team may employ a field-expedient method (for example, explosives) to facilitate the crossing. section x – troop movement 7-145. troop movement is the movement of troops from one place to another by any available means (adrp 3-90). the ability of a commander to posture friendly forces for a decisive or shaping operation depends upon the commander’s ability to move that force. the essence of battlefield agility is the capability of conducting rapid and orderly movement to concentrate combat power at decisive points and times. successful movement places troops and equipment at their destination at the proper time, ready for combat. there are three types of troop movement: administrative movement, tactical road march, and approach march (refer to fm 3-90-2 for more information). methods of movement 7-146. troop movements are made by dismounted and mounted marches using various combinations of organic combat and tactical vehicles, air, rail, and water means. the method employed depends upon the situation, size and composition of the moving unit, distance the unit covers, urgency of execution, and the condition of the troops. it depends on the availability, suitability, and capacity of the different means of transportation. tactical road march 7-147. a tactical road march is a rapid movement used to relocate units within an area of operations to prepare for combat operations (adrp 3-90). the primary consideration of the tactical road march is rapid movement. however, the moving force employs security measures even when contact with enemy groun d forces is not expected. stryker units conduct tactical road marches and approach marches. 7-148. units conducting road marches may or may not be organized into a combined arms formation. during a tactical road march, the commander is always prepared to take immediate action if the enemy attacks. stryker vehicles with air guard positions should be placed between stryker variants without them to provide better security during tactical road marches. organization 7-149. the commander organizes a march column into four elements: reconnaissance, quartering/advance party, main body, and trail party. these elements are further organized with considerations concerning vehicles that have similar rates of march, levels of fuel consumption, maintenance and recovery. all elements of a march column use the same route for a single movement. the battalion may designate an alternate route for more than one column. 7-150. march column subordinate elements are a march serial and a march unit. a march serial is a major subdivision of a march column that is organized under one commander who plans, regulates, and controls the serial. an example is a battalion serial formed from a brigade-size march column. it moves and halts under the control of a single commander who uses digital, fm, voice and visual signals. approach march 7-151. an approach march is the advance of a combat unit when direct contact with the enemy is intended (adrp 3-90). a unit using an approach march moves in a task-organized tactical formation to its destination. the approach march is used when the enemy’s approximate location is known, allowing the force to move with greater speed and less physical security or dispersion. it is like the movement to contact, and may be used as a technique to conduct a movement to contact. the approach march terminates in a march objective, such as an attack position, assembly area, or assault position. it can be used to transition to an attack. an approach march employs security forces (advance, flank, and rear) based upon the threat situation. 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 8-1 chapter 8 direct fire planning and control suppressing or destroying the enemy with direct fires is fundamental to success in close combat. direct fire is inherent in maneuver, as is close combat (adrp 3-0). the sbct infantry rifle company commander effectively plans to focus, distribute, and shift the overwhelming mass of his direct fire capability at critical locations and times to succeed in combat. efficient and effective fire control means that the company acquires the enemy and masses the effects of direct fires to achieve decisive results in the close fight. this chapter provides information about the principles of direct fire control, the fire control process, and direct fire planning. section i – fire control techniques 8-1. to successfully bring direct fires against an enemy force, commanders and leaders continuously apply the steps of the fire control process. at the heart of this process are two critical actions: rapid, accurate target acquisition and the massing of fire to achieve decisive effects on the target. 8-2. target acquisition is the detection, identification, and location of a target in sufficient detail to permit the effective employment of weapons. massing of fires is defined by the terminal effect on the enemy, not by the number of systems or rounds fired. 8-3. massing entails focusing fires at critical points and then distributing the fires for optimum effect. firing at multiple targets in depth prevents the enemy from dealing with any single threat and maneuvering from massing his fires against it. fire control process 8-4. the following discussion examines target acquisition and massing of fires using these basic steps of the fire control process: identify probable enemy locations and determine the enemy scheme of maneuver. determine where and how to mass fires. orient forces to speed target acquisition. shift or redistribute fires. identify probable enemy locations and determine the enemy scheme of maneuver 8-5. the commander and subordinate leaders plan and execute direct fires based on their estimate of the situation. an essential part of this estimate is the analysis of the terrain and the enemy force, which aids the commander in visualizing how the enemy will attack or defend a particular piece of terrain. (see figure 8-1.) a defending enemy’s defensive positions or an attacking enemy’s support positions are normally driven by intervisibility. typically, there are limited points on a piece of terrain that provide both good fields of fire and adequate cover for a defender. similarly, an attacking enemy has only a limited selection of avenues of approach that provides adequate cover and concealment. 8-6. coupled with available intelligence, an understanding of the effects of a specific piece of terrain on maneuver assists the commander in identifying probable enemy locations and likely avenues of approach both before and during the fight. the commander may use any or all of the following products or techniques in developing and updating the analysis: an enemy situational template based on the analysis of terrain and enemy. chapter 8 8-2 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 a spot report or contact report on enemy locations and activities. reconnaissance of the ao. legend: mgs = mobile gun system figure 8-1. example of identifying probable enemy locations and determining enemy scheme of maneuver determine where and how to mass fires 8-7. to achieve decisive effects, friendly forces need to mass their fires. effective massing requires the commander both to direct the fires of subordinate elements and to distribute the effects of the fires. based on his estimate of the situation and his concept of the operation, the commander identifies points where he wants to, or must, concentrate the unit’s fires ( see figure 8-2 on -3). most often, these are locations he has identified as probable enemy positions or points along likely avenues of approach where the unit can mass direct fires. because subordinate elements may not initially be oriented on the point where the commander wants to mass fires, he may issue a fire command to the fires. at the same time, the commander uses direct fire control measures and effectively distributes the fires of his elements, which are now focused on the same point. 8-8. to achieve the greatest mass effects the company commander balances the differences of the maximum effective ranges of the crew served weapons on the icvs, mgs, mortars, and infantry. by placing these weapon systems at equal distance from one another in firing position prevents a maximum effect of all weapon systems firing simultaneously. therefore weapon systems with shorter maximum effective engagement ranges should be in positions forward of ones with longer maximum effective direct fire planning and control 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 8-3 engagement ranges. the company leadership should closely examine surface danger zones (sdz) to ensure that firing positions are within safe distance of the engagement area. figure 8-2. example of determining where and how to mass fires orient forces to speed target acquisition 8-9. to effectively engage the enemy with direct fires, friendly forces need to acquire enemy elements rapidly and accurately. orienting friendly forces on probable enemy locations and on likely avenues of approach will speed target acquisition (see figure 8 -3). conversely, failure to orient subordinate elements results in slower acquisition; this greatly increases the likelihood that enemy forces will be able to engage first. the clock direction orientation method, which is prescribed in most unit sops, is good for achieving all-around security; however, it does not ensure that friendly forces are most effectively oriented to detect the enemy. to achieve this critical orientation, the commander typically designates trps on or near probable enemy locations and avenues of approach. he orients his subordinate elements using directions of fire or sectors of fire. normally, the gunners on crew-served weapons scan the designated direction, sector of fire, or area while other crewmen observe alternate sectors of fire or areas to provide all-around security. chapter 8 8-4 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 figure 8-3. example of orienting forces to speed target acquisition shift and redistribute f ires 8-10. as the engagement proceeds, leaders shift fires to direct and redistribute the effects based on their evolving estimate of the situation. sa becomes an essential part of the fire control process at this point. the commander and subordinate leaders apply the same techniques and considerations, to include fire control measures that they used earlier to direct and distribute fires. a variety of situations dictate shifting of fires, to include the following: appearance of an enemy force posing a greater threat than the one currently being engaged. extensive attrition of the enemy force being engaged, creating the possibility of target overkill. attrition of friendly elements that are engaging the enemy force. change in the ammunition status of the friendly elements that are engaging the enemy force. maneuver of enemy or friendly forces resulting in terrain masking. increased fratricide and friendly fire risk as a maneuvering friendly element closes with the enemy force being engaged. principles of direct fire 8-11. effective fire control requires a unit to acquire the enemy and mass the effects of fires rapidly to achieve decisive results in a close fight. when planning and executing direct fires, the commander and subordinate leaders need to know how to apply several fundamental principles. the purpose of the principles of direct fire is not to restrict the actions of subordinates. applied correctly, they help the sbct direct fire planning and control 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 8-5 infantry rifle company to accomplish its primary goal in any direct fire engagement; that is, both to acquire first and shoot first. these principles give subordinates the freedom to act quickly upon acquisition of the enemy. this discussion focuses on the following principles: mass the effects of fire. destroy the greatest threat first. avoid target overkill. employ the best weapon for specific target. minimize exposure. plan and implement fratricide and friendly fire avoidance measures. plan for limited visibility conditions. plan for degraded capabilities. mass the effects of fire 8-12. the sbct infantry rifle company mass es its fires to achieve decisive results. massing entails focusing fires at critical points and distributing the effects. random application of fires is unlikely to have a decisive effect. for example, concentrating the sbct infantry rifle company’s fires at a single target may ensure its destruction or suppression; however, that fire control technique will probably not achieve a decisive effect on the enemy formation or position. destroy the greatest threat first 8-13. the order in which the sbct infantry rifle company engages enemy forces is in direct relation to the danger the enemy presents. the threat posed by the enemy depends on his weapons, range, and positioning. presented with multiple targets, a unit will, in most situations, initially concentrate fires to destroy the greatest threat, and then distribute fires over the remainder of the enemy force. avoid target overkill 8-14. the company uses only the amount of fire to achieve the necessary effect. target overkill wastes ammunition and diverts weapons that are better employed acquiring and engaging other targets. the idea of having every weapon engaging a different target is tempered by the requirement to destroy the greatest threats first. employ the best weapon for specific target 8-15. using the appropriate weapon for the target increases the probability of rapid enemy destruction or suppression; at the same time, it saves ammunition. the sbct infantry rifle company has many weapons with which to engage the enemy. target type, range, and exposure are key factors in determining the weapon and ammunition that should be employed, as are weapons and ammunition availability and desired targets effects. leaders should consider individual crew capabilities when deciding on the employment of weapons. the company commander arrays his forces based on the terrain, enemy, and desired effects of fires. as an example, when he expects an enemy dismounted assault in restricted terrain, the commander would employ his infantry squads, taking advantage of their ability to best engage numerous fast-moving targets. minimize exposure 8-16. units increase their survivability by exposing themselves to the enemy only to the extent necessary to engage him effectively. natural or man-made defilade provides the best cover from lethal direct fir e munitions. infantry minimize their exposure by constantly seeking effective available cover, attempting to engage the enemy from the flank, remaining dispersed, firing from multiple positions, and limiting engagement times. plan and implement fratricide avoidance measures 8-17. the commander needs to be proactive in reducing the risk of fratricide and friendly fire, and noncombatant casualties. he has numerous tools to assist him in this effort: identification training for combat vehicles and aircraft, the unit ’s weapons safety posture, the weapons control status (wcs), chapter 8 8-6 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016recognition markings, and a cop to include range cards, sector sketches, and rehearsals. knowledge and employment of applicable roe are the primary means of preventing noncombatant casualties. note. because it is difficult to distinguish between friendly and enemy infantry soldiers, the commander constantly monitors the position of friendly infantry squads. plan for limited visibility conditions 8-18. at night, limited visibility fire control equipment enables the sbct infantry rifle company to engage enemy forces at nearly the same ranges that apply during the day. obscurants such as dense fog, heavy smoke, and blowing sand can reduce the capabilities of thermal and infrared (ir) equipment. the commander should therefore develop contingency plans for such extreme limited visibility conditions. although decreased acquisition capabilities have minimal effect on area fire, point target engagements will likely occur at decreased ranges. typically, firing positions, whether offensive or defensive, are adjusted closer to the area or point where the commander intends to concentrate fires. another alternative is the use of visual or ir illumination when there is insufficient ambient light for passive light intensification devices. note. vehicles equipped with thermal sights can assist infantry squads in detecting and engaging enemy infantry forces in conditions such as heavy smoke and low illumination. plan for degraded capabilities 8-19. leaders initially develop plan s based on their units’ maximum capabilities; they make backup plans for implementation in the event of casualties or weapon damage or failure. while leaders cannot anticipate or plan for every situation, they should develop plans for what they view as the most probable occurrences. building redundancy into these plans, such as having two systems observe the same sector of fire, is an invaluable asset when the situation (and the number of available systems) permits. designating alternate sectors of fire provides a means of shifting fires if adjacent elements are knocked out of action. section ii – direct fire planning 8-20. the sbct infantry company commander plans direct fires as part of the tlps. the commander considers essential steps, such as where and how the company can and will mass fires, as he develops his concept of the operations. overview 8-21. leaders plan direct fires and distribute and control their fire. determining where and how the sbct infantry rifle company can mass fires is an essential step in this process. 8-22. based on where and how they want to direct and distribute fires, leaders can establish the weapons ready postures for their elements and triggers for initiating fires. during mission preparation, leaders plan and conduct rehearsals of direct fires (and of the fire control process) based on the estimate of the situation. 8-23. the commander plans direct fires in conjunction with development of his estimate of the situation and completion of the plan. determining where and how the sbct rifle company can and will mass fires are essential steps as the commander develops his concept of the operation. 8-24. after identifying probable enemy locations, the commander determines points or areas where he can concentrate combat power. his visualization of where and how the enemy will attack or defend assists him in determining the volume of fires he focus es at particular points to have a decisive effect. if he intends to mass the fires of more than one subordinate element, the commander establish es the means for distributing fires effectively. 8-25. based on where and how they want to concentrate and distribute fires, the commander and subordinate leaders can then establish the weapons-ready postures for sbct infantry rifle company elements and triggers for initiating fires. the commander evaluates the risk of fratricide and friendly fire direct fire planning and control 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 8-7 and establishes controls to prevent it; these measures include the designation of recognition markings, wcs, and weapons safety posture. 8-26. after determining where and how they will mass and distribute fires, the commander and subordinate leaders then orient elements so they can rapidly and accurately acquire the enemy. they can war-game the selected coa or concept of the operation to determine probable requirements for refocusing and redistributing fires and to establish other required controls. during mission preparation, the commander plans and conducts rehearsals of direct fires (and of the fire control process) based on his estimate of the situation. 8-27. the commander and his subordinate leaders continue to apply planning procedures and considerations throughout execution. they adjust direct fires based on a continuously updated estimate of the situation, combining sa with the latest available intelligence. when necessary, they apply effective direct fire sops, which are covered in the following discussion. standard operating procedures 8-28. a well-rehearsed direct fire sop ensures quick, predictable actions by all members of the sbct infantry rifle company. the commander bases the various elements of the sop on the capabilities of his force and on anticipated conditions and situations. sop elements should include standard means for focusing fires, distributing their effects, orienting forces, and preventing fratricide and friendly fire. the commander should adjust the direct fire sop whenever changes to anticipated and actual mett-tc factors become apparent. 8-29. if the commander does not issue any other instructions, the sbct infantry rifle company begins the engagement using the sop. the commander can subsequently use a fire command to direct or redistribute fires. the following paragraphs discuss specific sop provisions for focusing fires, distributing fires, orienting forces, and preventing fratricide and friendly fire. focusing fires 8-30. trps are a common means of focusing fires. one technique is to establish a standard respective position for trps in relation to friendly elements and then to consistently number the trps, such as from left to right. this allows leaders to quickly determine and communicate the location of the trps. distributing fires 8-31. two useful means of distributing the sbct infantry rifle company’s fires are engagement priorities and target array. one technique is to assign an engagement priority, by type of enemy vehicle or weapon, for each type of friendly weapons system. the target array technique can assist in distribution by assigning specific friendly elements to engage enemy elements of similar capabilities. orienting forces 8-32. a standard means of orienting friendly forces is to assign a primary direction of fire, using a trp, to orient each element on a probable enemy position or likely avenue of approach. to provide all-around security, the sop can supplement the primary direction of fire with sectors of fire using a friendly-based quadrant. the following example sop elements illustrate the use of these techniques: the center (front) platoon’s primary direction of fire is trp 2 (center) until otherwise specified; the platoon is responsible for the front two quadrants. the left flank platoon’s pr imary direction of fire is trp 1 (left) until otherwise specified; the platoon is responsible for the left two friendly quadrants (overlapping with the center platoon). the right flank platoon’s primary direction of fire is trp 3 (right) until otherwise sp ecified; the platoon is responsible for the right two friendly quadrants (overlapping with the center platoon). avoiding f ratricide and friendly fire 8-33. a primary means of minimizing fratricide and friendly fire risk is to establish a standard wcs of weapons tight, which requires positive enemy identification before engagement. the sop dictates ways of identifying friendly rifle squads and other dismounted elements. techniques include using arm chapter 8 8-8 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016bands, medical heat pads, or an ir light source or detonating a smoke grenade of a designated color at the appropriate time. minimizing the risk of fratricide and friendly fire in the sbct infantry rifle company can be accomplished through bft/jcr (if equipped); however, this does not remove the sbct infantry rifle comp any commander’s responsibility to plan for fratricide and friendly fire avoidance. 8-34. finally, the sop address es the most critical requirement of fratricide and friendly fire prevention — maintaining sa. it directs subordinate leaders to inform the commander, adjacent elements, and subordinates whenever a friendly force is moving or preparing to move. section iii – direct fire control 8-35. the small unit commander communicates to his subordinates the manner, method, and time to initiate, shift, and mass fires, and when to disengage by using direct fire control measures. the commander should control his unit’s fires so he can direct the engagement of enemy systems to gain the greatest effect. the commander uses ipb and reconnaissance to determine the most advantageous way to use direct fire control measures to mass the effects on the enemy and reduce fratricide and friendly fire from direct fire systems. (refer to atp 2-01.3 for more information.) fire control measures 8-36. fire control measures are the means by which the commander or subordinate leaders control fires. application of these concepts, procedures, and techniques assists the unit in acquiring the enemy, focusing fires on him, distributing the effects of the fires, and preventing fratricide and friendly fire. at the same time, no single measure is sufficient to effectively control fires. at the sbct infantry rifle company level, fire control measures are effective only if the entire unit has a common understanding of what they mean and how to employ them. the following focuses on the various fire control measures employed by the sbct infantry rifle company. table 8-1 lists the control measures; it is organized by whether they are terrain-based or threat-based. (refer to fm 3-90-1 for more information.) table 8-1. common fire control measures terrain -based fire control measures threat -based fire control measures target reference point (trp) rules of engagement (roe) engagement area (ea) weapons ready posture sector of fire weapons safety posture direction of fire weapons control status (wcs) terrain -based quadrant engagement priorities friendly -based quadrant trigger maximum engagement line (mel); restrictive fire line (rfl); final protective line (fpl) engagement techniques; fire patterns; target array terrain -based fire control measures 8-37. the sbct infantry rifle company commander uses terrain-based fire control measures to direct and control fires on a particular point, line, or area rather than on a specific enemy element. the following paragraphs describe the ttps associated with this type of control measure. target reference point 8-38. a trp is a recognizable point on the ground that leaders use to orient friendly forces, and to concentrate and control direct fires. when leaders designate trps as indirect fire targets, they can use the trps when calling for and adjusting indirect fires. leaders designate trps at probable enemy locations and along likely avenues of approach. these points can be natural or man-made. a trp can be an established site (such as a hill or a building), or an impromptu feature designated as a trp on the spot (such as a burning enemy vehicle or smoke generated by an artillery round). friendly units can construct markers to serve as trps (see figure 8-4 on -9). ideally, trps should be visible in three observation direct fire planning and control 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 8-9 modes (unaided, passive-ir, and thermal) so that all forces can see them. examples of trps include the following features and objects: prominent hill mass. distinctive building. observable enemy position. destroyed vehicle. ground-burst illumination. smoke round for immediate engagements only; this is the least preferred method. legend: trp = target reference point figure 8-4. examples of constructed trp markers chapter 8 8-10 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 engagement area 8-39. this fire control measure is an area along an enemy avenue of approach where the commander intends to mass the fires of available weapons to destroy an enemy force. the size and shape of the ea are determined by the degree of relatively unobstructed intervisibility available to the unit’s weapons systems in their firing positions and by the maximum range of those weapons. typically, commanders delineate responsibility within the ea by assigning each platoon a sector of fire or direction of fire. sector of fire 8-40. a sector of fire is a defined area that must be covered by direct fire. leaders assign sectors of fire to subordinate elements, crew-served weapons, and individual soldiers to ensure coverage of an area of responsibility. they may limit the sector of fire of an element or weapon to prevent accidental engagement of an adjacent unit. in assigning sectors of fire, commanders and subordinate leaders consider the number and types of weapons available. they consider acquisition system type and field of view in determining the width of a sector of fire. for example, while unaided vision has a wide field of view, its ability to detect and identify targets at range and in limited visibility conditions is restricted. conversely, most fire control acquisitions systems have greater detection and identification ranges than the unaided eye, but their field of view is narrow. the means of designating sectors of fire include the following: target reference points. clock direction. terrain-based quadrants. friendly-based quadrants. azimuth or cardinal direction. direction of fire 8-41. a direction of fire is an orientation or point used to assign responsibility for a particular location in the ao that needs to be covered by direct fire. leaders designate directions of fire for the purpose of acquisition or engagement by subordinate elements, crew-served weapons, or individual soldiers. direction of fire is most commonly employed when assigning sectors of fire would be difficult or impossible because of limited time or insufficient reference points. means of designating a direction of fire include the following: closest trp. clock direction. azimuth or cardinal direction. tracer on target. infrared laser pointer. quadrants 8-42. quadrants are subdivisions of an area created by superimposing an imaginary pair of perpendicular axes over the terrain to create four separate areas of fire. quadrants can be based on the terrain, on friendly forces, or on the enemy formation. note. the technique in which quadrants are based on the enemy formation is usually referred to as the target array; it is covered in the discussion of threat-based fire control measures. 8-43. the method of quadrant numbering is established in the unit sop. however, take care to avoid confusion when quadrants based on terrain, friendly forces, and the enemy formations are used simultaneously. terrain-based quadrant 8-44. a terrain-based quadrant entails use of a constructed trp to designate the center point of the axes that divide the area into four quadrants. this technique can be employed in both offensive and defensive tasks. in the offense, the commander designates the center of the quadrant using a feature or by creating a reference point (for example, using a ground-burst illumination round, a smoke-marking round, or a fire direct fire planning and control 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 8-11 ignited by incendiary or tracer rounds). the axes delineating the quadrants run parallel and perpendicular to the direction of movement. in the defense, the commander designates the center of the quadrant using a constructed trp. 8-45. in the examples shown in figure 8-5, quadrants are marked using the letter “q” and a number (q1 to q4); quadrant numbers are in the same relative positions as on military map sheets (from q1 as the upper left-hand quadrant clockwise to q4 as the lower left-hand quadrant). legend: ea = engagement area, mgs = mobile gun system, q = quadrant, trp = target reference point figure 8-5. examples of terrain-based quadrants friendly-based quadrant 8-46. the friendly-based quadrant technique entails superimposing quadrants over the unit’s formation. the center point is based on the center of the formation, and the axes run parallel and perpendicular to the general direction of travel. for rapid orientation, the friendly quadrant technique may be better than the clock direction method. this is because the target may look different as seen from different locations. figure 8-6 illustrates use of friendly-based quadrants. chapter 8 8-12 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 figure 8-6. example of friendly-based quadrants maximum engagement line 8-47. a mel is the linear depiction of the farthest limit of effective fire for a weapon or unit. this line is determ ined by either the weapon’s or unit’s maximum effective range and by the effects of terrain. (for example, slope, vegetation, structures, and other features provide cover and concealment that may prevent the weapon from engaging to the maximum effective range.) an mel serves several purposes. the commander can use it to prevent crews from engaging beyond the maximum effective range, to define criteria for the establishment of triggers, and to delineate the maximum extent of area of operations on the sector sketch. restrictive fire line 8-48. a rfl is a linear fire control measure beyond which engagement is prohibited without coordination. in the offense, the commander can designate an rfl to prevent a base of fire element from firing into the area where an assaulting element is maneuvering. this technique is particularly important when armored vehicles support the maneuver of infantry squads. in the defense, the commander may establish an rfl to prevent the unit from engaging a friendly rifle squad positioned in restricted terrain on the flank of an avenue of approach. final protective line 8-49. the final protective line (fpl) is a line of fire established where an enemy assault is to be checked by the interlocking fires of all available weapons. the unit reinforces this line with protective obstacles and with fpf whenever possible. initiation of the fpf is the signal for elements, crews, and individual soldiers to shift fires to their assigned portion of the fpl. they spare no ammunition in repelling the enemy assault, a particular concern for machine guns and other automatic weapons. direct fire planning and control 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 8-13 threat -based fire control measures 8-50. the sbct infantry rifle company commander uses threat-based fire control measures to concentrate and control fires by directing the unit to engage a specific enemy element rather than to fire on a point or area. the following paragraphs describe the ttp associated with this type of control measure. rules of engagement 8-51. roe specify the circumstances and limitations under which forces may engage. they include definitions of combatant and noncombatant elements and prescribe the treatment of noncombatants. factors influencing roe are national command policy, the mission and commander’s intent, the oe, and the law of war. roe always recognize a soldier’s right of s elf-defense; at the same time, they clearly define circumstances in which he may fire. 8-52. for an example of company level roe, during a cordon and search mission, the command may establish a wcs of weapons tight for the main gun. the commander could do this because higher command directives explicitly restrict the use of the main gun as an explosive breach technique. weapons -ready posture 8-53. weapons-ready posture is the selected ammunition and indexed range for vehicle, individual, and crew-served weapons. it is a means by which leaders use their estimate of the situation to specify the ammunition and range for the most probable anticipated engagement. ammunition selection depends on the target type, but the leader may adjust it based on engagement priorities, desired effects, and effective range. range selection depends on the anticipated engagement range; it is affected by terrain intervisibility, weather, and light conditions. within the sbct infantry rifle company, weapons-ready posture affects the types and quantities of ammunition loaded in ready boxes, stowed in ready racks, and carried by rifle squads. the following considerations apply: examples of weapons-ready posture – an m203 grenadier, who se most likely engagement, is to cover dead space at 200 meters from his position, might load high-explosive dual-purpose (hedp) ammunition, and set 200 meters on his quadrant sight. a soldier might dismount with an at-4 instead of a javelin to prepare for an engagement in a wooded area where engagement ranges are extremely short. an mgs vehicle might battle carry high-explosive plastic (hep) round if operating in an urban environment. weapons -safety posture 8-54. weapons-safety posture is an ammunition handling instruction that enables the commander to control the safety of his unit’s weapons precisely. leaders’ supervision of the weapons -safety posture, and soldiers’ adherence to it, minimizes the risk of accidental discharge and fratricide and friendly fire. table 8-2 outlines procedures and considerations for the sbct infantry rifle company when using the four weapons safety postures, listed in ascending order of restrictiveness: ammunition loaded. ammunition locked. ammunition prepared. weapons cleared. 8-55. when setting and adjusting the weapons-safety posture, the commander weighs the desire to prevent accidental discharges against the requirement for immediate action based on the enemy threat. if the threat of direct contact is high, for example, the commander could establish the weapons safety posture as ammunition loaded. if the requirement for action is less immediate, he might lower the posture to ammunition locked or ammunition prepared. the commander can designate different weapons safety postures for different elements of the unit. chapter 8 8-14 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 table 8-2. weapons safety posture levels weapons safety posture vehicle infantry squad weapons and ammunition ammunition loaded 50. cal machine gun ammunition on feed tray.

(icv) magazines locked into rifles. machine gun and saw ammunition on feed tray; bolt locked forward. grenade launcher unloaded. ammunition prepared 50. cal machine gun ammunition boxes filled. (icv) magazines, ammunition boxes, launcher grenades, and hand grenades prepared but stowed in pouches/vests. weapons cleared 50. cal machine gun cleared with bolt locked to the rear. (icv) magazine, ammu nition boxes, and launcher grenades removed; weapons cleared. weapons control status 8-56. the three levels of wcs outline the conditions, based on target identification criteria, under which friendly elements can engage. the commander sets and adjusts the wcs based on friendly and enemy disposition, and the clarity of the situation. in general, the higher the probability of fratricide and friendly fire, the more restrictive the wcs. the three levels, in descending order of restrictiveness, are as follows: weapons hold. engage only if engaged or ordered to engage. weapons tight. engage only targets that are positively identified as enemy. weapons free. engage any targets that are not positively identified as friendly. 8-57. as an example, the commander may establish the weapons control status as weapons hold when friendly forces are conducting a passage of lines. by maintaining situational understanding of his own elements and adjacent friendly forces, however, he may lower the wcs. in such a case, the commander may set a weapons free status when he knows there are no friendly elements near the engagement. this permits his elements to engage targets at extended ranges even though it is difficult to distinguish targets accurately at ranges beyond 2000 meters under combat conditions. another consideration is that the wcs is extremely important for forces using combat identification systems. establishing the wcs as weapons free permits leaders to engage an unknown target when they fail to get a friendly response. engagement priorities 8-58. engagement priorities provide platoon and company level direct/indirect fire distribution examples that combine engagement priorities (targeting by composition) and fire patterns/target arrays (targeting by disposition). this can serve one or more of the following critical fire control functions: 8-59. prioritize hpts. in concert with his concept of the operation, the commander determines which target types provide the greatest payoff. he can then set these as a unit engagement priority. (for example, he may decide that destroying enemy engineer assets is the best way to prevent the enemy from breaching an obstacle.) 8-60. employ the best weapons for the target. establishing engagement priorities for specific friendly systems increases the effectiveness with which the unit employs its weapons. as an example, the engagement priority for the javelin could be enemy tanks first, then enemy personnel carriers. this would decrease the chance that the company’s lighter systems will engage enemy armored vehicles. direct fire planning and control 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 8-15 8-61. distribute the unit’s fires. establishing different priorities for similar friendly systems helps to prevent overkill and achieve effective distribution of fires. (for example, the commander may designate the enemy’s tanks as the initial priority for the mgs platoon, while making the enemy’s personnel carriers the priority for another platoon.) this would decrease the chances of units engaging against two enemy tanks, while ignoring the dangers posed by the personnel carriers. trigger 8-62. a trigger is a specific set of conditions that dictates initiation of fires. often referred to as engagement criteria, a trigger specifies the circumstances in which subordinate elements should engage . the circumstances can be based on a friendly or enemy event. (for example, the trigger for a friendly platoon to initiate engagement could be three or more enemy combat vehicles passing or crossing a given point or line.) this line can be any natural or man-made linear feature (such as a road, ridge line, or stream) . it may be a line perpendicular to the unit’s orientation, delineated by one or more reference points. engagement techniques 8-63. engagement techniques are effects-oriented fire distribution measures. the following engagement techniques, the most common in sbct infantry rifle company operations, are covered in this discussion: point fire. area fire. simultaneous. alternating fire. observed fire. sequential fire. time of suppression. reconnaissance by fire. point fire 8-64. point fire entails concentrating the effects of a unit’s fire against a specific, identified target such as a vehicle, machine gun bunker, or atgm position. when leaders direct point fire, all of the unit’s weapons engage the target, firing until it is destroyed or the required time of suppression has expired. employing converging fires from dispersed positions makes point fire more effective because the target is engaged from multiple directions. the unit may initiate an engagement using point fire against the most dangerous threat, and then revert to area fire against other, less threatening point targets. note. use of point fire is fairly rare because a unit seldom encounters a single, clearly identified enemy weapon. area fire 8-65. area fir e involves distributing the effects of a unit’s fire over an area in which enemy positions are numerous or are not obvious. if the area is large, leaders assign sectors of fire to subordinate elements using a terrain-based distribution method such as the quadrant technique. typically, the primary purpose of the area fire is suppression; however, sustaining effective suppression requires judicious control of the rate of fire. simultaneous fire 8-66. units employ simultaneous fire to rapidly mass the effects of their fires or to gain fire superiority. (for example, a unit may initiate an sbf with simultaneous fire, and then revert to alternating or sequential fire to maintain suppression.) simultaneous fire is employed to negate the low probability of the hit and kill of certain antiarmor weapons. as an example, a rifle squad may employ simultaneous fire with its javelins to ensure rapid destruction of an enemy armored fighting vehicle that is engaging a friendly position. chapter 8 8-16 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016alternating fire 8-67. in alternating fire, pairs of elements continuously engage the same point or area target one at a time. (for example, a sbct infantry rifle company may alternate fires of two platoons, an infantry platoon may alternate the fires of its squads, or an infantry platoon may alternate the fires of a pair of machine guns.) alternating fire permits the unit to maintain suppression for a longer duration than does volley fire; it also forces the enemy to acquire and engage alternating points of fire. observed fire 8-68. observed fire is usually used when the sbct infantry rifle company is in protected defensive positions with engagement ranges in excess of 2500 meters. it can be employed between elements of the company (such as the infantry platoon lasing and observing while the machine gun section fires) or between machine guns in the section of a platoon. the commander or platoon leader directs one element or section to engage. the remaining elements or sections observe fires and prepare to engage on order in case the engaging element consistently misses its targets, experiences a malfunction, or runs low on ammunition. observed fire allows for mutual observation and assistance while protecting the location of the observing elements. sequential fire 8-69. sequential fire entails the subordinate elements of a unit engaging the same point or area target one after another in an arranged sequence. sequential fire can help to prevent the waste of ammunition, as when an infantry rifle platoon waits to see the effects of the first javelin before firing another. sequential fire permits elements that have already fired to pass on intelligence they have learned from the engagement. an example would be an infantryman who missed an enemy armored fighting vehicle with javelin fires, passing range and lead information to the next soldier preparing to engage the enemy armored fighting vehicle. time of suppression 8-70. time of suppression is the period, specified by the commander, during which an enemy position or force must be suppressed. suppression time is typically dependent on the time it will take a supported element to maneuver. usually, a unit suppresses an enemy position using the sustained rate of fire of its automatic weapons. in planning for sustained suppression, leaders needs to consider several factors: the estimated time of suppression, the size of the area being suppressed, the type of enemy force to be suppressed, range to the target, rates of fire, and available ammunition quantities. reconnaissance by fire 8-71. reconnaissance by fire is the process of engaging possible enemy locations to elicit a tactical response (such as return fire or movement). this response permits the commander and subordinate leaders to acquire the target and then to mass fires against the enemy element. typically, the commander directs a subordinate element to conduct the reconnaissance by fire. (for example, he may direct an overwatching platoon to conduct the reconnaissance by fire against a probable enemy position before initiating movement by a bounding element.) fire patterns 8-72. fire patterns are a threat-based measure designed to distribute the fires of a unit simultaneously between multiple, similar targets. platoons use those most often to distribute fires across an enemy formation. leaders designate and adjust fire patterns based on terrain and the anticipated enemy formation. the basic fire patterns, illustrated in figure 8-7 on -17, are — frontal. cross. depth. frontal fire 8-73. leaders may initiate frontal fire when targets are arrayed in front of the unit in a lateral configuration. weapons systems engage targets to their respective fronts. (for example, the left flank direct fire planning and control 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 8-17 weapon engages the left-most target; the right flank weapon engages the right-most target.) as weapons systems destroy targets, weapons shift fires toward the center of the enemy formation from near too far. cross fire 8-74. leaders initiate cross fire when targets are arrayed laterally across the unit’s front in a manner that permits diagonal fires at the enemy’s flank, or when obstructions prevent unit weapons from firing frontally. right flank weapons engage the left-most targets; left flank weapons engage the right-most targets. firing diagonally across an engagement area provides more flank shots, thus increasing the chance of kills. it reduces the possibility of the enemy detecting friendly elements should the enemy continue to move forward. as friendly elements destroy targets, weapons shift fires toward the center of the enemy formation. depth fire 8-75. leaders initiate depth fire when enemy targets disperse in depth, perpendicular to the unit. center weapons engage the closest targets; flank weapons engage deeper targets. as the unit destroys targets, weapons shift fires toward the center of the enemy formation. figure 8-7. examples of fire patterns target array 8-76. target array enables the commander to distribute fires when the enemy force is concentrated and terrain-based controls are inadequate. forces create this threat-based distribution measure by superimposing a quadrant pattern on the enemy formation. soldiers center the pattern on the enemy formation, with the axes running parallel and perpendicular to the enemy’s direction of travel. the target array fire control measure is effective against an enemy with a well-structured organization and standardized doctrine. however, it may prove less effective against an enemy that presents few organized formations, or does not follow strict prescribed tactics. leaders describe quadrants using the quadrants’ relative locations. the examples in figure 8-8 illustrate the target array technique. chapter 8 8-18 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 legend: trp = target reference point figure 8-8. examples of target array fire commands 8-77. fire commands are oral orders issued by leaders to direct and distribute fires when necessary to achieve decisive effects against the enemy. they allow leaders to rapidly and concisely articulate their firing instructions using a standard format. unit fire commands (refer to attp 3-21.9 for more information on fire commands) include these elements, which are discussed below: alert. weapon or ammunition (optional). target description. orientation. range (optional). control (optional). execution. 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 a-1 appendix a breaching using mgs the stryker infantry rifle company has the capability to breach structures using the mgs. this technique requires the infantry and mgs working in direct coordination with one another to accomplish their common goal. this procedure is dangerous and risk mitigation factors must be implemented to execute successfully. when executed correctly the infantry have a significant advantage when they enter and clear a structure because of the shock of the impacting round created at the breach point and inside the structure from the mgs. section i – plan a-1. commanders quickly decide if conducting the breach using mgs is the best technique for the situation. the factors of mett-tc and roe will assist the commander in this decision. commanders weigh the distance of the infantry element to the breach point in their planning. if the infantry cannot quickly assault the breach point, the enemy may have an opportunity to reinforce or recover from the blast. a-2. many factors make this technique potentially dangerous and each need to be addressed and mitigated. planning for a breach in an urban environment using the mgs has many planning considerations including — infantry placement. target breach point. structure/wall construction type. munition selection and arming distance. blast effect radius. a-3. risk mitigation of the infantry element is critical and should include mitigating the effects of the environment such as — blast effects and radius of debris. hearing protection. personnel protective posture. the distance to place infantry from the breach point. surface danger zones (sdzs) of the mgs. a-4. mgs vehicle commanders coordinate directly with the infantry squad/platoon to determine the breach point. infantry elements need to have a means to mark the breach point. this could include the following: laser pointer. smoke. chalk (if site exterior is secure). 40-mm target practice tracer (tpt) round. mark with tracer (least preferred as it indicates infantry positions). a-5. wall and structure considerations include all the different types of material used in construction and may include concrete, reinforced concrete with rebar, mud, brick, and cinder blocks, stone, wood, and so forth. the composition and thickness of the structure will be an indicator for the type of munitions used and the number of rounds needed to create the breach point. for a reinforced concrete rebar wall the most likely round to use would be hep as opposed to a wooden structure where one canister round may be preferred. appendix a a-2 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 consideration of the structure that the wall supports and the support structures within the building need to be taken into account . the round may not stop at the point of impact but may proceed into the structure. calculating where the support structures are for the engagement will allow the person marking the target and the gunner to engage. to collapse the structure the gunner will target its support. to create a breach point the gunner would avoid damaging the support. a-6. munitions selection may include the following rounds; high-explosive plastic tracer (hep-t), highexplosive antitank tracer (heat-t), and canister. each has capabilities suited for engaging different types of structures. arming distances of these munitions is a major consideration. see table a-1 for the arming distances for each type of round: table a-1. munition selection round arming distance max effective range optimal target blast effects at point of impact 0 obliquity max angle of obliquity to structure m393a3 hep-t 11 to 33 meters 3000m wall breach (reinforced concrete, mud/ adobe wall), field fortifications, bunker defeat. 300 m radius for debris (under testing) 80 m456a2 heat -t 2 to 5 meters 3000m secondary armor defeat, field fortifications, light armor vehicles, bunker defeat 300 m radius for debris (under testing) 60 m1040 can muzzle . *max range nte 300 meters. optimum range <=100m. structures 250m. troops 550m. wood, troops behin d cinder blocks. c -wire, and technical vehicle barrier. circumference expands exponentially from muzzle. by 300m, spread has expanded to approximately 60m. not recommended for use on structures. it can have a significant impact on a concrete wall, but rou nd of choice should be hep. legend: can = canister hep = high explosive plastic hep-t = high explosive plastic tracer max = maximum m = meter nte = not to exceed a-7. blast effect radius needs to be included in planning considerations. secondary effects of munitions round casing discard, noise, blast radius, shrapnel of target point of impact, and collateral damage. the angle of the mgs to the breach point may extend the blast and debris field and should also be considered. whenever possible a zero degree obliquity to the target breach point is desired. targets cannot exceed more than 80 degree obliquity to the target. (see figure a-1 on page a-3.) breaching using mgs 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 a-3 legend: 5° = variation of aim, 10° = ricochet of round, 25° = explosion of round along gun target line out 300m, area b = explosion at impact point 300m, gtl = gun target line, m = meter figure a-1. safety zones section ii – prepare a-8. preparing involves setting conditions to engage, emplacement of troops, marking the target, and communication between breach element and mgs. it covers the suppress, obscure, and secure steps of sosra. suppress a-9. to prepare for the breach the stryker infantry or another mgs vehicle must suppress the enemy forces long enough to allow the breach team to mark the target. the mgs can be used to suppress the enemy during this process but risks loss of coordination with the breach team; which may cause the breach team having to remark the breach point, or the suppressing effort to last longer. a-10. marking the target includes placing the breach point on the structure with a visual marking to allow the gunner in the mgs vehicle to target a specific point. the breach team should mark the target breach point in respects to its potential collateral damage such as ensuring that the breach point is not part appendix a a-4 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016of a supporting foundation of the structure, has enough distance that gunner can identify, and the round fired from the mgs has time to arm. a-11. communication should be maintained with infantry elements and vehicle crewmembers, constantly. during the marking process the mgs vehicle guides the infantry to ensure they can identify the breach point while the infantry ensure that the point of the breach can meet the intent of the task. obscure a-12. obscuration with smoke grenade salvos from the stryker vehicles or hand held grenades can assist in obscuration. this assists the breach team during the marking process. smoke should be directed towards enemy positions and if possible placed inside the enemy structure if roe permits. smoke should be used in short duration and if possible not obscure the breach point when the breach team and mgs are coordinating. secure a-13. isolating the target building ensures that criteria have been met to conduct the breach. if possible, placing the mgs in a position to limit collateral damage to adjacent buildings and noncombat personnel when executing the breach is optimal. infantry should be placed in an area with proper protection that allows them to conduct the breach quickly but far enough away to ensure they are not compromised by either the effects of the mgs engagement or the enemy. section iii – execute a-14. execution begins reduction step of sosra and ends with the assault. the infantry elements conduct target handoff to the mgs vehicle to reduce the structure by establishing a breaching point . before engaging, the mgs will ensure all personnel are in a safe position. when confirmation is received the mgs vehicle announces it is engaging. reduce a-15. the mgs will fire one round and then make an assessment through its sights as to whether further rounds are needed (based on wall construction type). once the mgs has determined that the breach hole is the appropriate size they will signal the breaching team. upon receiving the signal the breach team begins its movement from its protective posi tion to the breach point. (see figure a-2 on page a-5 .) breaching using mgs 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 a-5 figure a-2. mgs wall breach execution assault a-16. when the breaching team reaches the breach point, they will quickly assess the viability of the breach. this assessment includes: structural support stability, hole size, and need for further improvement. if the breach hole is stable and of the appropriate size the breaching team will continue the mission by entering the breach point. (see figure a-3.) the mgs will shift fires to cover the approach to the breaching point and ingress and egress as appropriate. upon completion of clearing the structure the breaching team makes a more thorough assessment to ensure the structure is not going to collapse. appendix a a-6 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016 figure a-3. infantry enter and clear building 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 glossary-1 glossary the glossary lists acronyms and terms with army or joint definitions. where army and joint definitions differ, (army) precedes the definition. terms for which atp 3-21.11 is the proponent are marked with an asterisk. the proponent manual for other terms is listed in parentheses after the definition. section i – acronyms and abbrevi ations 1sg first sergeant a-22 bags aerial delivery cargo bag, nsn 1670 -00-587-3421 aatf air assault task force amd air and missil e defense ao area of operations atgm antitank guided missile bct brigade combat team bhl battle handover line bp battle position bsb brigade support battalion ca civil affairs cao civil affairs operations casevac casualty evacuation cas close air support cat civil affairs team alpha cbrne chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and h igh-yield explosive cbrn chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear cca close combat attack ccp casualty collection point ci counterintelligence class i food, rations, and water class ii clothing class iii petroleum, oil, and lubricants class iv fortification and barrier materials. class v ammunition class vii major end items class viii medical supplies. cmo civil-military operations coa course of action coist company intelligence support team conops concept of operations cop common operational picture cp command post ea engagement area eod explosive ordnance disposal glossary glossary-2 atp 3-21.11 4 february 2016epw enemy prisoner of war fa field artillery fbcb2 force xxi battle co mmand —brigade and below feba forward edge of the battle area fist fire support team fm frequency modulat ion fo forward observer fpf final protective fires fpl final protective line fs fire support fsf foreign security force fso fire support office r hemtt heavy expanded mobile tactical truck hep high-explosive plastic hep -t high-explosive plastic tracer hn host nation hnsf host-nation security forces hpt high-payoff target hss health services support humint human intelligence hvt high-value target icv infantry carrier vehicle ied improvised explosive device iia inform and influence activities ipb intelligence preparation of the battlefield ir infrared kia killed in action lc line of contact ld line of departure loa limit of advance logpac logistics package lrp logistics release point lz landing zone mba main battle area mel maximum engagement lines mett -tc mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, and civil considerations mgs mobile gun system miclic mine -clearing line charge miso military information support operations nai named area of interest ncoic noncommissioned officer in charge glossary 4 february 2016 atp 3-21.11 glossary-3 nco noncommissioned officer nfa no-fire area oakoc observation and fields of fire, avenues of ap proach, key terrain, obstacles and movement, cover and concealment oic officer in charge oe operational environment opcon operational control opord operation order op observation post opsec operations security pa public affairs pci precombat insepc tion pir priority intelligence requirement pld probable line of deployment psg platoon sergeant pz pickup zone rfl restrictive fire lines roe rules of engagement rto radio/telephone operator rws remote weapon system s-1 battalion or brigade person nel staff officer s-2 battalion or brigade intelligence staff officer s-3 battalion or brigade operations staff officer s-4 battalion logistics staff officer sa situational awareness sbct stryker brigade combat team sbf support by fire se site explo itation sfa security force assistance sof special operations forces sop standard operating procedure sosra suppress, obscure, secure, reduce , and assault tlp troop leading procedure tnt 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (cas number 118 -96-7;
