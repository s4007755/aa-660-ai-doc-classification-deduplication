It describe s the functions of the brigade support battalion (BSB), \nwhich includes a headquarters comp any, a distribution company, a fiel d maintenance company, a brigade \nsupport medical company and forward su pport companies. The BSB is capable of task organizing to support the \nbrigade combat team conducting decisive action operations. \nThe principal audience for ATP 4-90 is commanders and staffs assigned to a brigade support battalion and \nbrigade combat team commanders and staffs. It is also applicable to other operational and sustainment organizations in an operational environment. Trainers  and educators throughout the Army will also use this \npublication. \nCommanders, staffs and subordinates ensure that their decisions and actions comply with applicable United \nStates, international, and, in some cases, host nation laws  and regulations. Commanders at all levels ensure that \ntheir Soldiers operate in accordance w ith the law of war and the rules of engagement. (see Field Manual [FM] \n27-10). \nATP 4-90 uses joint terms where applicable. Selected jo int and Army terms and definitions appear in both the \nglossary and the text. For definitions shown in the text, the term is italicized and the number of the proponent publication follows the definition. This publication is not the proponent for any Army terms. \nATP 4-90 applies to the Active Army, Army National Guard/Army National Guard of the United States, and the \nUnited States Army Reserve unless otherwise noted. Un less this ATP states otherwise, masculine nouns and \npronouns do not refer exclusively to men. \nThe proponent of ATP 4-90 is the United States Army Su stainment Center of Excellence.

ATP 4-90 is a revision of FM 4-90, Brigade Support \nBattalion , last published in 2010 \nThis ATP was written for commanders, staffs and Sold iers assigned to a brigade support battalion, the \nbrigade combat team and the support brigades. It pr ovides relevant information to echelon above brigade \nsustainment organizations. ATP 4-90 provides information on the role and functions of each organization \nwithin the BSB.  \nATP 4-90 clarifies existing BSB doctrine. The intent is to  frame the BSB in the context of its role within its \nsupported brigade as opposed to its role within the sustainment system. This is accomplished by \neliminating discussion about modular logistics and focusing on BSB operations. The updates to ATP 4-90 account for mission command philosophy , emerging Army vision and impl ementation of Global Combat \nSupport System-Army Field/Tactical  (GCSS-Army (F/T). Language and content of the manual are \nconsistent with current doctrine guidelines. This is  primarily accomplished by removing functional details \nfrom the chapters describing the subordinate companies and referring  the reader to the appropriate \nfunctional ATP. Organization graphics are updated with known organizational changes and GCSS-Army (F/T) operations are annotated where appropriate. The aviation support battalion’s role, organization and \noperations are consolidated into a single chapter. All text related to mission command warfighting \nfunctions and log reporting is consolidated into a single chapter which includes an expanded section on mission command systems and command post (CP) opera tions. There are three appe ndices: an echelon of \nsupport appendix, a brigade support area (BSA) ap pendix and a current Stryker brigade combat team \nappendix.  \nATP 4-90 contains eight chapters: \n Chapter 1  includes the role of the BSB, how the BSB supports the sustainment warfighting function \nand decisive action tasks. The chapter also includes BSB concept of support and descriptions of echelon above brigade units that would support th e BSB and the BSB supported brigades.  \n Chapter 2  lists the battalions’ capabilities and BSB headqua rters and staff organization. Of note are \nthe duties of specific staff elements a nd how they integrate with the suppor ted brigade’s staff. There is also \na section on how the BSB fits within its supported br igade. Section four includes the battlefield surveillance \nbrigade’s (BFSB) brigade support compan y role, organization and operations.  \n Chapter 3  provides an overview of th e distribution company and includ es recent capability updates.  \n Chapter 4  is about the field maintenance company.  \n Chapter 5  describes the brigade support medical comp any (BSMC) and includes the BSMC’s role, \norganization graphic and BSMC operations.  \n Chapter 6  provides the role, organization and operations  of the aviation support battalion (ASB). The \nASB is both structured differently an d operates differently from the BSB.  \n Chapter 7  is about the forward support company (FSC). The chapter identifies the role of the FSC, the \nFSC organization and describes what the FSC does. The chapter also includes a discussion of the FSC \ncommander’s role and command relationship between the FSC, the BSB and the supported battalion. \n Chapter 8 is mission command and logistic reporting. The content includes operations process, \ncommand post operations, mission command systems available to accomplish logistic reporting and a section on logistic reporting.  \n \nThis page intentionally left blank .  \n \n \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 1-1 Chapter 1 \nRole of the Brigade Support Battalion (BSB) \nThe brigade combat team (BCT) and support brigades provide commanders with \nready and relevant warfighting capabilities th at are mission-tailored and scalable. The \nBSBs provide capabilities that can be task or ganized to support decisive action tasks. \nThis chapter provides an overview of the BSB role and describes how the BSB \nsupports its supported brigades. Organizati ons without a BSB will be supported by a \nsustainment brigade. \nSECTION I – BSB ROLE \n1-1. Brigade combat teams are the prim ary combined arms force that ex ecutes decisive actions for the \nArmy. Brigade combat teams provide the land component or joint task force commander with unique \ncapabilities in support of unified land operations. There are three standard types of BCTs—the armored brigade combat teams (ABCT), the in fantry brigade combat team (IBCT),  and the Stryker brigade combat \nteam (SBCT). All six warfighting functions; mission command, movement and maneuver, intelligence, \nfires, sustainment, and protection, are organic to a brigade combat team. Support brigades reinforce the \nBCT with the following capabilities; sustainment, engineer, intelligence, protection, and aviation. \n1-2. The BSB’s role is to support the supported brigade’s execution of operations by providing logistic \nsupport. The BSB commander must understand the supported commander’s plan and then execute support \nso the supported brigade maintains freedom of action and maneuver. Synchronizing current and future \nsupport requirements with the supported brigade are th e hallmarks of successful support. Tactical logistics \nand Army Health System (AHS) support must be inte grated into the brigade’s concept of operations.  \n1-3. The BSB commander mission commands all organic BSB capabilities in support of BCT priorities. \nThe forward support compan ies (FSCs) extend the operational reach of the BSB into the maneuver area and \nare critical to the success of the logi stic concept of support. BSBs pe rform similar roles in support of \nbrigades however; the capabilities of a BSB vary by design. Area support  is the method of logistics, \nmedical support, and personnel services in wh ich support relationships are determined by the \nlocation of the units requiring support. Sustainmen t units provide support to units located in or \npassing through their assigned areas.  The BSB provides area support on an exception basis when they \nhave the capability and capacity to do so. \nSECTION II – SUPPORT TO DECISIVE ACTION \n1-4. The BSB supports offensive, defensive, stability and Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) \ntasks. BSB operations are accomplished by planning and executing missions within the context of the sustainment warfighting function and by applying the principles of sustainment when executing the support \nof decisive action tasks. The sustainment warfighting function  is the related tasks and systems that provide \nsupport and services to ensure freedom of action, extend operational reach, and prolong endurance (Army \ndoctrine reference publication [ADRP]  3-0). Successfully integrating th e sustainment warfighting function \ninto the concept of operations enables freedom of action, extended operational reach and prolonged endurance. \n1-5. Operational reach is the distance and duration across which a unit can successfully employ military \ncapabilities. The BSB enables operationa l reach by task organizing FS Cs with required capabilities to \nprolong the endurance of brigade operations while ma intaining sufficient support to ensure freedom of \naction. Endurance stems from the ability to maintain, protect, and sustain forces, regardless of how far \nChapter 1  \n1-2 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 away they are deployed, how austere the environment, or how long decisive tasks are continued. The BSB \nenables endurance ensuring a continuous flow of sustainment to its supported brigade.  \n1-6. The objective of sustainment in offensive tasks is to provide sufficient support to enable the BCT to \nconduct the four primary offensive tasks:  movement to contact, attack, exploitation and pursuit employing the six forms of maneuver: envelopment, turning move ment, frontal attack penetration, infiltration, and \nflank attack. Sustainment of offens ive tasks involves providing support to widely dispersed forces along \nextended lines of communication. Sustainment support to offensive tasks is focused on rearming, refueling, casualty evacuation and maintenance support. The follo wing tasks are common in support of sustainment \nplanning for offensive operations: \n Plan and conduct recovery operations. \n Position sustainment forward to reduce resupply and maintenance support requirements. \n Plan and conduct airdrop operations.  \n Plan and conduct casualty evacuation operations.  \n Consider establishing aerial resu pply and forward logistics bases. \n1-7. The objective of sustainment in defensive tasks is to provide sufficient support to enable the BCT to \nconduct the three primary defe nsive tasks: area defense, mobile defense and retrograde. Area defense  is a \ndefensive task that concentrates on denying enemy forces access to designated terrain for a specific time \nrather than destroying the enemy (ADRP 3-90). The mobile defense  concentrates on destruction or defeat of \nthe enemy through a deci sive attack by a striking force (ADRP 3-90). Retrograde  involves organized \nmovement away from the enemy (ADRP 3-90). Sustai nment support of defensive tasks is focused on \nrearming, counter mobility and casualty evacuation. Cons ider the following points for defensive operations \nsustainment planning: \n Locate BSB and support points where they can best fulfill support tasks while using minimal \nresources to maintain security. \n Plan and conduct casualty evacuation operations. \n1-8. The sustainment of stability tasks often involves supporting U.S. and multinational forces in a wide \nrange of missions. It can be conducted in support of a host nation or interim government or as part of an \noccupation when no governments exist. Stability tasks range from long-term humanitarian and civic assistance missions to major short notice peace enfo rcement. Some stability ta sks may involve combat. \nTailoring supplies, personnel and equipment to the specific needs of the operation is essential.  \n1-9. Sustainment for stability tasks is unique and more complex due to physically dispersed unit \nlocations, lack of adequate infrastructure, nontrad itional demands by civil military operations, and the \nburden caused by displaced civilians. Leaders mu st understand all the mission variables and remain \nflexible. Stability operations are generally fluid envi ronments for support Soldiers and can result in \nconfusion if leaders are not operationally aware of support agreements. \n1-10. Host-nation support, operational contract support,  and local purchases are force multipliers during \nthe execution of many decisive action tasks. Situations that lack optimal sustaining capabilities may require \nusing nonstandard logistics. They may augment or replace existing logistics capability. Nonstandard \nlogistics can reduce dependence on the logistic system, improve response time and free airlift and sealift for other priority needs. Contingency contracting personnel should precede the main body of Army forces, if \nfeasible. Nonstandard logistics may be employed for: \n Limited supplies such as classes I, II, III, IV, VII, and IX. \n Services such as catering, maintenanc e and repair, sanitation, and laundry. \n Transportation. \n1-11. Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) is genera lly used in cases of domestic emergencies, for \ndesignated law enforcement support, and other activities upon request for assistance from civil authorities. \nCivil support includes operations that address the consequences of natural or man-made disasters, \naccidents, terrorist attacks, and inci dents in the United States and its te rritories. Army forces conduct civil \nsupport operations when civil authorities request assistance and the Secretary of Defense concurs. In \nDefense Support of Civil Authorities, military forces al ways play a supporting role . State and federal laws \ndefine how military forces can support civil authoritie s. Often, a state's National Guard forces, acting in \nRole of the Brigade Support Battalion (BSB)  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 1-3 their state capacities under Title 32 of the Unites States Code, are enough to provide an adequate response \nto a situation. However, when these forces are not enough, Governors may request additional support from \nfederal authorities. For more information see Department of Defense Directive 3025.18 and Army doctrine \npublication (ADP) 3-28, Defense Support of Civil Authorities.  \nCONCEPT OF SUPPORT \n1-12. The BSB plans, coordinates, synchronizes, and executes replenishment operations in support of \nbrigade operations. It distributes supply  classes I, II, III, IV, V, VII, VIII and IX; provides food service; and \nRoles 1 and 2 AHS support, as well as field mainte nance and recovery. It maintains visibility of the \ndistribution network within their area of operations, sy nchronizing the flow of throughput into the brigade’s \noperational area. Sustainment leaders use operational variables, political, military, economic, social, \ninformation, infrastructure, physical  environment, and time and mission variables, mission, enemy, terrain \nand weather, troops and support availa ble, time available and civil cons iderations (METT–TC), to assess \nsituations and make decisions. \n1-13. Although BSB capabilities and structure differ somewhat depending upon the type of BCT, all are \ndesigned to provide direct support to its supported br igade. BSBs provide responsive support to the brigade \nby positioning FSCs with maneuver, cavalry, fires and engineer battalions. The type of support may vary \nby battalion based upon the situation and support requirements. \n1-14. BSBs provide distribution platforms that enable the brigades to c onduct sustained operations for a \nfinite period of time. BSBs plan and execute replenishment operations in support of maneuver force battles \nand engagements. Replenishment operations are delib erate, time-sensitive operations conducted to \nreplenish forward support companies with essential supplies, such as class III(B) and class V. The \nsustainment brigade can provide logistics capability that is not organic to the BSB, such as water \npurification and bulk fuel, or provide additional capacity , such as additional transportation, to support the \nBSB. \n1-15. Army logistics enables the commander to execute his mission and sustain the force, throughout the \nrange of Army operations. Logistics forces are flexible and may be employed in nonstandard tasks. Like all other elements, they must be capable of self-defense, particularly if they deploy alone or in advance of \nother Army forces.  \n1-16. The support concept for the BCT is based on a number of facts and assumptions used in the military \ndecision making process (MDMP). The BSB support operations officer (SPO) coordinates with the support \noperations staff of the sustainment brigade and/or the combat sustainment support battalions (CSSB) \ndesignated for support. Coordination may include ammunition support, designated field services, bulk fuel \nsupport, water purification, general supply support, tran sportation, and mortuary affairs support. In addition \nto the daily logistics support operations that the BS B performs, the BSB may be on-call to provide a range \nof logistical sustainment in support of personn el recovery operations or detainee operations. \n1-17. Command relationships of supporting organizations must be clearly defined during the planning \nprocess. When the BCT receives capa bility attached from the support brigades , such as the fires brigade, \nthe BSB SPO must understand the task organization and the command relationship. The SPO coordinates \nwith supporting organizations on what organic support  they are bringing with them. The SPO will array \nthose capabilities on the battlefield so that they are integrated with the BSB capabilities. Logistics planners require some basic information from the parent unit’ s battalion logistics staff officer (S-4) to develop a \nsynchronized concept of support. Some considerations are: \n Number and type of personnel and equipment. \n Supply consumption history. \n When attachment is effective and for how long. \n The support assets that will accompany the attached element. \n When and where replenishment operations will occu r, and which individual or unit has primary \nresponsibility for planning and coordinating this action. \n1-18. Units deploy with a pre-determined amount of supplies on hand. Sustainment stocks continue to flow \nduring the initial, early entry buildup. Support re quirements change rapidly as does the operational \nChapter 1  \n1-4 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 environment. The BSB focus is on distribution operations, getting the right stuff to the right place at the \nright time in support of the BCT operations. \n1-19. There are often host nation and theater support cont racts in place for transpor tation, life support, and \nfacilities support as necessary. When the situati on warrants, Logistics Civil Augmentation Program \n(LOGCAP) may be used to meet internal support requirements. LOGCAP is coordinated through the \nsustainment brigade and the Army Fi eld Support Brigade. In either co ntract support option, the BSB may \nbe called upon to provide contracting officer representatives for contracted logistic services being executed in the supported BCT’s area of operation. \nOPERATIONAL ENERGY  \n1-20. Brigade support battalions will cons ider operational energy in the planning and executing of their \nmissions. Operational energy is the sum of energy and associated systems, information and processes \nrequired to train, move, and sustain forces and systems for military operations. The BSB must consider \nways to conserve or reduce the amount of operatio nal energy resources used in military operations. \nThrough conservation of energy resources, commanders can reduce resupply operations, increase vehicle \nand equipment efficiency, and reduce environmental damage. A continuous process, commanders must \nplan and oversee operations to reduce consumption, use alternative energy means, a nd incorporate the latest \nenergy saving technologies. Employing a combination of best practices, technologies, and discipline in \nmanaging and executing supply and field services operations will extend op erational reach and reduce \nmission risk.  \nSUPPORT METHODS  \n1-21. Logistics operations can be tailored in response to changes in tactical requirements. BSB support \noperations are fully integrated with the brigade battle rhythm through planning and oversight of on-going \noperations. Logistical synchronization matrices and logistics reports are used to initiate and maintain synchronization between operations and logistics functions. \n1-22. Supported unit commanders coordinate through their battalion operations staff officer (S-3) and S-4 \nstaffs to decide the time and place fo r replenishment operations at a temporarily established point. Assets \ncan be re-tasked if the situation demands. This centralized approach optimizes the employment of \npersonnel. Designated distribution managers such as unit supply sergeants or first sergeants, coordinate and \nsynchronize logistics flow per the commander’s prior ities using all logistics information systems available \nin order to maximize support to units.  \nUnit (Battalion/Company/Platoon) Distribution \n1-23. In unit distribution, supplies are configured in unit sets (battalion/company/platoon, depending on the \nlevel of distribution) and delivered to one or more central locations. This technique makes maximum use of \nthe capacity of BCT truck assets by minimizing delivery and turnaround time.  \nSupply Point Distribution \n1-24. Supply point distribution requires unit representatives to move to a supply point to pick up their \nsupplies. Supply point distribution is most commonly executed by means of a logistics release point. The \nlogistics release point may be any place on the ground where unit vehicles  return to pick  up supplies and \nthen take them forward to their unit. Occasionally, the logistics release point is the brigade support area \n(BSA). A BSA is a designated area in which sustain ment elements locate to provide support to a \nbrigade .  \nRefuel On The Move \n1-25. The doctrinal purpose of refuel on the move is to  extend the time that grou nd maneuver forces can \nspend on the objective. Refuel on the move is most often used to support extended moves to or from a tactical assembly area before an attack or before a retrograde move. Supported unit S-3 and S-4 staffs \ncoordinate with the BCT S-4 and BSB SPO to fix th e time and place to conduct the refuel on the move \nRole of the Brigade Support Battalion (BSB)  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 1-5 operations according to unit battle rhythm. When vehicles enter a refuel on the move site for refueling, they \nreceive a predetermined amount of fuel (usually timed)  and they move out to re turn to their convoy or \nformation. FM 10-67-1, Concepts and Equipment of Petroleum Operations,  contains more information \nabout refuel on the move operations. \nAerial Resupply (Fixed-Wing and Rotary Wing) \n1-26. Aerial delivery distribution provides an effective means of conducting distribution operations. In \norder for aerial delivery to be ef fective, friendly forces must cont rol airspace throughout the area of \noperations (AO) and enemy ground-based air defenses must  be neutralized. It is used for routine and urgent \nresupply to units in various locations where terrain limits access. Aerial delivery acts as a combat multiplier \nbecause it is an effective means of by-passing enemy activities and reduces the n eed for route clearance of \nground lines of communications. Aerial delivery includes airdrop, airland, and sling-load operations. It is a \nvital link in supporting remo te or forward locations. \nImmediate Resupply \n1-27. Immediate resupply, also referred to as emergency resupply, is the least preferred method of \ndistribution of supplies. While some may be required when combat losses occur,  requests for immediate \nresupply not related to combat loss indicates a brea kdown in coordination and collaboration between the \nlogistician and customer. If imme diate resupply is necessary, all pos sible means, including options not \ncovered above, may be used. The battalion/squadron S-4s, the BCT S-4, and the BSB SPO must constantly \nand thoroughly collaborate to minimize this need. Emergency resupply that extends beyond BSB capabilities requires immediate intervention of the next higher command capable of executing the mission. \nIn such case, the BCT S-4 and BSB SPO immediately coordinate with the next higher echelon of support \nfor the BCT. \nCONTRACT SUPPORT  \n1-28. There are three types of contract ed support available to  support an operational commander: theater \nsupport, systems support, and exte rnal support. Theater support cont racts are contracts awarded by \ncontingency contracting officers deployed to the opera tional area that provide the ability to rapidly contract \nfor logistics support within a theater of operations. Systems support contracts are prearranged contracts \nawarded and funded by acquisition program executive officers and project/product management officers. \nThese contracts provide technical supp ort, maintenance support and, in some cases, class IX support for a \nvariety of non-type classified and selected Army weapon and support systems.  \n1-29. External support contracts are contracts awarded by contracting organizations whose contracting \nauthority does not derive directly from the theater su pport contracting head(s) of contracting activity or \nfrom systems support contracting authorities. External support service contracts provide a variety of \nlogistic and other non-combat related services and supply support. The largest and most commonly known \nexternal support contract is the Army’s LOGCAP. LOGCAP may provide supply services (e.g. storage, \nwarehousing, or distribution) for the nine classe s of supplies, but the se rvices source the actual \ncommodities. See Army tactics, t echniques publication (ATTP) 4-10, Operational Contract Support \nTactics, Techniques, and Procedures,  and Army Regulation (AR) 700-137, Logistics Civil Augmentation \nProgram , for additional information. \n1-30. Commanders can expect that contractors will be involved in operations. The management and control \nof contractors differs from the mission command of Sold iers and Department of the Army civilians. During \nmilitary operations, Soldiers and Army civilians are under the control of the military chain of command. \nCommanders can direct Soldier and Army civilian task assignment, special recognition, and disciplinary action. However, they do not have the same contro l over contractors. The terms and conditions of the \ncontract establish relationships between the military and the contractor. Commanders and staff planners \nmust assess the need for prov iding operational area security to a cont ractor and designate forces to provide \nsecurity when appropriate. The missi on of, threat to, and location of the contractor determines the degree of \nprotection needed. \nChapter 1  \n1-6 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 1-31. Interface for operational contract support will be done by the supporting sustainment brigade. \nExceptions would be designated Field Ordering Officers who draw their purchasing authority from the \nsupporting Contingency Contracting Element servicing the brigade area. \n1-32. When coordinated, the Defense Logistics Agency throughputs bulk fuel, water, and food to units \nassigned to a brigade. This may be done either through pre-positioned stocks or defense logistics agency \ntheater support contracts (e.g., into-p lane contracts, into-bag contracts, into-truck contracts) after sources \nare inspected and approved by veterinary and preventive medicine personnel. \nECHELON ABOVE BRIGADE SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS \n1-33. All sustainment requirements (less medical) beyond  the BSB’s ability are coordinated through the \nsupporting sustainment brigade. The sustainment brigade supports the BCT on an area basis either in a \ngeneral support or direct support role, which is determined by the theater concept of support plan. The \nsustainment brigade provides support to BCTs and support brigades for capability not organic to the BSB. \nThese capabilities include transportation support, fuel storage, water production, field service support and \ncontingency contracting. \nSUSTAINMENT BRIGADE  \n1-34. The sustainment brigade is task-organized based on mission. All sustainmen t brigade headquarters \n(HQ) are identical in organizational structure and capabilities. The building blocks of the sustainment \nbrigade are CSSBs and/or functional logistics battali ons. Sustainment brigades are subordinate to the \ntheater sustainment command/expeditionary sustainment command and are task organized to provide \nsupport in an assigned area of operations. Some of the logistics units which may be assigned to the \nsustainment brigade are discusse d below. Refer to ATP 4-93, Sustainment Brigade , for more details on the \nsustainment brigade.  \nCombat Sustainment Support Battalions (CSSB) \n1-35. The combat sustainment support battalion is task or ganized to provide logistics support to brigade \ncombat teams and support brigades. ATP 4-93, Sustainment Brigade , has more information about the \nCSSBs. The combat sustainment support battalion provides the following capabilities in support of the \nbrigade combat teams and support brigades: \n Ammunition lift platoons or modular ammunition companies assigned to the CSSB operate an \nammunition supply area or point which prov ides for the receipt, storage, issue, and \nreconfiguration of ammunition items. \n Transportation elements provide mobility of personnel and distribution of all classes of supplies. \nAt the tactical level, the combat sustainment support battalion’s transportation assets provide \ndistribution capacity from the CSSB support area to the brigade support battalion.  \n A multi-capable supply company provides water purification and bulk fuel storage, capabilities \nno longer available within the BSB.   \n CSSB support maintenance companies may be requested to provide support for certain low-\ndensity commodities such as communications, electronics, and armament.  \n Supply and services assets of the CSSB provide all classes of supplies and field service \noperations for personnel assigned to or transiting through the AO. Field services include clothing \nexchange, laundry and shower support, rigger units, and mortuary affairs support.  \nBSB Coordination For Echelon Above Brigade Support \n1-36. When the supported brigade’s support requirements exceed BSB capability, immediate coordination \nbetween the BSB commander and staff, BCT commander and staff, and the supporting sustainment brigade \nmust occur. The BSB may require additional capability because th ey lack organic f unctions of water \npurification, non-mobile bulk petroleum storage, fiel d services or increased distribution capability. The \nadditional capability could be required due to an incr ease in population, scope of mission, or equipment \ndensity as a result of extensive BCT task organization.  \nRole of the Brigade Support Battalion (BSB)  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 1-7 1-37. The BSB commander, SPO, S-3, and subordinate companies must constantly monitor the support \nrequirements of the supported brigade and immediat ely notify the BSB commander if a capability shortfall \nexists. Conversely, the BCT commander, BCT staff, and the supported battalion commanders must \nconstantly assess their support requirements and communicate shortfa lls to the BSB.   \n1-38. Once a capability shortfall is identified, the BSB commander and staff must analyze it and determine \nif the shortfall can be corrected internally before re questing echelon above brigad e support. The outcome of \nthe analysis and a recommended course of action is coordinated with the BCT commander, BCT staff, and \nbattalion commanders to ensure complete understanding of the course of action and consensus. The BSB \ncommander also recommends the type of command or support relationship the echelon above brigade \nelement has with the supported brigade. Although echelon above brigade support units have a general support relationship to the BCT and support brig ades, a direct support relationship or a command \nrelationship such as operational control (OPCON) or tactical control may be appropriate.  \n1-39. The BSB SPO normally coordinates directly w ith the supporting sustainment brigade SPO. \nCoordination for additional capability may also be  conducted through command channels. The BSB SPO \nidentifies the requirements: type, scope, and projected duration of support required and the sustainment brigade determines how they will provide support.   \n1-40. The supporting sustainment brigade tasks a CSSB to provide the support. The supporting CSSB SPO \ncoordinates with the BSB SPO to integrate the echelon above brigade capability into the concept of support \nand to synchronize support operations. The BSB SPO will array additional capabilities on the battlefield so \nthat they are integrated with the BSB capabilities. The BSB must ensure all supporting and supported units \nhave a complete understanding of the additional capab ility, support requirements, and the established \nsupport or command relationship.   \n1-41. As the mission changes, support requirements, support/command relationships and the supported \nunits priority of support also changes. Supported and supporting units must continually assess support requirements and balance them against priority of support and available capability to ensure the most \neffective use of sustainment resources. \nMOVEMENT CONTROL TEAM (MCT) \n1-42. The movement control team is a modular transportation organization which commits allocated \ntransportation assets, regulates movement on theater controlled main supply routes (MSR) and alternate \nsupply routes, and provides transportation services in a theater of operation. Movement control teams are \nsubordinate elements of the movement control battalio n and are positioned throughout the theater to assist \nin the decentralized execution of movement control responsibilities. Movement control teams are the entry \npoint for joint and Army forces to request Army common user transportation assets when movement requirements exceed an organization’s or ganic transportation capability. ATP 4-16, Movement Control , \ndescribes roles, responsibilities, and command relationships for organizations planning, executing, and \nsupporting Army movement control. \nBRIGADE LOGISTICS SUPPORT TEAM \n1-43. The brigade logistics support team is a deployable organization made up of both military and \nDepartment of the Army civilians that normally operates in direct support of a BCT or combat aviation \nbrigade (CAB) or brigade level unit, and provides limited general support to other units on an area basis as directed. The brigade logistics suppo rt team is the primary interface w ith between the BCT and/or the CAB \nand the U. S. Army Materiel Command regarding sustainment maintenance and related acquisition, \nlogistics and technology support. The brigade logistic s support team’s team chief acts as U. S. Army \nMateriel Command’s advisor to the supported brigade commander and is responsible to coordinate all U. S. \nArmy Materiel Command and related acquisition, logistics and technology support with the supported unit \ncommand and staff. The brigade logistics support team’s  chief coordinates day-to-day activities through the \nBSB SPO.  \n1-44. Brigade logistics support teams normally deploy with their supported brigade. When deployed, \nbrigade logistics support teams are us ually attached to an Army field su pport battalion and receive logistics, \nfacility and security support from th eir supported brigade. In this role , the brigade logistics support team \nChapter 1  \n1-8 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 consists of various life cycle command logistic assist ance representatives who advise the supported brigade \nand BSB commanders regarding U. S. Army Materiel Command sustainment maintenance capabilities. The \nbrigade logistics support team also provides mainte nance advice and assistance to the field maintenance \ncompany mechanics as coordinated th rough the BSB SPO and facilitates reach  back to U. S. Army Materiel \nCommand through its parent Army field support battalion and Army field support brigade. Refer to ATP 4-\n91, Army Field Support Brigade , for more information.  \nECHELONS ABOVE BRIGADE SUPPORT FOR MEDICAL AND CLASS VIII \n1-45. Army Health System support beyond the BCT brigade support medical company (BSMC) \ncapabilities are provided by echelon above brigade medical units. \nOTHER SUPPORTING UNITS \n1-46. Other organizations that routinely support BSB logistics operations are aviation units, engineers and \nmilitary police. Aviation assets could be used for cargo distribution as part of the distribution plan and for \nconvoy security. Engineers assist distribution tasks th rough route clearance and site construction. Military \npolice can provide additional security  when necessary and are the force responsible for detainee operations. \nAREA SUPPORT RESPONSIBILITIES \n1-47. The BSB is organic to the BCT and was designed with enough capacity to support the BCT. If the \nBCT deploys with a division, echelon above brigade units operating in the BCT AO obtain support from \nthe sustainment brigade or logistics task force employ ed in the division’s AO. Ar my Special Forces units \nare an example of a unit that may opera te or transit through the area but not in direct support of the brigade. \nSpecial Forces units have some organic support cap abilities but are reliant upon regional or combatant \ncommand theater of operations infrastructure. ATP 3-05.40, Special Operations Sustainment , provides \nmore details on special operations sustainment. \n1-48. When the BCT task force is directly supported by a corps or theater asset, the SPO coordinates with \nsupporting organizations on what support they ar e bringing with them. The SPO will array those \ncapabilities on the battlefield so that they are integr ated with the BSB capabilities. In all cases, echelon \nabove brigade units receive AHS sup port in an emergency from the near est AHS support medical treatment \nfacility with the capability to treat the category of emergency of the casualty/patient regardless of unit \naffiliation. \nSECTION III – SUPPORTED ORGANIZATIONS \n1-49. The BSB is designed to support brigade combat teams, and support brigades.  Each BCT and support \nbrigade has a BSB designed to sustain the supported brigade.  This section describes each supported \nbrigade, and organization design. \nBRIGADE COMBAT TEAMS (BCT) \n1-50. Infantry, armored and Stryker brigade combat te ams comprise the Army’s  combat power building \nblocks. Brigade combat teams often operate as part of a division. The division acts as a tactical headquarters that can control up to five BCTs in high- or mid-intensity combat operations, plus a number of \nsupporting functional brigades. The division assigns the brigade combat team its mission, AO, and \nsupporting elements, and coordinates its actions with other brigade combat teams of the formation. The brigade combat team may be required  to detach subordinate elements to other BCTs of the division. In its \nprincipal role as a combined arms maneuver unit, the BCT closes with and destroys the enemy by \ncombining reconnaissance, surveillance, target acquis ition, long range fires, maneuver, and the support of \njoint forces and other Army units. It uses every available military and interagency means to gain \ninformation superiority, and to ensure understanding of every aspect of the terrain , weather, enemy, civil \nconcerns, and friendly forces prior to and during execution. \nRole of the Brigade Support Battalion (BSB)  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 1-9 INFANTRY BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM (IBCT) \n1-51. The IBCT conducts offensive, defensive, and stability  operations. The IBCT’s core role is to close \nwith the enemy by means of fire and maneuver to destroy or capture enem y forces, or to repel their attacks \nby fire, close combat, and counterattack. The IBCT co nsists of three infantry battalions; reconnaissance, \nsurveillance, target acquisition; fires battalion; the br igade engineer battalion and brigade support battalion.  \n1-52. The IBCT provides specialized capabilities as an independent maneuver force or as a subordinate \nmaneuver component to division or corps in major comb at operations. In a smaller-scale contingency, the \nIBCT provides a corps or joint ta sk force a combat team that depl oys rapidly, executes forced entry \noperations, and conducts offensive operations immediately upon arrival to prevent, contain, stabilize or \nresolve a conflict, or to promote peace. For more  information on the IBCT and its operations and \nsubordinate unit capabilities. Figure 1-1 shows the units that make up the IBCT. \nFigure 1-1. Infantry brigade combat team  \n1-53. The IBCT BSB contains a headquarters and headqu arters company, a distribution company, a field \nmaintenance company, a medical co mpany and six FSCs: identical FSC s support each infantry battalion \none FSC supports an armored reconnaissance squadron, one FSC supports the fires battalion and one FSC \nsupports the brigade engineer battalion.  \nARMORED BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM (ABCT) \n1-54. ABCTs are designed to conduct offensive, defensive,  and stability operations. Their core role is to \nclose with the enemy by means of fire and maneuver to  destroy or capture enemy forces, or to repel their \nattacks by fire, close combat, and counterattack. The ABCT provides significant capabilities as a \nsubordinate maneuver component to division or corps commanders. The ABCT includes three combined arms battalions, a reconnaissance squadron, a fires ba ttalion, a brigade engin eer battalion and brigade \nsupport battalion. For more information on the ABCT and its operations and subordinate unit capabilities. \nFigure 1-2 on page 1-10 shows how the ABCT is organized. \n\nChapter 1  \n1-10 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 Figure 1-2. Armored brigade combat team \n1-55. The ABCT BSB contains a headquarters and headqu arters company, a distri bution company, a field \nmaintenance company, a medical company and six fo rward support companies: identical FSCs support \neach combined arms battalion, one forward supp ort company supports an armored reconnaissance \nsquadron, one forward support company supports the fires battalion and one forward support company \nsupports the brigade engineer battalion. \nSTRYKER BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM (SBCT) \n1-56. The SBCT is an early entry force, designed fo r rapid deployment and to conduct small scale \ncontingencies. The Stryker brigade combat team is ideally suited for early entr y operations where support \ninfrastructure is limited or absent but where a relativ ely powerful, lethal, and flexible combat force is \nrequired. The SBCT consists of three Stryker infantry  battalions; a reconnaissance, surveillance, and target \nacquisition squadron; a field artillery battalion; a brigad e engineer battalion, a brigade support battalion; an \nantitank company; a network support company; a military intelligence company; and a brigade \nheadquarters and headquarters comp any (HHC). The Stryker brigade comb at team is designed to allow \nincreased capabilities through scalability. For more information on the SBCT and its operations and \nsubordinate unit capabilities . Figure 1-3 shows how the Stryker brigade combat team is organized. \nFigure 1-3. Stryker brigade combat team \n1-57. The Stryker BSB contains a headquarters and headqu arters company, a distri bution company, a field \nmaintenance company, a medical company and six fo rward support companies: identical FSCs support \neach Stryker battalion, one forward su pport company supp orts a reconnaissance, su rveillance, and target \nacquisition squadron, one forward support company supports the fires battalion and one forward support company supports the brigade engineer battalion. \n\nRole of the Brigade Support Battalion (BSB)  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 1-11 SUPPORT BRIGADES \n1-58. A mix of multifunctional support brigades suppor t theater army, corps, and division commanders. \nThese supporting brigades includ e the fires brigade, maneuver enhancement brigade (MEB), combat \naviation brigade (CAB), battlefield surveillance brigade (BFSB), and sustainment brigade. These brigades \nare task organized to support BCTs and carry out sp ecific tasks in support of  echelons above BCT. A \ndivision involved in major combat operations should be supported by all five types of support brigades. \n1-59. Most support brigades are not fixed organizations. All support brigades excep t the CAB are designed \naround a base of organic elements, to which a mix of additional capabilities is added based on the factors of \nMETT-TC. The brigade headquarters includes the necessary expertise to control many different \ncapabilities. Each type of support brigade’s base includes organic signal and sustainment capabilities. \nFIRES BRIGADE  \n1-60. A fires brigade’s primary task is to conduct strike operations. The fires brigade is the only Army field \nartillery organization above the brigade combat team and can be directed to execute tasks for any joint, \nservice, or functional HQ. The fires brigade is neither organic to any Army organization or echelon, nor is \nit focused on any specific region or geographic combatant commander’s area of responsibility. The fires brigade is normally attach ed to a division HQ. Organic fires brig ade assets include a rocket/missile \nbattalion equipped with either the M270A1 track multiple launch rocket system or the M142 wheel high-\nmobility artillery rocket system. The fires brigade al so includes a BSB, headquarters and headquarters \nbattery, a signal network support company, and a target acquisition battery. Refer to ATP 3-09.24, \nTechniques for the  Fires Brigade , for more information about the fires br igade. Figure 1-4 is an example of \na type of fires brigade. \nFigure 1-4. Fires brigade \n1-61. A BSB in a fires brigade provides support to the brigade by providing and/or coordinating classes I, \nII, III, IV, V, VII, and IX supplies, Role 1 AHS support, limited field maintenance and limited \ntransportation support. The BSB operates an ammunitio n transfer holding point (ATHP) in the BSA, and \nplans and coordinates for mortuary affairs support. Th e fires brigade BSB contai ns an HHC, a distribution \ncompany, and a field maintenance co mpany. It does not contain a medical company. One FSC is organic to \nthe fires brigade and the other fires FSC are attached. All fires FSC are designed to support the particular \ntype of field artillery battalion of which the brigade is  comprised (i.e., Paladin, multiple launch rocket \nsystem, towed).  \n\nChapter 1  \n1-12 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 MANEUVER ENHANCEMENT BRIGADE (MEB) \n1-62. The MEB provides task organized forces in support of Army division, echelon above division, joint, \ninteragency, or multinational headquarters. The mane uver enhancement brigade operates across all unified \nland operations to support, reinforce or complement  offensive and defensive major combat operations and \ncan support or conduct stability or defense support to civil authorities operations. The MEB is designed as a headquarters capable of conducting mission command warfighting function tasks with a multifunctional \nbrigade staff that is optimized to conduct maneuver support operations. The maneuver enhancement \nbrigade is not a maneuver brigade alth ough it can be assigned an AO and control terrain. The MEB receives \nand mission commands forces to conduct operations. Maneuver enhancement brigades provide capabilities \nto enhance freedom of movement and maneuver for operational and tactical commanders. Refer to FM 3-\n90.31, Maneuver Enhancement Brigade Operations . \n1-63. Beyond its three organic units; h eadquarters and headquarters comp any, network support company, \nand brigade support battalion, the MEB has no fixed structure. The MEB will require tailoring or task organization for every mission that it performs. The or ganization is tailored to respond to the factors of \nMETT-TC. An MEB typically includes a mix of severa l types of battalions and separate companies which \nmay include civil affairs; chemi cal, biological, radiologi cal, and nuclear (CBRN); engineer; explosive \nordnance disposal; and military police units. It may also contain military intelligence assets, tactical combat \nforce, and air and missile defense units. Figure 1-5 is a possible MEB task organization. \nFigure 1-5. Maneuver enhancement brigade \n1-64. The MEB BSB provides support to the MEB by providing and/or coordinating classes I, II, III, IV, \nV, VII, and IX supplies, field maintenance, and lim ited transportation support. It also coordinates for \nadditional transportation needs identified by the br igade. The BSB of the MEB contains an HHC, a \ndistribution company and a field main tenance company. It does not co ntain FSCs or a medical company. \nHowever, it does have organic Role 1 AHS support with the brigade surgeon section and the medical \ntreatment team. \n \n\n \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 2-1 Chapter 2 \nBSB Capabilities and Organization \nThe BSB, in all of its various designs, is capable of supporting decisive action tasks. \nChapter two describes the mission and function of the command group and coordinating staff. This chapter also hi ghlights the different BSB structures. The \nbattlefield surveillance brigade’s brigad e support company is also described. \nSECTION I ‒ CAPABILITIES \n2-1. The BSB provides direct support to a brigade combat team or a fires, maneuver enhancement, or \nbattlefield surveillance brigade. Brigade support batta lion capabilities differ depending on the unit they are \ndesigned to support. Most BSBs have the capability to operate a supply storage activity, operate an \nammunition transfer holding point, conduct field maintenance support, perform distribution operations and provide some AHS support. Brigade support battalions  that contain a medical company provide Role 2 \nmedical care including behavioral hea lth support to all units within the brigade. Brigade support battalions \nwith forward support companies provide distribution, field feeding and field maintenance support to \nsupported battalions. Other capabilities include: \n Field maintenance support to the BSB and the brigade headquarters. The FSCs provide this \nsupport to their respective supported battalion.  \n Field feeding support to the BSB headquarters company, distribution company, field \nmaintenance company, and medical company. \n2-2. The sustainment brigade can provide a specific logistics capability that is not organic to the BSB or \nprovide additional capacity to support the BSB. In the event that a CSSB is required to provide replenishment support to a BCT, it may be task organized with a composite truck company and a multi-\ncapable supply company capable of providing water purification and bulk fuel storage. These capabilities \nare no longer available within the BSB and are centralized w ithin CSSBs. Coordination with the \nsustainment brigade is critical to ensure this support is in place. For additional information about the \nsustainment brigade and CSSB capabilities see ATP 4-93, Sustainment Brigade . \nSECTION II ‒ BSB HEADQUARTERS ORGANIZATION \n2-3. The BSB headquarters consists of the command group, coordinating staff and headquarters company. \nThe BSB provides mission command for all organic and attached units of the brigade support battalion. It \nalso provides administrative and logistics support to units organic or assigned to the BSB. The staff \nconducts planning, provides direction, and oversees l ogistics operations for all assigned and attached units \nin the brigade combat team. The BSB can also execute mission command for all units in the BSA for \nsecurity and terrain management.  \n2-4. The BSB headquarters company is responsible for th e Soldiers assigned to the BSB HQ and staff. \nThe HQ company also provides fi eld feeding to the BSB HHC, distribution company, field maintenance \ncompany, and medical company.  \nCOMMANDER  \n2-5. BSB commanders are the BCTs or fires, maneuver enhancement senior logistician. BSB \ncommanders are the primary advisor to the brig ade commander on the sustai nment of all brigade \noperations. They provide guidance to the BSB staff and the brigade’s sustainment S-4 in order to \neffectively achieve the brigade co mmander’s intent. The BSB commander is responsible for logistics \nsynchronization and execution. The BSB commander, supported by their staffs, use the operations process \nChapter 2  \n2-2 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 to drive the conceptual and detailed planning necessa ry to understand, visua lize, and describe their \noperational environment; make and articulate decisions; and direct, lead, and assess military operations. As \nthe senior logistician, BSB commanders coach both the BSB and BCT staff on the importance of \nsynchronized logistics. They also stress the importance of AHS support to the BCT and BSB commanders using input concerning the health of the command and other AHS support matters from the brigade \nsurgeon/staff. BSB commanders act both as a senior mentor and an advocate for logisticians. \n2-6. As the senior logistics commander charged with responsibility to track and control the logistics \noperations, the BSB commander must retain the ability to surge, mass, and re-allocate logistics capabilities \nin accordance with the BCT commanders intent and the opera tional and mission variables. The BSB \ncommander must be thoroughly familiar with army command and support relationships and be able to apply the criteria to different sets of conditions. The BSB commander will encounter a variety of situations \nthat will require creative thinking to determine the best support options to the maneuver commander while \nmaintaining most effective logistic support. ADRP 5-0, The Operations Process , contains detailed \ninformation about command and staff relationships. \nCOMMAND SERGEANT MAJOR  \n2-7. The BSB command sergeant major is the senior enlisted member of the BSB and a member of the \ncommander's personal staff. The command sergeant major provides another set of senior eyes to assist the \ncommander. The command sergeant major communicates  with supported unit’s command sergeants major \nto verify the quality of support and to resolve BSB Sold ier’s issues for Soldiers in direct support to other \nunits. The command sergeant major provides technical  and tactical advice to the commander on the \nplanning, training, preparation, and execution of all BSB missions. The command sergeant major is located \nwherever the duties require.  \nEXECUTIVE OFFICER (XO) \n2-8. The brigade support battalion exec utive officer is the commander’s chief of staff. The executive \nofficer directs, coordinates, supervises, trains, and synchronizes the work of the staff and ensures effective \nand prompt staff actions. The XO must understand th e commander’s intent and ensure the brigade support \nbattalion staff implements it. The BSB XO provides the commander with the tools to visualize, describe, \ndirect, and assess operations. The executive officer mon itors the status of all subordinate units and ensures \nthat status is provided to the BSB commander. \n2-9. The BSB XO facilitates decision making for the commander by managing commander’s critical \ninformation requirements (CCIRs), synchronizing the BSB staff during the military decision making \nprocess, and establishing and maintaining staff fusion throughout the planning, preparation, and execution \nphases. The executive officer determines liaison requirements with the BCT headquarters and supervises \nthe liaison officers. Other XO duties can include supe rvising the creation of and approval of the logistics \nstatus report, establishing the BSB command post , and its operations, and positioning units within the \nbrigade support area. \nUNIT MINISTRY TEAM (UMT) \n2-10. The BSB UMT consists of a chaplain and a chapla in assistant. The role of the BSB UMT is to \nprovide and perform unit religious support to Soldiers and authorized civilians as directed by the BSB \ncommander. The chaplain advises the commander on matter s of religion, morals, and morale as affected by \nreligion, and on the impact of indigenous religions on military operations. The UMT provides area and denominational religious support per the brigade religious support plan under the technical supervision of \nthe BCT chaplain.  \n2-11. As a member of the BSB commander’s personal staff, the chaplain has multiple roles. Refer to FM 1-\n05, Religious Support , for more detailed information on the duties and responsibilities of the chaplain. The \nBSB UMT ministers to BSB Soldiers throughout the br igade area. Developing and executing a battlefield \ncirculation plan allows the UMT to synchronize religious visits with BSB activity external to the BSB headquarters.  \nBSB Capabilities and Organization  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 2-3 STAFF ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTIONS  \n2-12. The coordinating staff of the BSB includes the Sustain I sections, Current Ops sections, Network \nOperations, and Sustain II. The BSB command group and coordinating staff perform mission command \nfunctions through a mission command system. Mission command system  is the arrangement of personnel, \nnetworks, information systems, processes and procedures, and facilities and equipment that enable commanders to conduct operations. (ADP 6-0). The Sustain I section includes the S-1 (battalion personnel \nofficer) and the S-4. The Sustain II section include s support operations offi cer and the sustainment \nautomation support management office, the Current Operations section incl udes the S-2 (battalion \nintelligence staff officer) and the S-3. Figure 2-1 depicts the BSB headquarters and staff. \nFigure 2-1. BSB headquarters and staff \n2-13. The BSB staff assists subordinate units and consistently communicates with and informs units and \norganizations outside the headquarters. They ensure  that decisions, directives, and instructions are \nimplemented and that the BSB commander’s intent is fulfilled. In addition to the generic staff duties \nidentified in ATTP 5-0.1, Commander and Staff Officer Guide, BSB staff proactively identifies and solves \nsustainment issues. Most relevant data is identified and reported through the Force XXI Battle Command \nBrigade and Below (FBCB2) system. Additional, more detailed, supply point status is available via \nautomated commodity reports from Battle Command Sustainment Support System (BCS3). The staff:  \n Uses Army mission command systems to maintain sustainment situational understanding.  \n Works closely with higher HQ staff to resolve sustainment problems.  \n Recommends sustainment priorities that conform to mission requirements.  \n Recommends sustainment related CCIR.  \n Ensures the commander is apprised of critical sustainment issues.  \n Coordinates with key automated system operators and managers to assure continuity of support. \nSustain I – S-1 Section \n2-14. The S-1 serves as the BSB principal staff officer  for human resources support and other issues \nimpacting on the health, morale, and welfare of BSB Soldiers. The S-1 coordinates medical, religious, and \nlegal support and is responsible for developing the human resource support portion of operations \nplan/operations order (OPLAN/OPORD). \n2-15. Human resource support in the BSB includes, perso nnel accountability, strength reporting, casualty \noperations, personnel information management, personnel  readiness, essential pe rsonnel services, postal \noperations, and command interest programs. The S-1 relies on the brigade S-1 for direct coordination with \nHuman Resources Command on replacement and assignme nt of BSB personnel. The brigade S-1 also \nsupports the BSB S-1 by providing or coordinating human resource support beyond the capabilities of the \n\nChapter 2  \n2-4 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 BSB S-1 or brigade S-1. See FM 1-0, Human Resources Support , for additional information on human \nresource support tasks and functions. \nSustain I - S-4 Section \n2-16. S-4 coordinates the strategic and operational depl oyment of the BSB, as well as the request for \nmovement through controlled routes. Specifically, the S-4 coordinates for internal supply functions, \ndetermines supply requirements (except medical), determines supply priorities for publication in \nOPLAN/OPORDs, and coordinates the requisition, acquisition, and storage of supplies and equipment. The S-4 maintains unit equipment lists and assists in developing unit movement plans for the BSB.  \n2-17. Internally, the S-4 monitors field feeding, property book activities, maintenance operations, unit \nbasic loads, equipment operational status and the status of requisitions for equipment and supplies. The BSB S-4 also manages BSB budget, to include the funding approval portion of execution management \nunder Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS- Army (F/T)), acquires and assigns facilities, and \ndevelops the internal battalion logistics status report. \nNetwork Operations – S-6 Section \n2-18. The battalion signal staff officer (S-6) is the pr incipal staff officer for communications and \nresponsible for electromagnetic spectrum operations, an d networks within the BSB area of operations. The \nS-6 advises the commander, staff, and subordinate units on communications and for establishing \nautomation systems administration procedures for all information systems. S-6 primary function is ensuring \nthe integrity of the frequency modulation and digital communications network. The S-6 also ensures sustainment automation support management office functions are reflected in the brigade electronic warfare \nplan to ensure the security and use of the Very Small Aperture Terminals and wireless Combat Service \nSupport Automated Informati on System Interface network. Signal specia lists install, operate, and maintain \ncommunications equipment and ensure communication links with higher, adjacent, subordinate, and \nsupported units.  \n2-19. The S-6 is responsible for the full range of tasks associated with network management, systems \nadministration, and systems/software  security for all tactical automa tion. The S-6 uses the command post \nnode to establish a secure wireless local area network for the logistics network.  \nCurrent Ops – S-2 Section \n2-20. The S-2 is the principal staff officer responsible  for providing intelligence to support current and \nfuture operations and plans. This officer gathers and analyzes knowledge on  the factors of METT-TC \nvariables for the commander, subordinate commanders and staff. Examples of the critical S-2 input to \noperations includes analysis regarding how weather a ffects the MSR, the impact  enemy’s tactics changes \nhave on convoys, supply routes, and logistics release points. The S-2 develops a means to collect, analyze \nand disseminate information from batta lion personnel returning from convoy operations and other support \nmissions. This includes any contractors or civilian personnel who participated in the support mission. \nInformation gathered from support missions must be evaluated and shared higher, lower and laterally. All \ninformation must be evaluated to determine value, ability to answer the commanders’ priority intelligence \nrequirements, or to update intelligence annexes to  OPLANS/OPORDS, daily intelligence summary for \nsubordinate units, and intelligence estimates. ADRP 2-0, Intelligence,  provides more detail of intelligence \noperations. \nCurrent Ops - S-3 Section \n2-21. The S-3 is responsible for synchronizing and integrating BSB sustainment operations with war \nfighting functions for the commander. The S-3 operations officer ensures warfighting function integration and synchronization across the planning horizons in current operations, future operations, and plans \nintegrating cells. Current and future operations must be assessed and responsibility for each area fixed and \nacted on as a team. The S-3 recommends a location and proposes the layout for the BSA. The S-3 is \nresponsible for writing and reviewing the battalion’s tactical standard operating procedures (SOP) and \nprepares friendly forces overlays. \nBSB Capabilities and Organization  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 2-5 2-22. S-3 plans and operations officers prepare, coordinate, authenticate, publish, review, and distribute \nwritten operation orders and plans. They work closely w ith the BSB support operations section to assist in \nthe development of the concept of support for the brigade. The S-3 also coordinates with the BSB SPO to: \ndevelop the unit task organization, plan and execute operations security and develop the force module packages for BSB deployment. Planners recommend/incorporate all technologies/automation, combat unit \nrequirements, unit historical data, current/future  logistics posture, mobility data, and commander’s \nguidance into the development of the support plan. S-3 plans and operations officers plan tactical troop movements, including route selection, priority of movement, timing, security, bivouacking, quartering, \nstaging, and preparing movement orders. \nSustain II - Support Operations (SPO) \n2-23. The BSB SPO is the principal staff officer responsible for synchronizing BSB distribution operations \nfor all units assigned or attached to the brigade. The BSB SPO is responsible for applying the BSB \ncapabilities against the brigade’s requirements. The brigade S-4 identifies requirements through daily \nlogistic status reports, running estimates, and mission analysis.  \n2-24. The brigade S-4 is the log planner for the brigade, focusing on long range planning. The SPO \nstraddles mid range and short range planning and execution (future operations). The SPO also develops the concept of support and the distribution or logistics package (LOGPAC) plan. Logistics package  is a \ngrouping of multiple classes of supply and supply vehicles under the control of a single convoy \ncommander. (ADRP 1-02). The BSB SP O also works closely with the brigade surgeon when forming the \nAHS concept of support. ADRP 5-0, The Operations Process , and ATTP 5-0.1, Command and Staff \nOperations Guide , provide a graphic and written explanation of the plans to operations transition and \ntransition among staff integrating cells.  \n2-25. The support operations officer provides planning, preparation, and oversight of logistics and AHS \nsupport tasks during the execution BSB operations in  the brigade’s AO. The BSB SPO tracks the common \noperating picture for logistics within each formation and throughout the BCT to ensure timely delivery of \nrequired support at the decisive place and time. The SPO coordinates su pport for all units assigned or \nattached to the brigade. \n2-26. The SPO plans and coordinates orders published by the S-3 for execution by all subordinate BSB \nunits, including the FSC, during the performance of current operations and brigade support operations. \nThese orders can include a synchronization matrix ou tlining the plan for execution. This enables the BCT \nS-4 and all subordinate BSB units to be aware of the brigade support plan. The BSB SPO uses the logistics \nreport to update the synchronization matrix. The updated logistics report and logistics synchronization \nmatrix complement paragraph 4 and Annex F of the OPORD, or fragmentary order. \n2-27. The BSB SPO is the key interface be tween supported units and the su stainment brigade. The SPO is \nresponsible for coordinating support requirements with the sustainment brigade SPO. Requirements are \ndetermined in coordination with the brigade S-1, brigade S-4, and BSB S-3.  \n2-28. The support operations officer performs logistic s preparation of the battlefield and advises the \ncommander on the relationship of support requirements to support assets available. The SPO plans and \nmonitors support operations and makes necessary adjustments to ensure support requirements are met, and provides the status of SPO tracked systems and materiel as required to update the BSB logistics status \nreport. Materiel  is defined as all items (including ships, tanks, self-propelled weapons, aircraft, etc., and \nrelated spares, repair parts, and support equipment, but excluding real property, installations, and utilities) \nnecessary to equip, operate, maintain , and support military activities without  distinction as to its application \nfor administrative or combat purposes (JP 4-0). \n2-29. The BSB SPO routinely conducts a brigade logistics synchronization meeting. Attendees may \ninclude the BCT S-4, FSC commanders, BSB SPO section staff and maneuver battalion S-4s as well as any \nsupporting sustainment echelon above brigade coordinating staff. Attendees consider calendars, unit battle rhythms, current orders, logistics reports, sustainment synchronization matrix, commander’s guidance and \nother pertinent information. Meeting products include warning orders, SPO guidance and updated \ncalendars, synch matrices, and logistics posture. \nChapter 2  \n2-6 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 SPO/Operations \n2-30. The SPO officers and noncommissione d officers (NCOs) work closel y with the BSB S-3, BCT S-4 \nand supported battalion S-4s to coordinate future su pport requirements and locations with supported units. \nAs required, SPO personnel collocate with the BCT S-4 to execute concurrent planning operations and develop the logistic estimate and support plans for future operations.  \n2-31. The support operations section provides centralized and integrated planning for all support operations \nwithin the brigade. Although the section’s structure vari es slightly by type of BSB, SPO functions generally \ninclude; transportation, maintenance, ammunition, Army  health systems support (except fires, BFSB and \nMEB), and distribution operations. Stryker brigade SPO’s have an operations officer who provides direct \noversight of the materiel management section in order to manage all classes of supply, less class VIII. \n2-32. The SPO develops associated logi stics annexes to all plans and or ders, anticipates and forecasts \nrequirements for support and maintains the runnin g estimate. The support operations section takes \ninformation from the distribution system to create a synchronized picture of the flow of units, personnel, and materiel into and throughout the AO. \n2-33. The SPO section coordinates logistics provided to the BCT and provides the technical supervision for \nthe external logistics mission of the BSB. The section coordinates with the S-1 and S-4 to track available \nlogistics assets and coordinates with the S-2 and S-3 for operational locations and schedules of the \nsupported units.  \n2-34. The medical operations officer, the medical logistics officer, and medical operations sergeant in \ncoordination with the BSB SPO, provide planning and oversight of AHS support tasks. The medical \noperations officer must consider placement of all AHS  support assets within the brigade. They also \ncoordinate the ordering, receipt, and distribution of class VIII and blood products within the BCT. This \nsection coordinates with the brigade surgeons cell and as appropriate, division surgeon sections for all AHS \nsupport issues affecting the brigade. The medical opera tions officer is directly responsible for providing \nmedical operations guidance and status to the BSB Commander. See the appropriate brigade level field \nmanual for additional AHS support available in the supported brigade. \n2-35. The SPO is responsible for transportation operatio ns in support of the Brigade. Transportation \noperations develops movement plans to support distribution requirements. It plans for and coordinates \nemployment of organic and attached assets to m eet mission requirements. The SPO staff channels \ninformation to the transportation officer to allow fo r overall coordination, prioritization and decision-\nmaking by the support operations officer. The SPO al so coordinates with the BCT  S-4 mobility warrant.  \n2-36. The BSB SPO manages munitions for the brigade, provides staff supervision to the distribution \ncompany’s ATHP, and provides techni cal assistance and advice on muniti ons management to brigade units. \nThis section maintains records of munitions allocations, receipts, and expenditures for brigade units. The \nammunition officer in the SPO also functions as the brigade ammunition officer. \n2-37. The brigade ammunition officer is the principal mun itions staff officer for the brigade. The brigade \nammunition officer assists the BSB commander in all matters pertaining to brigade munitions support and \nrepresents the brigade commander on matters concerning munitions requirements and availability. The \nbrigade ammunition officer also maintains direct liais on with the brigade S-3 and S-4 within limits defined \nby the BSB commander or SPO. More information re garding brigade ammunition officer responsibilities \nare in FM 4-30.1, Munitions Distribution in the Theater of Operations.  \n2-38. The BSB SPO is responsible for coordinating the resupply of bulk fuel to the FSCs and from the \nsustainment brigade to the BSB distribution company. The SPO also provides supervision and management \nof general supplies (less class V) within the brigade. They monitor the on-hand stocks within BSB companies, determine requirements, coordinate local purchase, retrograde, and distribution of supplies. \nThey also provide oversight of parts requirements and projections of parts availability.  \n2-39. The BSB SPO also has a management role in the enterprise system, GCSS-Army (F/T). Roles in \nGCSS-Army (F/T) are divided vertically between management and clerical and horizontally between office \nand warehouse. Roles determine what a user can see or  do in the enterprise resource planning system. The \nBSB SPO is responsible for the materiel release po rtion of execution management under Global Combat \nSupport System-Army (field/tactical ). Refer to GCSS-Army (F/T) user manuals for more information. \nBSB Capabilities and Organization  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 2-7 2-40. The SPO staff also includes the mortuary affairs NCO who advises the commander on mortuary \naffairs, develops detailed operational mortuary affair s plans, establishes the brigade’s mortuary affairs \npolicy, and trains subordinate BCT units on unit level battlefield recovery tasks, which includes search and \nrecovery, tentative identification, pr eserving human remains and safeguarding of the personal effects. The \nmortuary affairs NCO also coordinates with the sustai nment brigade and mortuary affairs units in the area \nto synchronize the evacuation of the brigade’s remains, and to understand the mortuary affairs concept of \noperations.  \n2-41. The SPO is responsible for all brigade maintenance management. They manage field maintenance for \nall equipment assigned to the brigade and provide maintenance oversight of the field maintenance company \nand FSC’s maintenance sections. The maintenance management personnel also plan and forecast \nmaintenance and related materiel requirements such as recovery and battle damage assessment and repair \n(BDAR) based on future operational plans. Maintena nce management in the BCT requires coordination and \ncollaboration between the SPO, FSC, combat repair  teams, and the field maintenance company’s \nmaintenance control officers (MCO). \n2-42. The SPO is also the direct interf ace with the brigade logistics support  team’s chief who is responsible \nfor the brigade logistics support team operations an d personnel. The brigade logistics support team \nexpedites repair parts delivery and facilitates and prioritizes field service representative support. \n2-43. The sustainment automation support management office is part of the SPO and is the network \nadministrator of the tactical Very Small Apertu re Terminals and wireless Combat Service Support \nAutomated Information System Interface network. Th e sustainment automation support management office \nplans, prepares, executes, and sustains the tactical sustainment information syst ems network to meet the \nchallenges in all environments. The sustainment automation support management office is not responsible \nfor equipment inventory, physical security, equipment setup, disassembly, and movement of supported \nunits. This is the responsibility of the hand receipt hol der or section assigned per unit property book. As the \nnetwork administrator, the sustainment automation support management office will manage network \nconfiguration and supervise access operations related to supported units. Sustai nment automation support \nmanagement office coordinates with the S-6 to integrate into the brigade communications and electronic warfare plan to ensure security and use of its vital functions. The sustainment automation support \nmanagement office monitors and inputs information automation status to the logistics status report as \nrequired. Refer to ATP 4-0.6, Techniques for Sustainment Information Systems Support, for more \ninformation about the sustainment automation support management office duties and certifications.  \nSECTION III – BRIGADE SUPPOR T BATTALION ORGANIZATIONS \n2-44. This section describes the types of BSBs supportin g the brigade. The BSB consists of specifically \nforce designed units capable of supporting their particular BCT or support brigade.  \nBRIGADE COMBAT TEAM BSB \n2-45. The ABCT, IBCT and SBCT have a headquarters and headquarters company, a distribution \ncompany, a field maintenance company, and a brigad e support medical company which provides Role 2 \nAHS support to the BSB an d the supported brig ade. They each have six forw ard support companies that \nprovide multifunctional logistics support to a maneuver battalion; one per armored reconnaissance \nbattalion, one for each of three combined arms battalions, one for the fires battalion and one for the brigade engineer battalion. Figure 2-2 on page 2-8 depicts a BSB typical of a brigade combat team.  \n2-46. The BSB has from three to ten subordinate companies depending on the type of BSB. All BSBs have \na headquarters and headquarters company, a distribution company which provides supplies to supported battalions and/or forward support companies and a field maintenance compan y which provides field \nmaintenance support to the BSB and to the supported brigade. \n2-47. The distribution, field maintenance, and medical company commanders are lik ely to operate in the \nvicinity of the BSB command post (CP) to facilitate c oordination. However, they do not tie themselves to \none spot. They command their companies from the loca tions where they can best assess and influence the \nsupport operation. \nChapter 2  \n2-8 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 Figure 2-2. Brigade support battalion within a BCT \nFIRES BSB, MANEUVER EN HANCEMENT BRIGADE BSB  \n2-48. The fires brigade BSB contains an HHC, a distri bution company, and a fiel d maintenance company. \nThe fires brigade FSCs are not organic to the BSB and are designed to support the particular type of field \nartillery battalion of which the brigade is comprised.  The fires brigade BSB does not contain a medical \ncompany but depends upon its Role 1 unit AHS support and medical company area support. Figure 2-3 depicts a BSB within a fires brigade/maneuver enhancement brigade. \nFigure 2-3. BSB within fires brigade/maneuver enhancement brigade \n2-49. The role of the SPO is to coordinate support requ irements for the field artillery battalions. Since there \nis no medical company, the SPO is not responsible for synchronizing Army health service support. Nor is the SPO synchronizing the FSC’s activities, instead th e SPO has a coordinating function. The SPO has staff \nsupervision of a multi class supply support activity (SSA) and an ATHP as well as a small maintenance \nshop that is responsible for field maintenance on BSB and brigade headquarters equipment. Although not \n\nBSB Capabilities and Organization  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 2-9 allocated a brigade logistics support  team, the fires brigade can request brigade logistics support team \ncapabilities from the supporting Army field support brig ade. The fires brigade has one organic battalion, \neither a multiple launch rocket system or high-mobility artillery rocket system battalion, every other \norganization is attached. Those attachments are usually  OPCON or attached to brigade combat teams to \nsupport mission requirements.  \n2-50. The MEB BSB contains an HHC, a distribution comp any and a field maintenance company. It does \nnot contain FSCs or a medical company. In the MEB, there are no organic battalions. Every organization is attached. The role of the SPO is to  coordinate support requirements for the military police and engineer \nbattalions task organized to the MEB. Those attach ments are usually OPCON or attached to brigade \ncombat teams to support mission requirements. The SPO has staff supervision of the multiclass supply support activity, the ATHP and the field maintena nce company. The MEB’s field maintenance company \nprovides field maintenance for equipment within the BSB and brigade headquarters. Although not allocated \na brigade logistics support team, the maneuver enhan cement brigade can request brigade logistics support \nteam capabilities from the supportin g Army field support brigade. \nSECTION IV – BATTLEFIELD S URVEILLANCE BRIGADE SUPPORT \nCOMPANY  \n2-51. The battlefield surveillance brigade conducts reconnaissance and surveillance to answer the division \ncommander’s information requirements, enabling him to focus joint elements of combat power. The \nbrigade also provides assets to enhance the reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities of other units in the division, including BCTs. The information it collects focuses on the enemy, terrain and weather, and civil \nconsideration factors of METT-TC which feeds the development and update of the common operational \npicture (COP). The battlefield surveillance brigade is organized with a military intelligence battalion and a reconnaissance and surveillance squadron. Refer to FM 3-55.1, Battlefield Surveillance Brigade (BFSB ), \nfor more information. This section describes the brigade support company role, organization, and \noperations. Figure 2-4 depicts an example of a possible battlefield surveillance brigade task organization. \nFigure 2-4. A notional battlefield surve illance brigade (BFSB) task organization \nROLE \n2-52. Provide field feeding, field maintenance and supply  distribution support to a battlefield surveillance \nbrigade (BFSB). \nORGANIZATION \n2-53. The BFSB contains a brigade suppo rt company, not a BS B. The brigade suppor t company is organic \nto the BFSB and depends on the BFSB for administrative support, planning and operations management \nand sustainment automation support. The brigade support company contains capabilities that are generally commensurate with a BSB, but is si zed as a company based on the BFSBs support requirements. It contains \n\nChapter 2  \n2-10 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 a headquarters platoon, a distribution platoon with field feeding, class III and water, a robust maintenance \nplatoon and an organic Role 1 AHS support capability.  \n2-54. . The distribution platoon consists of a distribution section, a water section and a multi class supply \nsupport activity (SSA). The maintenance platoon co nsists of a maintenance control section, field \nmaintenance section, service and recovery section and field maintenance teams that support military \nintelligence and reconnaissance and surveillance units . Figure 2-5 depicts a BFSB brigade support \ncompany. \nOPERATIONS \n2-55. The BFSB S-4 is responsible for planning and coordinating the additional logistical support and field \nmaintenance. The brigade support company is depend ent upon elements of the sustainment brigade for \nreplenishment operations, BDAR, combat spares, additional field maintenance support including \ncommunications electronics and comm unications security equipment. \n2-56. The BFSB differs from a BCT in that it does not have a BSB staffed to provide SPO functions. The \nBFSB S-4 section has the required personnel and logistics management automation systems to perform SPO functions. The BFSB S-4 is the lead sustainment planner and is responsible for planning and \ncoordinating the additional logistical support and fi eld maintenance. The BFSB S-4 section plans and \nprovides oversight for the brigade’s logistics operations and integrates them with the other sustainment staff plans and estimates. The S- 4 essentially acts as the SPO. \n2-57. As lead sustainment planning elem ent in the BFSB, the S-4 section integrates sustainment concepts \nand plans into operational plans and estimates. The S-4 is responsible for the sustainment annex to brigade orders and plans and develops concepts for support. Using these documents as a base, the S-4 also \ncoordinates as needed with the supported unit G-4 assi stant chief of staff, logistics or J-4 logistics, \ndirectorate of joint staff, and th e sustainment brigade for additional assets to support attachments. \nFigure 2-5. Battlefield surveillance brigade support company \n2-58. The S-4 communicates requirements and projectio ns both to higher- echelon sustainment \norganizations (such as the sustainment brigade and medical brigade) and to the supported unit staff. The \nBFSB S-4 coordinates with the supporting sustainment brigade and the supported G-4/J-4 for replenishment of supplies (except medical) and evacua tion of unserviceable automotive and armament \nassemblies. The S-4 also coordinates with and maintains staff supervision over the brigade support \ncompany to ensure that organic and attached units receive maintenance,  supply, transportation, and field \n\nBSB Capabilities and Organization  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 2-11 services support. The S-4 section co ordinates class VIII supply with the BFSB surgeon section. Movement \nof class VIII materiel into the BFSB and internally within the BFSB is coordinated by the S-4 and the \nBFSB surgeon section. \n2-59. Also unique to the brigade support company is the military intelligence forward support platoon. The \nforward support platoon provides direct support to any military intelligence battalion not organic to the \nBFSB. Refer to FM 3-55.1, Battlefield Surveillance Brigade (BFSB) , sustainment chapter, for details about \nhow the brigade support company supports BFSB units. \n2-60. The brigade support company provides limited logistics and field maintenance support to the BFSB. \nAlthough the BFSB brigade support company is not part of a BSB, its supply distribution, class III and bulk \nwater, maintenance, and field feeding functions are sim ilar to that of the brigad e FSCs. However, the BFSB \nbrigade support company does not have a class V distribution section or organic medical supply, treatment, \nor evacuation capability. The brigade support company relies on other elements of the brigade for AHS \nsupport. \n \nThis page intentionally left blank .  \n \n \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 3-1 Chapter 3 \nDistribution Company \nThe brigade support battalion’s distributio n company is the pr imary supply and \ntransportation hub of the BCT. It manages the distribution of supplies to the brigade. \nIt provides distribution capab ility for classes I, II, III, IV , V , IX and unclassified \nmaps. This chapter describes the role, organi zation, and operations of the distribution \ncompany. \nROLE \n3-1. The role of the BSB distribution company is to plan, direct, and supervise supply distribution to the \nbrigade. It conducts daily receipt, storage, and issue of supply classes I, II, III, IV, V and IX and transports cargo for the brigade. This unit is  employed in the brigade support area and operates throughout the \nsupported brigade area.  \nORGANIZATION \n3-2. A BSB distribution company has three platoons: a transportation platoon, a supply platoon and a fuel \nand water platoon, as shown in figure 3-1. Distribution companies perform the same functions within a BSB, however the capabilities of the unit are unique to the brigade to which it is assigned. Fuel storage, \nwater purification and additional transportation assets  are centralized within CSSBs. The BSB SPO will \ncoordinate with the sustai nment brigade SPO to ensure  this support is in place.  For additional information \nabout the sustainment brigade and CSSB capabilities see ATP 4-93, Sustainment Brigade . \nFigure 3-1. Distribution company  \nOPERATIONS \n3-3. The distribution company operates stationary assets such as the SSA and the ATHP and is also \nresponsible for distributing supplies to the FSCs. The intent of the following material is to illustrate what \nthe distribution company does and to provide references for how to do the functional tasks.  \n\nChapter 3  \n3-2 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 COMPANY HEADQUARTERS  \n3-4. The company commander executes mission command for all company operations. The commander \nexecutes planned distribution tasks in support of the BSB commander’s concept of support and manages \ntask organization and employment of all distribution assets. \n3-5. The first sergeant is the company senior NCO and normally is its most experienced Soldier. The first \nsergeant is the commander’s primary logistics and tacti cal advisor. The first sergeant collaborates with the \ncommander and operations officer to plan, coordinate, an d supervise all logistics activities that support the \ncompany mission. The first sergeant goes wherever the duties require.  \n3-6. The company operations officer is the company se cond in command and functions as the company \nexecutive officer. The operations officer is the primar y internal logistics planner and coordinator. The \noperations officer and the company headquarters section operate the company CP. Their duties include \ntactical and logistics coordination with higher, adjacent, and supporte d units. The operations officer may \nalso serve as officer in char ge for the quartering party or company movement officer.  \nTRANSPORTATION SUPPORT  \n3-7. The transportation platoon provides transportation support to the brigade and distribution of supplies \nto the FSCs. The transportation pl atoon headquarters provides lead ership, supervision and technical \nguidance to tactical truck squads performing motor tr ansport operations to brigade units. The transportation \nplatoon executes missions when ordered by the company or BSB. ATP 4-11, Army Motor Transport \nOperations , has more detailed information on transportation operations. \nSUPPLY SUPPORT  \n3-8. The supply platoon leader provides leadership and technical supervision to the platoon and ensures \nall operations comply with applicable safety gui delines and BCT and BSB SOPs. The supply platoon \noperates the multiclass SSA and the ATHP. The supply pl atoon provides class I, II, IV, V, VII, and IX \nsupport to the BCT. The stock cont rol section executes stock control and accounting functions for the SSA. \nThe section manages a facility for supported commoditi es and coordinates with support operations for \ndelivery and pickup of issued assets and turn-ins for maintenance and/or disposal. This includes performing \nwarehouse and inventory management activities. References for automated document processing and warehousing operations include AR 710-2, Supply Policy Below the National  Level,  DA PAM 710-2-1, \nUsing Unit Supply System , and unit SOPs. \n3-9. The Army is implementing a newer web-based enterprise resource planning system called GCSS-\nArmy (F/T). GCSS-Army (F/T) uses sophisticated web based enterprise resource planning technology for \nreceipt, storage operations, issue, and accountability of supplies through out the supply ch ain. There are \nmodules within GCSS-Army (F/T) that refer to the warehousing and storage functions accomplished in the \nmulti-class SSA. Materiel managers use the materiel management module to provide oversight to enforce \nsupply discipline using financial controls to achieve end-to-end logistics. Ther e are multiple resources and \ntraining guides available for more information on GCSS-Army (F/T). \nMulticlass Supply Support Activity (SSA) \n3-10. The general supply section receives stores and issues, supplies. The supplies may then be part of a \nLOGPAC going forward to the FSCs. They also provid e repair parts to the field maintenance company, \nmaintain the brigades authorized stockage list (ASL ), and provide direct exchange for reparable/salvage \nitems. The supply platoon is capable of handling packag ed water for receipt, storage, and issue operations \n(packaged water is treated the same as dry cargo). \n3-11. The supply section designs and establishes the SSA.  The supply point layout must be organized and \nwell designed. A well planned layout improves the ability to secure the area and the stored materiel, lends itself to safe operations, and creates  an efficient work flow. An SSA sk etch should show the use of the \nspace (receiving, shipping, bulk  storage, open yard storage, office sp ace), and the materiel stored (repair \nparts, construction materials, end items). Every deploy ment is different and every supply point is different. \nDistribution Company  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 3-3 Each SSA storage layout is METT-TC  dependant. Remember to include the following considerations when \nplanning the SSA layout:  \n A way to secure the site and establish safe and efficient traffic flow. Th is includes entrance and \nexit control points and parking areas. \n Storage for all commodities including storage areas for large equipment, such as generators and \nvehicles, pilferable items, and items requiring controlled climate. \n Potential to integrate existing structures into SSA design.  \n Thoroughly review the terrain; look for swampy or wet areas, potential flood sites, presence of \nanimal or insect infestations and ability to expand the site. \n3-12. The distribution company conducts replenishment operations in two ways; supply point distribution \nin which the FSC comes to the SS A to receive supplies and unit dist ribution, or LOGPAC, where the \ndistribution company delivers to the FSCs. The distribution company receives supplies from the supporting \nsustainment brigade with the capability to store these supplies and issue them to units within the BSA, and to the FSCs. \n3-13. Retrograde of materiel is the return of new, reparable or salvageable materiel from the owning/using \nunit back through the distribution system to the source of supply, directed ship-to location and/or point of disposal. Retrograde of materiel is as important as the forward distribution of materiel.  \nAmmunition Transfer and Holding Point (ATHP) Section \n3-14. The ATHP section supports the brigade with cl ass V and operates the brigade ATHP. The ATHP \nsection establishes the ATHP and receives, temporar ily stores, issues, inspect s, and performs limited \nmunitions maintenance operations support for the BCT. The section also provides limited stockage \nconfiguration based on operational requirements or suspension notices. The ATHP transloads munitions to \nBSB transportation assets and positions battalion ammunition set configurations. The ATHP holds \nammunition for supported units and provides this ammunition to the supported battalions FSCs. The supply \nplatoon maintains a mobile storage capability. Refer to ATP 4-35.1, Techniques for Munitions Handlers, \nfor functional details of how the ATHP is established and operates.

The fuel and water platoon leader and platoon sergeant provide leadership and supervision of the fuel \nand water platoon. The platoon leadership is located wh ere they can best lead th e platoon. They normally \nare based in the BSA, but operat e throughout the brigade area.  \n3-16. The fuel section receives, temporarily stores, and issues bulk petroleum to the BCT. The section has \nno static storage capability and has the ability to disp lace whenever necessary. Re fer to unit authorization \ndocuments for exact type and quantities of assigned equipment. Fuel distribution operations are executed by the fuel and water platoon.  \n3-17. The platoon’s water section stores, and distributes bulk water for the brigade. Water operations in the \ndistribution company include forward mobile storage and distribution within the brigade. The BCT can expect to obtain bulk water or commercial bottled water in the theater of operations. The type of water \nobtained is dependent on the type of operation being conducted and the overall status/maturity of the \ntheater. During early portions of an operation, the BCT should expect to receive bulk purified water which \ncould transition into bottled water during later periods of the operation.  \n \nThis page intentionally left blank .  \n \n \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 4-1 Chapter 4 \nField Maintenance Company \nThe nature of the modern battlefield demands  a maintenance system that is flexible, \nresponsive, and focused on returning syst ems to operational status quickly and as \nnear as possible to the point of failure or damage. This requirement implies a forward \npresence of maintenance into brigade areas.  Maintenance assets move as far forward \nas the tactical situation permits to return  inoperable and damaged equipment to the \nbattle as quickly as possible. This chapte r describes the role, organization, and \noperations of the BSB’s field maintenance company. \nROLE \n4-1. The field maintenance company prov ides field maintenance support to the BSB, the brigade engineer \nbattalion and supported units in the BSA. It also provides limited field maintenance support to the FSCs for \nlow density commodities such as communications/electronics and armament equipment. The field \nmaintenance company is employed in the BSA.  \n4-2. Field maintenance is generally characterized by on (near) system maintenance, often using line \nreplaceable unit and component replacement, in the owni ng unit, using tools and te st equipment found in \nthe unit. Field maintenance is not limited to remove  and replace actions, but also allows for repair of \ncomponents or end items on (near) system. Field maintenance also includes adjustment, alignment, service, \napplying approved field-level modification work orders as directed, fault/failure diagnoses, battle damage \nassessment, repair, and recovery. Field maintenance is always repair and return to the user, and includes maintenance actions performed by operators. \nORGANIZATION \n4-3. Field maintenance companies are tailored to maintain the specific equipment and densities of the \nBCT they support. Therefore, th e organizational structure of both personnel and equipment will vary \nbetween BSBs. In general the field maintenance compan y is composed of a comp any headquarters and two \nplatoons: a maintenance control platoon and a maintenance platoon. Refer to unit authorization documents \nfor exact type and quantities of assigned equipment. Exact configurations of companies vary from command to command depending on METT-TC. For example, some units consolidate the maintenance \ncontrol section, shop officer, and the service and reco very section in the company headquarters. See figure \n4-1 on page 4-2 for an example of a field maintenance company. \nChapter 4  \n4-2 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 Figure 4-1. Field maintenance company (ABCT)  \nOPERATIONS \n4-4. Responsive maintenance support speeds the return of essential combat systems to battle. The thrust \nof the maintenance effort is to repl ace forward and repair rear. The intent  of the following material is to \nillustrate a way the field maintena nce company accomplishes its missions.  Details of specific maintenance \nfunctions can be found in ATTP 4-33, Maintenance Operations . \nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS  \n4-5. The company commander mission commands all person nel assigned or attached to the company. \nOne of the company commander’s chief responsibilities is to execute the BSB commanders’ maintenance \nplan in support of the SPO concept of support. The company commander manages task organization and employment of all maintenance and recovery assets . He executes the mission according to the SPO’s \nconcept of support and any additional orders. The commander is normally located in the BSA but will \nalways be where he can best command Soldiers and execute the mission. The commander provides \ninformation and advice concerning maintenance operations throughout the BSA to the BSB commander, \nsupport operations staff, the brigade engineer battalion and the brigade headquarters.  \n4-6. The first sergeant is the company’s senior NCO and normally its most experi enced Soldier. The first \nsergeant is the commander’s primary logistics and tacti cal advisor. The first sergeant collaborates with the \ncommander and XO to plan, coordinate, and supervise all logistics activities that support the company \nmission. The first sergeant is lo cated wherever the duties require. \n4-7. The company operations officer is also the compan y XO and is the company’ s second in command. \nThe XO is the primary internal logistics planner and coordinator. The XO and the company headquarters \nsection operate the company CP. His duties include tactical and logistics coordination with higher, \nadjacent, and supported units. \nFIELD MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS  \n4-8. All field maintenance companies perform the same functions within a BSB, however the capabilities \nof each unit are unique to the brigade to which it is assigned. The majority of the field maintenance \ncompany assets are located in the BSA to reduce the burden placed on mane uver elements. The field \nmaintenance company can send limited support forward to support the FSC’s FMTs or maintenance collection points (MCP) to ensure support is positioned well forward. The field maintenance company also \nprovides limited recovery and machine shop support to the battalion FSCs and brigade engineer battalion. \n4-9. The field maintenance company completes diagnostic s and determines if the piece of equipment is \nfield level maintenance or if it is sustainment level maintenance. There are general guidelines available for \nwhere and how maintenance is completed, there is no absolute checklist. Leaders must decide the best \n\nField Maintenance Company  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 4-3 course of action based on operational and mission variable s. Equipment determined to be sustainment level \nmaintenance will be evacuated to a national level pr ovider. Upon receipt of replacement class VII items, \nmaintenance personnel, along  with the equipment operator, ensure that replacement items are operational \nand ready for use. When equipment is determined to be sustainment level maintenance, supply sergeants, S-4s and property book personnel must be incorporated into the process in order to maintain accountability.  \n4-10. Sustainment level maintenance is generally character ized by “off system” co mponent repair and/or \nend item repair and return to the supply system, or by exception, back to the owning unit. It is performed by national-level maintenance providers (including the U.S. Army Materiel Command and installation \ndirectorate of logistics maintenanc e activities). The sustainment maintenance function can be employed at \nany point in the integrated logistics chain. The intent of this level is to perform commodity-oriented repairs on all supported items to return them to a national standard, providing a consistent and measureable level of \nreliability, and to execute maintenance actions not able to be performed at the field level of maintenance. \n4-11. Maintenance execution and planning should include the maintenance priorities approved or \nestablished by the guiding mission plans and orders. Other tasks could include: \n Identify maintenance collection points that are co llocated at or near mortuary affairs collection \npoints for mutual security purposes that emphasize BDAR. \n Establish criteria for requesting additional recovery assets. \n Consider the feasibility of dividing up recovery assets to provide broader coverage for attacking \ncompanies. \n Identify critical combat spares and have them  ready to move forward on short notice. \n Ensure rapid repair and return of non mission capable equipment to support the operation. \n Locate maintenance sites to be accessible to cust omers, including recovery/ BSA and near but \noff the MSR. \n Ensure maintenance shops, along with parking and equipment holding sites are on firm ground. \n4-12. The field maintenance company provides dedicated field maintenance on an area basis to the BSB \nunits as well as limited support to the FSCs and supported maneuver battalions. The field maintenance \ncompany also retains maintenance ca pabilities in the BSA since certain pieces of test equipment are not \neasily transportable. The field maintenance compan y provides field maintenance on weapons, power \ngeneration and other equipment assigned to the BCT headquarters, the brigade engineer battalion, the BSB \nand, on an area basis, for units operating in the BS A. The field maintenance company provides field \nmaintenance to the brigade’s missile and electronic equipment/weapon systems for those battalions that \ndon’t have the capability in FSCs.  \n4-13. The field maintenance company also provides welding and lift capabilities for the repair shops, \nrecovery of organic equipment, and recovery support to BSB units and elements in the BSA. Unit recovery \npolicies should be itemized in the battalion and brig ade’s SOPs and mission orders. The field maintenance \ncompany also has BDAR responsibility to units in the BSA and can provide limited assistance to the FSCs. BDAR is the rapid return of disabled equipment to the force through field-expedient repair of components. \nBDAR restores minimum essential combat capabilities to support the mission or to enable self-recovery. \nSee FM 4-30.31, Recovery and Battle Damage Assessment and Repair , for more information. \n4-14. The fires brigade field maintenance company has a wh eeled vehicle repair section that provides the \ncapabilities for automotive repair of wheeled vehicles. The wheeled vehicle repair section provides field \nmaintenance for the organic wheeled vehicles in the fire s brigade and all supported units within the BSA. It \nis managed by the maintenance control section (MCS). The wheeled vehicle repair section performs \ntroubleshooting, minor (nonstructural) welding, major and secondary component replacement, wheel \nassembly, and line replaceable unit replacement as  part of its replace forward concept.  \n4-15. Under the direction of the MCO, the MCS direct s, controls and supervises the unit’s field \nmaintenance mission and activities. The section oversees the quality of work and maintains a shop \nstock/bench stock for shop operations. They also pe rform maintenance management and production control \nfunctions for units operating within the BSA. The MC S is best located near the distribution company’s \nmulti-class SSA. The MCS is the manager for all field maintenance and recovery mission actions within the \nBSA. \nChapter 4  \n4-4 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 4-16. Maintenance management in the BCT requires coordination and collaboration between the SPO, FSC \nand the MCO. While the brigade co mmander and the XO are accountable for their unit readiness, the field \nmaintenance company MCO provides control, coordinatio n, overall management of maintenance assets and \ncollection for maintenance and readiness data. The SPO tracks maintenance, supply data and trends, provides guidance to the MCO on priorities as th ey are passed down from the brigade commander. \n4-17. The MCS operates automated mainte nance systems to support the BCT. It also serves as the main \ncollection point for all maintenance records prior to being sent to the BSB SPO staff. The Army Maintenance Management System describes the fo rms and records required to perform field level \nmaintenance. The field maintenance company or shop SOPs should outline procedures established by the \nBCT to provide accountability of equi pment in for repair. For more de tails about the Army maintenance \nsystem, refer to DA Pam 750-8, The Army Maintenance Management System . \n4-18. The MCS maintains combat spares and uses controlled component substitution and cannibalized \nspares obtained from non-repairable vehicles. Repair cycle time is expedited and maintenance is simplified \nby leveraging diagnostics/prognostics technology to identify major component failures and then replace the \ncomponents. These components include line replaceabl e units, major assemblies, and other subcomponents. \nRefer to AR 750-1, Army Material Maintenance Policy  and AR 710-2, Supply Policy below the National \nLevel , for more information on parts accountability. \n \n \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 5-1 Chapter 5 \nBrigade Support Medical Company \nThe brigade support medical company (BSMC)  provides Role 1, unit level medical \ncare, and Role 2, basic primary care, Army Health System (AHS) support to all BCT units operating within the brigade AO. Th e company also provides Roles 1 and 2 \nAHS support on an area basis to all BCT units that do not have organic medical \nassets. The BSMC commander leads and superv ises its organic and attached medical \naugmentation elements. The BSMC locates a nd establishes its company headquarters \nand a brigade Role 2 medical treatment fac ility in the BSA. This chapter describes \nthe role, organization, employment, and operations of the BSMC.  \nROLE \n5-1. The role of the BSMC is to provide AHS support to all units operating within the BSA. The BSMC \noperates a Role 2 medical facility and provides AHS support on an area basis to all BCT units that do not \nhave organic medical assets. The BSMC oversees its organic elements and maintains operational control of medical augmentation elements. The BSMC may be augmented with a forward surgical capability when \nrequired based upon mission requiremen ts or METT-TC. Refer to FM 4-02, Army Health System , and FM \n4-02.6, The Medical Company , for more information. \nORGANIZATION \n5-2. The BSMCs organic to the IBCT, ABCT, and SBCT consist of a company headquarters, preventive \nmedicine section, behavioral health section, medical treatment platoon, medical evacuation platoon, and a \nbrigade medical supply office. Refer to organizational authorization documents for current personnel and \nequipment authorizations. A typical BSMC organization is shown in figure 5-1. \nFigure 5-1. Brigade support medical company \n\nChapter 5  \n5-2 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 OPERATIONS \n5-3. The BSMC receives, triages, treats, and determ ines the disposition of patients based upon their \nmedical condition. The BSMC provides Role 2 medical care for the BCT. The BMSC provides an \nincreased medical capability with the addition of x-ray,  laboratory, combat operational stress control, and \ndental services and has 20 cots for holding patients up to 72 hours. Role 2 care includes all of the \ncapabilities and functions of Role 1 care. \nCOMPANY HEADQUARTERS  \n5-4. The company headquarters section provides unit- level administration, general supply, and CBRN \noperations support. The company also provides and coordinates medical equipment maintenance for the \nmedical platoons/sections in the BCT. \n5-5. The BSMC commander advises the BSB commander on medical aspects of battalion operations and \non the health of supported personnel. The medical co mpany commander ensures that the medical annex of \nthe OPLAN includes procedures to process and treat CBRN contaminated casualties and provisions for \nCBRN collective protective shelter systems and decontamination augmentation. The annex lists provisions \nfor supporting air and ground ambulances, augmenta tion of medical support assets for contingency \noperations, detainee operations, customer assistance on obtaining class VIII, and for medical representation \non casualty damage assessment sections. \n5-6. The first sergeant is the company’s senior NCO and normally its most experi enced Soldier. The first \nsergeant is the commander’s primary logistics and tacti cal advisor. The first sergeant collaborates with the \ncommander and XO to plan, coordinate, and supervis e all logistics activities that support the company \nmission. The first sergeant is locat ed wherever the duties require.  \n5-7. The company XO is the principal assistant to the company commander on the tactical employment of \nthe company assets. The basic considerations which infl uence the employment of medical assets within the \nbrigade are dependent on the brigade commander’s plan , the anticipated patient load, expected areas of \ncasualty density, and the medical treatment  and evacuation resources available. \nBRIGADE  MEDICAL  SUPPLY  OFFICE  (BMSO) \n5-8. The BMSO can be co-located with  the BSB SSA or serve independently as part of the BSMC as a \nforward distribution point to distribute class VIII. The BMSO also synchronizes medical logistic support for medical equipment and its maintenance within the BCT. The BMSO deploys with a three day basic load \nand preplans resupply sets for the next seven days. Th ese resupply sets will be brought in and maintained \nby the BMSO for resupply of the BCT as required.  \n5-9. The BMSO will also have limited ASL critical line items to support BMSC Role 2 medical elements \nand BCT maneuver battalion’s medical platoon Role 1 requirements. This ASL is a basic load of class VIII supply for the BCT managed as a safety level an d released to support th e brigade when routine \nreplenishment fails to meet mission requirements or wait times. Upon arrival in theater, the BMSO will be \nresupplied by push-packages until line item requisitioning is available. Once the automated ordering system \nis implemented, the BMSO will immediately start requisitioning for replacement of consumed line items. \nThese supplies will be routed to the lowest leve l supporting SSA, normally the FSC supporting the \nmaneuver battalion. For more information on medical logistics see FM 4-02.1, Army Medical Logistics .  \n5-10. Critical line items are filled from the ASL mainta ined by the BMSO when the customer wait time \nexceeds mission requirements and immedi ate resupply to the unit is require d. Routine ordering procedures \nwill resume upon arrival in theater as soon as unclassifi ed internet connectivity is established. Upon receipt \nof a requisition, the supporting SSA will fill and package the items for distribution to the requesting unit. \nThe BMSO will receive and account for materiel upon arrival to the distri bution control point located in the \nBSA. It will then integrate materiel marked for mane uver Role 1 medical treatment facility (MTF)/battalion \naid station with other critical class VIII supplies and nonmedical items to be distributed to the battalions. \nThis materiel will be broken down by classes of supp ly, and class VIII packaged materiel will be delivered \nto the medical platoons/sections' Role 1 MTF/battalion aid station where the medical platoon will inventory the received items and close out the order. \nBrigade Support Medical Company  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 5-3 MEDICAL TREATMENT OPERATIONS  \n5-11. The medical treatment platoon operates the Role 2 MTF in the BSA. It also provides limited assets to \nreinforce supported unit medical sections. The platoon receives, triages, treats, and determine disposition of \npatients. The treatment platoon also serv es as the alternate CP for the BSMC. \n5-12. The medical treatment platoon leader directs, coordinates, and supervises platoon operations based \non the BCT AHS plan. The platoon leader also directs the activities of the BSMC Role 2 MTF and \nmonitors class VIII supplies, blood usage, and inventory levels, and keeps the commander informed of \ncritical class VIII and blood requirements. The headquarters section is responsible for overseeing platoon operations, patient accountability and statistical reporting functions, and coordination with the BSB SPO, \nBCT surgeon and other elements for patient evacuation.  \n5-13. The medical treatment squad, the area support squad, and the patient-holding squad are required to \nestablish the BSMC Role 2 MTF. Wh en patients are able to return to  duty after having received treatment, \nthe BSMC Role 2 MTF coordinates through the BSB S-1, who in turn contacts the respective unit to pick up the Soldier or follows established the brigade SOP. \nMedical Treatment Section \n5-14. The medical treatment section pr ovides emergency and routine sick call treatment to Soldiers \nassigned or attached to supported units. When positioned with the BSMC, the treatment section personnel work in the Role 2 MTF. The medical treatment squads include two treatment teams to provide Role 1 \nmedical treatment and augmentation support to BCT maneuver battalions, as required.  \n5-15. The forward medical treatment squad is capable of operating independently for limited periods of \ntime to provide advanced trauma management and sick call, as required. The forward medical treatment \nsquad must be prepared for short notice forward deployment; therefore, personnel, medical equipment sets, \nand vehicles must be in a state of readiness. \n5-16. The area medical treatment squad is the base me dical treatment section of the BSMC Role 2 MTF \nand does not forward deploy. It is identical to the medical treatment squad and will generally include more experienced personnel.  \nArea Support Squad \n5-17. There are four different sections in the Area Suppor t Squad; the dental section, the physical therapy \nsection, the laboratory section, and the radiology s ection. The dental section provides operational dental \ncare which consists of emergency dental care and e ssential dental care intended to intercept dental \nemergencies. This also includes dental consultation and x-ray services. Operational dental care is the care \ngiven for the relief of pain, elimination of acute infection, control of life-threatening oral conditions such as \nhemorrhage or respiratory difficulty. Treatment of trauma to teeth, jaws, and associat ed facial structures is \nconsidered emergency care. It is th e most austere type of care and is available to Soldiers engaged in \ntactical operations. Essential care includes dental treat ment necessary for prevention of lost duty time and \npreservation of fighting strength. \n5-18. The physical therapy section plans and supervises physical therapy programs through patient self-\nreferral or referral from a medical or dental officer or other health professionals in medical settings. The \nphysical therapist provides guidance within the areas of  physical fitness, physical training and injury \nprevention. The physical th erapy staff primarily evaluates and treat s disorders of human motion through the \nuse of physical/chemical  therapeutic means. \n5-19. The laboratory section performs clinical laboratory and blood banking procedures to aid physicians \nand physician’s assistants in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. Laboratory functions include performing laboratory procedures cons istent with the Role 2 treatment capabilities. \n5-20. The radiology section provides x-ray equipment consistent with the Role 2 treatment capabilities. \nThe section performs routine clinical radiological procedures to aid physicians and physician assistants in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. \nChapter 5  \n5-4 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 Patient-Holding Squad \n5-21. The patient-holding squad operates the patient-hol ding facility of the BSMC Role 2 MTF. The \nholding facility’s primary role is to hold patients awaiting evacuation; a secondary role is to hold patients \nwho are expected to return to duty within 72 hours. It is staffed and equipped to provide care for up to 20 patients. Role 2 facilities do not have an admission capability therefore patients at this facility are not \ncounted as hospital admissions. In addition, the patient-holding facility serves as a patient-overflow \nrecovery area for the forward surgical team. \nMedical Reporting \n5-22. The AHS uses the medical communications for comb at casualty care system (MC4) that depends on \nSoldiers and care givers in the fiel d to accurately report required informa tion. All of the tools are in place to \nproperly record/report and transmit the required information. Casualty reporting is a shared responsibility, \nthe AHS reports to the S/G-1 elements and the S/ G-1 tracks and reports as required/necessary. Units \ncoordinate and execute based upon the mission and area of operations ensuring they meet the medical/casualty reporting requirements. \nEVACUATION OPERATIONS  \n5-23. Medical evacuation is always the responsibility of th e higher role of care. For example, Role 1 from \nthe point of injury, casualty collection point, or patient collection point to the battalion aid station; Role 2 MTFs (the BSMC) provides medical evacuation from the Role 1 MTF. Even though the Role 3 MTF may \nnot have organic medical evacuation capability, it is the responsibility of the Role 3 MTF to coordinate that \nmedical evacuation from the Role 2 MTF to the Role 3 MTF, the combat support hospital. The BCT has its own medical evacuation capability from point of injury or casualty collection point and on to the successive \nroles of care up to Role 2.  \n5-24. The supporting multifunctional medical battalion or medical brigade coordinates for the echelon \nabove brigade ground am bulance company. The ground ambulance co mpany may be attached or assigned \nto the multifunctional medical battalion for support in the BCT area of operations for medical evacuation to \nthe combat support hospital. \n5-25. The evacuation platoon performs ground evacuation and en route patient care for the supported units. \nThe evacuation platoon consists of a platoon headquarters, an area support evacuation section, and a \nforward evacuation section. Platoon assets are located  where they can best resp ond to requirements. The \nevacuation platoon leader maintains communications in order to direct ground evacuation of patients. The \nplatoon provides ground ambulance evacuation support for the BCT maneuver battalions and to other units \nreceiving area medical support from the BSMC.  \n5-26. The platoon leader and platoon sergeant establish and maintain contact with supported units and \nforward deployed treatment squads/teams of the BSMC. They perform route reconnaissance and develop and issue all necessary route and navigational inform ation, to include graphi c control measures. They \nreceive evacuation requests from supported units and coordinate and establish ambulance exchange points \nfor both air and ground ambulances. See FM 4-02.2, Medical Evacuation , for medical evacuation/casualty \nevacuation information. \n5-27. The evacuation squads provide ground ambulance evacuation of patients from the BSA and forward \nareas to the BSMC Role 2 MTF. Evacuation squad personnel perform emergency medical treatment, evacuate patients, and provide for their continued car e en route. They maintain supply levels for the \nambulance medical equipment sets and ensure that appr opriate property exchange s of medical items (such \nas litters and blankets) are made at sending and receiving Role 2 MTFs. \nPREVENTIVE MEDICINE  \n5-28. Commanders are responsible for protecting their Soldiers from disease non-battle injury, and must \nemphasize and enforce high standards of field sanitation and personal hygiene. Preventive medicine \nsupport can be found throughout the BCT and the BSMC. Effective preventive medicine operations are characterized by preemptive actions. L ack of or delay in implementing preemptive actions can significantly \nBrigade Support Medical Company  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 5-5 impact the deployed force’s ability to accomplish its assigned mission. Refer to DA PAM 40-11, \nPreventive Medicine , FM 21-10, Field Hygiene and Sanitation , and FM 4-25.12, Unit Field Sanitation \nTeams  for additional information. \n5-29. The preventive medicine section is primarily responsible for identifying health threats and \noccupational/environmental health hazards, assessing th e health risk associated with these threats, and \nrecommending protective measures. Under the oversight of the brigade surgeon, the preventive medicine \nsection monitors and guides implementation of the brigade preventive medicine program. They also provide training to BCT Soldiers in disease non-battle injury prevention programs. The preventive \nmedicine section develops and coordinates a preventive medicine circulation plan throughout the brigade’s \narea of operations in order to monitor supported battalions. Review FM 4-02.17, Preventive Medicine \nServices , for more information about unit preventive medicine programs. \nBEHAVIORAL HEALTH  \n5-30. The behavioral health section/combat and opera tional stress control team assists commanders with \ncontrolling combat and operational stress through prevention programs. The combat operational stress \ncontrol team operates under the di rection of the BSMC commander and provides brigade-wide behavioral \nhealth and combat operational stress control services. Deployed combat operational stress control activities include continual Soldier assessment and consultation with medical and other personnel associated with \ndeployed Soldiers. It assists and counsels personnel with personal, behavioral, or psychological problems \nand participates in the early identif ication of mild traumatic brain injury. The behavior health section does \nnot treat ongoing cases. See FM 4-02.51, Combat  and Operational Stress Control , for more details. \n5-31. The company behavioral health section normally locates with the BSMC Ro le 2 MTF as the center \nfor its operations, but is mobile throughout the brigade’s area. The section’s priority functions are to promote positive stress behaviors, prev ent unnecessary evacuatio ns, and coordinate retu rn of Soldiers to \nduty. The section keeps abreast of the tactical situ ation and plans and projects requirements for combat \noperational stress control support through the compan y commander and evacuation pl atoon leaders. combat \noperational stress control support is routinely conducted when units are pulled back for rest and \nrecuperation. For definitive information on combat operational stress control operations, see FM 6-22.5, \nCombat and Operational Stress Control Manual for Leaders and Soldiers .  \n \nThis page intentionally left blank .  \n \n \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 6-1 Chapter 6 \nAviation Support Battalion \nThe aviation support battalion (ASB) provides support to both the combat aviation \nbrigades (CAB) and theater aviation brig ades. CAB’s synchronize operations of \nmultiple aviation battalions that are task organized to provide reconnaissance, \nsecurity, close combat attack, interdiction, air assault, and air movement operations in \nsupport of ground forces under the headquart ers to which it is assigned. The CAB is \ntailored for the mission, containing both manned and unmanned systems, and can support multiple brigade combat teams.  \nROLE \n6-1. The ASB is the primary aviation logistics organization in the CAB and the theater aviation brigade. It \nis optimized to support the CAB’s forward support company/troops, aviation maintenance \ncompanies/troops and the brigade’s HHC. The ASB provid es distribution of classes I, II, III (B), IV, V, and \nIX, water storage, and operates an ATHP. It also provides field level maintenance.  \nORGANIZATION \n6-2. The ASB consists of four comp anies; the headquarters and supp ort company, the distribution \ncompany, the aviation suppo rt company, and the network support  company. The ASB is configured \ndifferently from other BSBs. The headquarters and support company provides the field maintenance and \nAHS support to the brigade. The FSCs and aviation maintenance companies are organic to aviation brigade battalions, not the ASB. Figure 6-1 depicts an example of an aviation support battalion. \nFigure 6-1. Aviation support battalion \nOPERATIONS \n6-3. The headquarters and support company maintenance platoon primarily supports the ASB’s assigned \ncompanies and aviation brigade headquarters. The ma intenance platoon oversees  the field maintenance \n\nChapter 6  \n6-2 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 activities throughout the company, performs the maintenance management and production control \nfunctions and maintains the class IX. The field maintenance section conducts ground recovery operations \nand provides maintenance evacuation for the brigade. The platoon also has automotive, power generation, \nallied trades and small arms repairmen. \n6-4. The medical platoon has the medical assets to conduct AHS support at a Role 1 medical treatment \nfacility for the CAB. The platoon is organized into headquarters, treatment, and evacuation sections. The \nbrigade HHC and flight battalions retain their organic flight surgeons and medics in their organic medical treatment team. The medical platoon provides the following capabilities for the ASB:  \n Tactical combat casualty care and acute trau ma management for wounded and disease and \nnonbattle injury patients. \n Sick call services. \n Ground ambulance evacuation from supported units. \n Mass casualty triage and management. \n Limited patient decontamination. \n6-5. The distribution company provides supply classes I, II, III, IV V, and water. The distribution \ncompany provides aircraft fueling an d serves as the supply support activ ity warehouse for class IX air and \nground parts. The distribution company is also responsible for all aircraft and ground asset refueling, and assists in the setup and management of the forward arming and refueling point. The petroleum platoon has \na two person quartermaster petroleum team assigned to  provide quality assurance testing for bulk aviation \nfuel. This is a critical tool for the aviators because it provides organic support for aircraft petroleum testing. \n6-6. The aviation support company provides field mainte nance, and support for on-aircraft and critical \noff-aircraft maintenance of unmanned aircraft system s. The aviation support co mpany also conducts BDAR \nand provides backup support to the aviation maintenance companies. Emphasis is on component replacement. Damaged or inoperable ai rcraft requiring time-consuming repa ir actions are handled in more \nsecure areas toward the rear . Training Circular 3-04.7, Army Aviation Maintenance , provides more detail \nabout aviation maintenance. \n6-7. The ASB executes replenishment operations for the FSC/forward support troops and the aviation \nmaintenance companies/troops in concert with the CAB’s operational plan. The FSC works closely with the \nbrigade aviation maintenance officer and SPO in the procurement of cla ss IX parts and acts as the direct \nlink to sustainment maintenance program representatives. \n6-8. An FSC is assigned to each operational aviation batta lion and consists of a headquarters platoon, \ndistribution platoon, and ground maintenance platoon. The FSC provides enhanced aircraft logistics and \nground maintenance capabilities. The FSC coordinates with the ASB for additional logistics as required. \nThe FSC could be located either in the supported batta lion area or in the BSA to facilitate logistics support \nfrom the brigade support area to the battalion area of  operations. The following capabilities are provided by \nthe FSC:  \n Field maintenance for all organic equipment \n Refueling and rearming support. Each of the forward arming and refueling points can be task \norganized to support continuous operations by providing support for maintenance, armament, rearming and refueling \n Field feeding capabilities.  \n Transportation assets to support logistics, recovery, and movement of personnel and equipment.   \n Transportation of all classes of supply.   \n Replenishment operations.   \n \n \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 7-1 Chapter 7 \nForward Support Company \nForward support companies provide direct s upport to brigade combat teams, fires, \naviation, and maneuver enhancement brig ades. The FSCs are the link from the BSB \nto the supported battalions and are the organization that provides the brigade, \nbattalion, and BSB commanders the greatest flexibility for providing logistics support \nto the brigade. FSC’s are organic to the BS Bs in brigade combat teams. They provide \nfield feeding, field maintenance and distribution support to their supported battalions. FSCs provide the BSB commander the ability to  prioritize the logistics effort in \nsupport of decisive operations. This chapter describes the FSC role, organization, and \noperations of the FSC. It also describes organizational differences in the various \ntypes of FSCs.  \nROLE \n7-1. The role of the FSC is to provide direct logi stics support to the supported battalion. The FSC \nprovides the supported commander with dedicated logi stics assets organized specifically to meet the \nbattalion’s requirements. An FSC provides field feeding, bulk fuel, general supply, ammunition, and field \nmaintenance. The FSC commander receives technical logistics oversight and mentoring from the BSB \ncommander. FSC commanders must have a continuous relationship with the BSB SPO. The BSB commander will utilize the SPO to ensure that all FSC commanders understand the BSB commanders \nbrigade logistics support plan.  \n7-2. The FSCs are normally organic to the BCT BSBs and are critical to the success of the logistic \nconcept of support. How the FSCs are deployed is cr itical to the success of the BCT. Depending on the \ncurrent operation and situation an FSC, for limited dura tion, may be attached to or placed under operational \ncontrol (OPCON) of its supported battalion. FSC attach ment or OPCON to its supported battalion is limited \nin duration and may be for a specific mission or phase of an operation. They can also remain under the \ndirect control of the BSB. The decision to establish these types of command relationships is made by the \nbrigade commander upon the advice of the BSB commander after careful  and thorough mission analysis. \nThere is no configuration that works in every situ ation. The commander must make a conscious decision \nfor each mission under the unique circumstances of th e operational environment. There is not a generic \ntemplate. The commander must weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each method of deployment \nand act decisively.  \nORGANIZATION \n7-3. The FSCs in the various BCTs are structured simila rly with the most significant differences in \nmaintenance capabilities. The BSB provides support to the maneuver battalions through the FSC; it \nresources the FSC to set the logistics conditions necessary to ensure maneuver success. The \nABCT/IBCT/SBCT FSC is organic to the BSB and not autonomous from the BSB by design. \n7-4. The FSCs are organized to support the combined arms battalions, Stryker, fires battalion and the \nreconnaissance squadron. The FSC depends upon the brigade support battalion and other units for the \nsupport areas listed below. As the FSCs command relationship or support relationship shifts to and from the \nBSB and the supported battalion, these dependencies must be addressed, agreed upon, and formalized by a brigade level order. \n Human resources support. \n Religious support. \nChapter 7  \n7-2 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014  Logistics COP input. \n Battlefield intelligence. \n Resupply assets to maintain the required quantity of materiel required to push forward to the \nsupported battalion. \n Roles 1 and 2 AHS support.  \n Water distribution to the FSC and its maneuver battalion. \n Reporting requirements. \n7-5. The FSC is dependent on the BSB for multiple functions and capabilities. In addition to those already \nhighlighted, the field maintenance company provides training and senior warrant officer/NCO mentorship for low density military occupational specialties in the FSC. \n7-6. The FSCs have a headquarters section, a distribution platoon, and a maintenance platoon. The \nheadquarters’ food service section provides class I support. This section provides food service and food \npreparation for the supported battalion. The food serv ice section prepares, serves and distributes the full \nrange of operational rations. Figure 7-1 is an example of an IBCT/ABCT/SBCT FSC. \nFigure 7-1. Forward support company supporting a combined arms battalion \n7-7. The distribution platoon consists of a platoon headquarters, and four squads that can be task \norganized to distribute class II, III, IV, V, and VII. The maintenance platoons vary based upon the \nequipment and major weapon systems of the supported battalion. Generally, the maintenance platoon consists of a platoon headquarters, maintenance cont rol section, field maintenance section, service and \nrecovery section and the field maintenance teams (FMTs). \n7-8. The fires brigade FSCs are separate companies. They  are normally assigned to the BSB and attached \nor OPCON to the artillery battalion for the duration of an operation, or as determined by the brigade \ncommander. The fires brigade FSCs differ depending on the type of artillery they support but are designed \nto provide the same functions of any FSC. Figure 7-2 depicts an example of an FSC supporting a fires brigade. \nOPERATIONS \n7-9. The FSC commander commands the FSC and is the senior logistician at battalion level for the \nmaneuver or support battalion. The FSC commander assists the supported battalion S-4 with the battalion logistics planning and is responsi ble for executing the logistics plan  in accordance with the supported \n\nForward Support Company  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 7-3 battalion commanders’ intent. The FSC forms the battalion echelon of support, often referred to as battalion \ntrains. \n7-10. The FSC commander must know and understand the capabilities and limitations of the company’s \npersonnel and equipment in performing the sustainment mission. He must also thoroughly understand the different types of army command and support relationships. This knowledge coupled with logistic expertise \nenables the FSC commander to make credible re commendations to both the supported maneuver \ncommander and the BSB commander. ADRP 5-0, The Operations Process , explains command and support \nrelationships. \nFigure 7-2. Forward support company supporting fires brigade \n7-11. The FSC commander must have the mental ability to shape and be shaped by changing operational \nand mission variables. As the operational and mission variables evolve, the FSCs relationship with its \nsupported battalion will change. Whatever the command/support relationship is, the FSC is an extension of \nthe BSB and a critical element to the BSB and BCT co mmanders’ ability to weight the logistic effort. The \nBSB commander and staff provide technical oversight and coordinate support to the FSCs. Both the \nlogistics and maneuver battalion commanders will influence the FSC commander in different ways at \ndifferent times.  \n7-12. The FSC commander can be located in a variety of locations based on METT-TC. FSC commanders \nlocate where they can best command the FSC and communicate with appropri ate BSB or supported \nbattalion staff. Additional discussion of echelons of suppor t is in appendix A of this ATP and is included in \nFM 3-90.6, Brigade Combat Team,  as well as the respective brigade field manuals. \nSUPPLY OPERATIONS  \n7-13. The distribution platoon leader leads the platoon, oversees LOGPAC operations and manages the \ndistribution of supplies coming from or passing through the FSC in support of the BCT units. Replenishment operations are conducted by the distribution platoon. The platoon provides general supplies, \nfuel, and ammunition to the supported battalion. Fuel storage, water purification capability and additional \ntransportation assets are centralized within CSSBs.  The BSB SPO will coordinate with the sustainment \nbrigade to ensure th is support is in place. For additional information about the sustainment brigade and \nCSSB capabilities see ATP 4-93, Sustainment Brigade . \n7-14. The distribution platoon can be task organized into battalion and company support squads. The \nsupport squad provides all supplies for a supported battalion employing companies in a widely dispersed \ngeographic area.  \n\nChapter 7  \n7-4 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 7-15. The class III section provides retail class III bulk  fuel distribution to the supported battalion and \nprovides refueling options in support of the BCT units passing through the supported battalion AO. The \nBSB distribution company pushes fu el to the FSC and the FSC pushes fuel to the maneuver battalion using \nFSC distribution assets. \n7-16. The class V section provides the distribution of ammunition to the supported battalion and conducts \nammunition resupply replenishment operations in support of BCT units. The FSC class V operation is \nbasically a transloading operation; the distribution company pushes the class V to the FSC and the FSC \npushes it to the maneuver battalion on FSC distribution assets. \nFIELD MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS  \n7-17. The maintenance platoon performs field maintenance as well as all maintenance management \nfunctions, dispatching, and scheduled service operations for the supported battalion and FSC. The platoon \nconsists of the platoon headquarters section, maintena nce control section, mainte nance section, service and \nrecovery section, and the FMTs. The FSC maintenan ce platoon coordinates all maintenance requirements \nwith the FSC commander. The maintenance platoon also performs field maintenance on FSC and supported \nbattalion’s HHC vehicles and equipment.  \n7-18. FSC maintenance priorities are determined by the supported battalion’s chain of command with \nrecommendations from the FSC commander and the MCO. The maintenance platoon’s first priority is to \nreinforce the FMTs mission. Maintenance platoon l eaders are responsible for leading the platoon and \ncontrolling and directing the accomplishment of the pl atoon’s mission. They are responsible to the MCO \nfor ensuring the completion of mainte nance jobs and adhering to priority of support as provided. ATTP 4-\n33, Maintenance Operations  provides details of maintenance functions. BDAR procedures can be found in \nFM4-30.31, Recovery and Battle Damage Assessment and Repair  (BDAR). \nMaintenance Control Section (MCS) \n7-19. The MCS is the management center for all maintenance actions in the FSC and supported battalion. \nThe MCS performs maintenance management functions, dispatching operations, and tracks scheduled services for the maneuver battalion and FSC. The MCS has a small supply section which provides class IX \nsupport including shop stock and bench stock for shop operations. It also provides exchange of reparable \nitems. \n7-20. The maintenance control officer an d the FSC’s automation systems are co-located in the MCS. The \nMCO uses them to produce the Army materiel status  system readiness reports and to analyze and assess \nmaintenance status. The MCO is responsible for preparing the readiness report for the maneuver commander. The MCS tracks the calls for support and logistics task orders generated through FBCB2.  \n7-21. The MCO serves as maintenance officer for the supported battalion and FSC. MCOs are the senior \nmaintenance representative in the MCP and are responsible for managi ng the MCS, maintenance section, \nservice and recovery section, and the field maintena nce teams. The recovery section provides recovery \nsupport to elements of the FSC. This section also provides limited reinforcing recovery support to FMTs. \n7-22. The MCS controls and assigns work to the MCP. Task organization of the MCP’s maintenance \noperation is modified based on the MCO’s analysis of maintenance requirements and the tactical situation. \nEquipment that requires sustainment level maintenan ce is evacuated to a national level provider. This \nrequires coordination between the FSC MC S, brigade staff and the SPO staff.  \nField Maintenance Teams (FMT) \n7-23. The supported battalion’s first level of maintena nce support comes from the FSC FMTs that are \norganized to provide field maintenance for all combat  platforms in the supported unit. The FMTs provide \nfield maintenance and BDAR to maneuver companies. All or part of an FMT goes with the company teams. \n7-24. The supported company commander and the MCS se t the FMT’s priorities in accordance with the \nbattalion commander’s guidance. The FMT operates under the operational control of the maneuver company and is supervised by the FMT’s maintenance non-commissioned officer in  charge. FMTs are fully \nintegrated into the maneuver unit’s operational plans. \nForward Support Company  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 7-5 FMTs perform repairs as far forward as possible, returning equipment to the battle quickly. During combat, \nFMTs perform BDAR, diagnostics, and on-system replacement of line replaceable units. If the tactical \nsituation permits, FMTs focus on completing jobs on site. FMTs carry limited on board combat spares to \nfacilitate repairs forward. The FSC’s maintenance plat oon provides reinforcing maintenance to the FMTs. \nThis page intentionally left blank .  \n \n \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 8-1 Chapter 8 \nMission Command and Logistic Reporting \nBSB mission command is complex. The commander monitors and supports decisive \naction tasks across the brigade area of operations. BSB command posts, mission command systems and logistic information systems enable the BSB to efficiently \ninterface with others and conduct sustai nment operations. Accurate and timely \nreporting can mean the difference between  mission success and failure. The entire \nlogistical scheme only works when an accurate  logistic status is part of the common \noperating picture. Key logistic informa tion systems can assist with developing a \nlogistic common operating picture.  \nSECTION I – MISSION COMMAND \n8-1. Mission command  is the exercise of authority and direction by the commander using mission orders \nto enable disciplined initiative within the commander’s intent to empower agile and adaptive leaders in the \nconduct of unified land operations (ADP 6-0). Mission command is enabled through extracting information \nfrom multiple sources, personnel and processes. \nOPERATIONS PROCESS \n8-2. Both the commander and staff have important roles within the operations process. The commander’s \nrole is to drive the operations process through the activities of understanding, visualizing, describing, \ndirecting, leading, and assessing operations. The BSB commander visualizes the nature and design of \noperations through estimates and input from subordinates. The commander describes support operations in terms of time, space, resources, purpose, and actio n, employing intent, CCIR, and mission orders for \nplanning, preparation, and mission execution. \n8-3. The staff’s role is to assist commanders with understanding situations, making and implementing \ndecisions, controlling operations, and assessing progre ss. The BSB commander and staff must be familiar \nwith Army design methodology, the MDMP, and troop leading procedures. ADRP 5-0, The Operations \nProcess , and ATTP 5-0.1, Commanders and Staff Officer Guide , describe planning methodologies, as well \nas, the key components of a plan or order. \nINTEGRATING PROCESSES AND CONTINUING ACTIVITIES  \n8-4. The BSB commander and staff synchronize within the warfighting functions to accomplish missions \nthroughout the operations process. Synchronization  is the arrangement of actions in time, space and \npurpose to produce maximum relative combat power at a decisive place and time (JP 2-0). Integration  is \ncombining all of the elements of sustainment (task, functions, systems, processes, organizations) to \noperations assuring unity of command of effort (ADP 4-0). Before commanders can effectively \nsynchronize activities or events they must integrate activities. \n8-5. Integrating processes combine me mbers from across the staff to help synchronize operations. For \nexample, the MDMP fosters a shared understanding of the situation as it develops a synchronized plan or \norder to accomplish a mission. The MDMP not only in tegrates the actions of the commander, staff, \nsubordinate commanders and other but also integrates several processes such as intelligence preparation of \nthe battlefield, close air support and risk management. Commanders and staff integrate the warfighting \nfunction through command post cells. \nChapter 8  \n8-2 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 8-6. The BSB staff uses planning guidance to prep are estimates. The BSB commander and staff plan \ncontinuously. In an ambiguous environment, the commander's initial planning guidance should not limit the \nstaff's development of mission analysis and refinement of their running estimates. Each staff section should \nmaintain a continuous baseline of running estimates that can be modified based on the results of the mission analysis. Yet, it is not until they receive th e supported commander’s d ecision on the tactical \nemployment of brigade units that they finalize the concept of operations. Working with the brigade staff, \nthe BSB staff develops the logis tics and AHS concept of support. \n8-7. After reviewing running estimates, the commander offe rs personal estimates of the situation, reviews \nthe course of action analysis and decides the course of action that best supports the supported brigade’s \nmission. The process is a continuous one; the support battalion commander and staff are always involved in \nestimating and planning. However, the focus becomes more precise when the support battalion receives a \nmission. \nPLANNING  \n8-8. Using the brigade S-4’s requirements and the commande rs priorities, the BSB staff determines what \ntype, quantity and priority of logistics and AHS suppor t is required and available,  where these resources are \nlocated and when they are available to supported units. Such logistics and AHS support planning is as detailed as time permits. Planning concentrates on  those areas most vital to successful mission \naccomplishment of the supported brigade. Refer to ADRP 5-0, The Operations Process , for an explanation \nof the plans to operations transition and transition among staff integrating cells. \n8-9. One of the areas the BSB pays close attention to during the planning process is the command and \nsupport relationships established throughout the phase s of the operation. The command relationships drive \nthe units the BSB supports and those relationships change depending on the phase of a particular operation. ADRP 5-0, The Operations Process , and ATTP 5-0.1, Commanders and Staff Officer Guide , provide tables \nand text describing the different command and support relationships. \n8-10. The BSB commander’s intent, formalized in the order and understood at the company level provides \nsubordinates with the broad idea behind the operation an d allows them to act promptly as the situation \nrequires. Subordinate commanders focus their orders on the purpose of tasks and the operation as a whole \nrather than the detail. Orders and plan s are as brief and simple as possible. \n8-11. The concept of support is a verbal or graphi c statement of how the BSB commander intends to \nsupport and integrate BSB sustainment operations with a concept of operations in an operation. The broad \nconcept of support is paragraph four of the OPLAN/OPORD with subparagraphs for logistics, personnel \nand AHS support. However, more detailed information and instructions about the concept of support are \nfound in Annex F (Sustainment) of the OPLAN/OPORD. An example of a sustainment annex is in ATTP 5-0.1, Commander and Staff Officer Guide . \n8-12. After the current operations S3 distributes the OPLAN/OPORD, the BSB commander and staff \nsupervise its execution. The primary purpose of the staff is to assist subordinate units to carry out the intent of the support battalion commanders’ order. The BSB staff refines plans and orders as the situation \nchanges. Information comes back to the command section through reports and personal observations of the \nbattalion/company commanders and st aff. On the basis of this information, the BSB staff evaluates \ninstructions as required. \n8-13. Logistical and operational planning occurs simultaneously rather than sequentially. Incremental \nadjustments to either the maneuver or logistics plan during its execution must be visible to all supported brigade elements. Conduct adjustments to the logis tics plan during the brigad e sustainment rehearsal. \nFollowing the rehearsal, the BSB SPO and BSB S-3 re view additional planning guidance issued by the \ncommander and modify the plan as n ecessary. Significant changes may re quire assistance from the SPO to \ninclude moving someone to the S-3 cell until the changes are completed. The sustainment rehearsal should \nbe led by the BSB commander and the brigade XO. \n8-14. Participating in mission rehearsals and sand tabl e exercises are an excellent means to better \nunderstand the support requirements. Ideally, the BSB SPO briefs the concept of  support at the brigade \nmission rehearsal. This ensures all concerned understand the concept of support and have an opportunity to \nMission Command and Logistic Reporting  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 8-3 ask questions and clarify areas of confusion. Anticipatory logistics depends on a thorough understanding of \nthe mission requirements. The change from one type of operation to another, such as from a hasty attack to \na pursuit, does not require a major shift in logistic s plans and procedures. However, the priorities and \nrequirements for support may change.  \n8-15. The plans-to-operations transition is a preparation activity that occurs within the BSB headquarters. \nThis transition is especially important to the BSB SPO and the BSB S-3. The purpose of the transition is to \nensure both the BSB SPO and S-3 understand the plan prior to execution. The responsibility for developing and maintaining the plan shifts from the SPO (future operations) to the S-3 (current operations). This \ntransition is the point at which the S-3 becomes respon sible for controlling execution of the operation order. \nThis responsibility includes answering requests for in formation concerning the order and maintaining the \norder through fragmentary orders. The BSB SPO normally conducts a mission brief and allows time for the \nS-3 to understand the plan in order to coordinate the execution and to identify questions about the plan. \n8-16. The Operations Logistics (OPLOG) Planner is a web-based interactive tool that assists commanders \nand staff from strategic through operational levels in developing a logistics estimate. It is designed to \nsupport operations typically associated with multi-phase operations plans and orders. The OPLOG Planner enables staffs to develop estimated mission requirement s for supply class I, class II, class III(P), class IV, \nclass VI, class VII, class X, including water, ice, and ma il. The tool uses the latest Army approved planning \nrates and force structures. It is updated at least annu ally to stay current with force structure and rate \nchanges.  \n8-17. OPLOG Planner allows planners to build multiple task organizations from a preloaded list of units \nand equipment or from custom built units that are generated or imported. The planners have the option of using predefined default planning rates or customizing rates based on what a unit is experiencing. OPLOG \nPlanner generates the logistics supply requirements which can be viewed in a variety of ways. Logistics \nrequirement reports can be printed or exported to auto mated spread sheets for further analysis or saved for \nrecall to be used in course of action analysis. \nCOMMAND POSTS (CP) \n8-18. There are three types of command post; main co mmand post, tactical command post and early entry \ncommand post. The main command post  consists of the majority of the staff. They control current \noperations, conduct detailed analysis and plan future operations (ATTP 5-0.1). The tactical command post  \ncontains a tailored portion of a unit headquarter desi gned to control portions of an operation for a limited \ntime (ATTP 5-0.1). An early entry command post  is the lead element of a head quarters designed to control \noperations until the remainder of the headquarters are operational (ATTP 5-0.1). The BSB is staffed for a \nmain CP. Resourcing for additional command posts would be from the existing brigade support battalion \npositions. This is a critical point to remember since the BSB CP does not have the organic capability to \nmission command on the move, they lose many capabilit ies they have when stationary. The BSB should \nestablish procedures to transfer command post control responsibilities to another CP during moves. Refer to \nATTP 5-0.1, Commander and Staff Officer Guide , for more information about command posts. \nCOMMAND POST OPERATIONS  \n8-19. Some key functions in any CP include orders ma nagement, running estimates and establishing a \ndeliberate process for information flow. These are especially important to maintaining situational \nunderstanding of the distribution operations for the supported brigade. There are a lot of people involved in sustainment operations that may not be in the BSB or even in the supported brigade.  The commander and \nstaff should also consider the role of any liaison staff elements; if the liaison will be in the CP, the tasks the \ncommander expects the liaison to do and if the liaison officers require access to the local area network or \npower. The commander may also consider if the BSB should send any liaisons from the BSB to other \norganizations. \n8-20. The staff must communicate any activity that imp acts sustainment operations. As part of command \npost operations, the staff roles include gathering and analyzing information and making recommendations \nto the commander. C ommander’s critical information requirement is an information requirement identified \nby the commander as being critical to facilitating timely decision making (ADRP 1-02). The staff \nChapter 8  \n8-4 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 determines what information is important and how quickly it must be conveyed to the commander. ADRP \n5-0, The Operations Process,  provides description of CCIR and the two categories of commander’s critical \ninformation requirements; priority intelligence requirem ents and friendly force information requirements. \nSome things the BSB staff can do to  improve sustainment support are- \n Identify assumptions that affect the sustainment function or the BSB unit and develop CCIR \nrelated to those assumptions.  \n Develop means of observation or reporting to track CCIR. \n Issue and execute fragmentary or ders in response to CCIR. \n8-21. Sound SOPs and contingency plans greatly assist in the development of specific plans. When SOPs \nare comprehensive, they have to change only to accommodate specific requireme nts or circumstances. The \nBSB’s SOP should complement the supported brigade’s SOP. Some areas that th e BSB’s CP SOP should \ninclude are standard CP layout, battle drills, battle rhythm, communications, reporting procedures and \nreport formats. The most successf ul units follow and revise SOPs throughout training and mission \nexecution.  \n8-22. Effective CP operations require frequent training th at includes establishing and practicing staff battle \ndrills. The number and sophistication of BSB staff battle dr ills vary by organization. They are as diverse as \nthe personalities of the BSB commande rs. A useful battle drill is a BSB CP displacement drill that directs \nhow to displace the CP within established time periods, 12 hour notice, 24 hour notice, or 48 hour notice. Battle drills only work when everyone associated with  the CP understands and practices the drills. Battle \ndrills can be trained and practiced in a variety of locations.  \n8-23. The commander considers the size, location and mobility requirements of the CP and then configures \nthe command post. An example BSB command post layout is depicted in figure 8-1. This example uses \nequipment that is authorized by modified table of organization and equipment or common table of \nallowances. Commanders may add or take equipmen t and space away depending on the factors of METT-\nTC variables.  \nFigure 8-1. Example brigade support battalion CP \n8-24. Keep in mind, the more complicated  the CP design, the longer it will take to set-up and displace. CP \nmobility improves CP survivability, especially at the company and battalion level. A smaller size and \ncareful transportation planning allow CPs to displace rapidly to avoid the enemy. \n8-25. There are multiple work areas in the exampl e BSB CP. Many commanders display critical \ninformation on boards or other visual means. Some topics that could be displayed in the battle staff area \n\nMission Command and Logistic Reporting  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 8-5 are: priority information requirements, CCIR, CBRN conditions, various personnel or logistic status \nreports, concept of support, battle rhythm, orders, and a synch matrix.  \nCOMMAND POST CELLS  \n8-26. Most CP functions directly relate to assessi ng and directing ongoing operations, planning future \noperations or supporting the force. To promote coordination and synchronization, commanders cross-functionally organize elements of staff sections in command posts and CP cells. The BSB staff was \ndesigned to allow for cross-functionality inter-action between the staff sections.  \n8-27. While each echelon and type of unit organizes CPs di fferently, two types of CP cells exist: functional \nand integrating cells. Functional cells group personnel  and equipment by war fighting function. Integrating \ncells group personnel and equipment by planning hori zon. Staff interactions will change as operations \nevolve and task organize as the operations dictate. \n8-28. The XO normally leads and provides staff supervision of the CP. ATTP 5-0.1, Commander and Staff \nOfficer Guide , includes information about command post organization, operations and functional and \nintegrating CP cells. \n8-29. The BSB receives joint network node support from the brigade signal company. The brigade \nallocates joint network node resources according to METT-TC. The BSB’s co mbat service support \nautomated information systems interf ace is used to set up wireless local area networks from the BSB to its \nsupporting brigade and sustainment organizations. It connects all logistics information systems, including \nthose used by maneuver units. This means that any unit in the BSA will be able to use the Internet.  \n8-30. The Combat Service Support Very Small Aperture Terminal System is a satellite communications \nsystem designed to provide worldwide data and voice communications connectivity. The BSB’s Very \nSmall Aperture Terminal System provides the means to establish connectivity, constant communication and access to the non-classified internet  protocol router netw ork from any location where a satellite signal can \nbe transmitted and received. \nDIGITIZED MISSION COMMAND SYSTEMS  \n8-31. A mission command system is the arrangement of personnel, information management, procedures, \nand equipment and facilities essential for the commander to conduct operations. Commanders cannot \nexercise mission command alone except in the simplest  and smallest of units. Even at the lowest levels, \ncommanders need support to  exercise mission command effectively.  At every echelon of command, each \ncommander has a mission command system to prov ide support. Digitized mission command systems \nprovide data and facilitate situational understanding by establishing a common operating picture (COP).  \n8-32. Logisticians, human resources and AHS support personnel draw on actionable data provided by \nmission command warfighting function system platforms to determine the sustainability and supportability \nof current and planned operations. These systems provide near real time logistics, human resource, and medical information that link the BCT to the sustainm ent brigade and theater planners. These systems also \nenable staff officers and commande rs to quickly and more accurate ly plan logistics operations.  \n8-33. Effective BSB logistics operations are dependent on a high level of situational understanding. \nSituational understanding enables the BSB commander and staff to maintain visibility of current and \nprojected requirements, to synchronize distribution op erations and to maintain integrated visibility of \ntransportation and supplies. Logistic ians maintain situational understanding of the battlefield via Battle \nCommand Sustainment Support System (BCS3), analog systems, and improvised redundant digital systems \nsuch as Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) Blue Force Tracker, Movement Tracking \nSystem, Command Post of the Future, and non-classified internet protocol router or secret internet protocol router. These systems enable sustainment commanders and battle staffs to exercise centralized mission \ncommand warfighting function tasks, anticipate support requirements, and maximize battlefield \ndistribution. \n8-34. Logisticians manage the destination, speed, and volume of the distribution system. With in-transit \nvisibility, total asset visibility, advanced materiel management, and advanced decision support system \ntechnology, logisticians have access to and visibility over all items within the distribution system. This \nChapter 8  \n8-6 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 enables a logisticians ability to divert, cross-level, and mass assets anywhere, anytime to support the \nmaneuver commander.  \nBattle Command Sustainment Support System (BCS3) \n8-35. BCS3 receives data from logistics information sy stems (including GCSS-A rmy (F/T)), other BCS3 \nterminals, other Army Battle Command System devices including FBCB2, and manual input by operators. \nUsers of BCS3 are able to obtain mission command information (such as the friendly and enemy situations) \nfrom other Army Battle Command System devices. Sim ilarly, other Army Battle Command System devices \nare able to view the same friendly logistics status as are on BCS3. This enab les all Army Battle Command \nSystem users to maintain a logistics COP.  \n8-36. The BCS3 Logistics Reporting Tool provides a bottoms-up logistics status input to the BCT \ncommander’s BCS3 combat power report and populates the dashboard of a Command Post of the Future \nworkstation. The BCS3 Logistics Reporting Tool incorporates repair parts and supply status starting at the \ncompany level. The intent of BCS3 is to identify sh ortages at the lowest level first then project the \nrequirement to the next higher command and the support unit. The Logistics Reporting Tool format \nincorporates organizational and direct support data on the same report to enable logisticians to fix issues at \nthe lowest levels. The Logistics Reporting Tool enab les users to input and access data locally. Information \nabout BCS3 and sample Logistics Reporting Tool and combat power reports are available in the BCS3 \nusers or operators manual. \n8-37. The BCS3 combat power tool shows asset readiness by user-specified class of supply and tracked \nitems list. The combat power report also allows the user to switch between logistics information systems \n(LIS) such as Standard Army Retail Supply System, Standard Army Ammunition System, and GCSS-Army \n(F/T), input and more timely and accurate Logistic s Reporting Tool logistics status. These commodity \nreports are available in BCS3 for all classes of supply  with an automated source of data. These require no \nadditional reporting on the part of the user, other than their daily transactions on the LIS. Additional reports \nsuch as the maintenance readiness report, munitions report and petroleum report should not be added to \nreporting requirements to subordinate units below divi sion-level if LIS and Logis tics Reporting Tool satisfy \ninformation requirements. \nForce XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2)  \n8-38. FBCB2 forms the principal digital mission command system for the Army at brigade and below. \nFBCB2 systems hardware and software are integrated in to various platforms at brigade and below, as well \nas appropriate division and corps elements necessary  to support brigade operations. All FBCB2 systems are \ninterconnected through a communications infrastructure to exchange data which improves situational \nunderstanding. This data exchange enhances the commander’s ability to conduct mission command warfighting function tasks. \n8-39. FBCB2, positioned on specified platforms, performs combat, combat service, and logistics functions \nfor the planning and execution of operations. Logistics organizations are digitally linked to the platforms and organizations that they support. FBCB2 provides a COP enabling logistics providers to maintain the \noperational tempo set by maneuver commanders.  \n8-40. FBCB2 assists lower level commanders to automate the sustainment data-gathering process. It does \nthis through logistics situation reports, personnel situatio n reports, logistical call for support, logistics task \norder messaging, and task management. This functionality affects the synchronization of all logistics \nsupport on the battlefield between the supported and the supporter.  \nSECTION II – LOGISTIC REPORTING \n8-41. The intent of this section is to address the following frequently asked questions:  \n What is a logistic status report? \n Who reports logistic information? \n What information is reported? \n What is the distribution of reports? \nMission Command and Logistic Reporting  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 8-7  What is the frequency of reports? \n Who is responsible for acting on information? \n8-42. Logistic status reports are detailed enough to be useful but simple enough for everyone to prepare \nand understand. Logistic reporting can easily become  an overwhelming task for the staff and result in \ninformation overload for the brigade commander. Report s may be in different formats, but every leader \nmust know the status of equipment and of on hand supplies particularly ammunition, food and fuel. In order \nto provide support, BSB commanders, in  conjunction with the brigade S-4, use a logistics status report to \ncoordinate with supporting and supported units. The logistics status report enables the higher command and support units to make timely decisions, prioritize, cr oss level and synchronize the distribution of supplies to \nsustain units at their authorized levels. \n8-43. The logistics status report is an internal status report that identifies logistics requirements, provides \nvisibility on critical shortages, allows commanders an d staff to project mission capability, and informs the \ncommon operating picture. Accurately reporting the logistic and AHS support status is essential for keeping units combat ready. Brigade SOPs establish report formats, reporting times, and redundancy requirements.  \n8-44. The logistics status report is the primary product used throughout the brigade and at higher levels of \ncommand to provide a logistics snapshot of current stock status, on-hand quantities, and future requirements. The logistics status report is a compila tion of data that requires analysis before action. \nProviding the commander a bunch of numbers with percentages and colors is useless. The commander \nrequires an analysis based on the data along with a recommendation for action.  \n8-45. The brigade commander’s pr eferences and the mission determine wh at the logistics status report \nlooks like and what it contains. The logistics status re port is customizable to the commander’s preferences \nand does not have to come from an LIS. The format presented to the commander must be easy to understand and act on.  \n8-46. Data collection for the logistics status report is based upon operational and mission variables and \nshould not overwhelm subordinate units with submission requirements. A report that grows too cumbersome will overwhelm staffs and fail in a high operational pace. It is important that this report is \nstandardized throughout the brigade and that all units co nsistently provide input, regardless of their level of \nsupport. The brigade S-4 decides the logistics status report format ensuring the data the BSB requires is included. In some cases, the higher level S-4 will determin e the logistics status report format. It’s important \nto note, the brigade tracks the higher level requirements as well as the brigade commander’s requirements.  \n8-47. The data requested and subsequently analyzed should be linked to CCIR and priority information \nrequirements. Some possible details to include in a logistics report are gallons of fuel on hand and projected \nusage, class I and water status, changes to anticipated  expenditure rates, class V status, and any incident \nhaving significant impact on the operational capability of a logistics unit or logistical posture of any tactical \nunit. Capturing the status of weapons systems and cr itical equipment is also necessary. Some commanders \ntrack special event meals or status of critical low density equipment. Reported metric criteria such as \npercentages or colors must be clearly defined. The BSB may include information such as LIS connectivity \nstatus, route and transportation node status, and distribution platform capabilities.  \n8-48. The frequency of a logistics status report varies. Normally a status report is completed daily, but \nduring periods of increased intensity the commander may require status updates more frequently. As long \nas automation is available, logistic status relaye d via near-real time automa tion provides the commander \nwith the most up to date data. Some examples of logis tic reports are: daily logistic status reports, logistic \nspot reports and daily maintenance status reports.  \n8-49. The logistics status report can be completed manually or using BCS3. Although mission command \nsystems make capturing and disseminating data and info rmation easier and faster, the staff’s focus is the \nintegrity and usability of the data by commanders and pl anners. However the logistics report is completed, \nthe same data must be reported using the same measurements.  \n8-50. The organization’s battle rhythm is critical when considering report cut off times, as of times, and \nreporting times. Automated feeds will offer near real  time, but if a unit is consolidating information \nmanually, they will have to determine cut off times and reporting times to synchronize with the rest of the \nbrigade. If logistics updates are part of the brigade co mmanders daily battle rhythm the logistics reporting \nChapter 8  \n8-8 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 times should be as current as possible to provide the commander with the best status. It is important to \nallow enough time to analyze the data in order to provide the commander with a considered \nrecommendation on future  courses of action. \n8-51. Once completed, reports are forwarded from a unit to its higher headquarters and its supporting \nlogistics headquarters. Normally logistics status reports flow through S-4 channels. The BSB and its \nsubordinate units report both unit on hand supply and supply point on hand quantities. The BCT staff has \nan interest in both reports, as does the supporting sustainment unit.  \n8-52. It is important that these two groups of supplies are accounted for separately  and reported accurately. \nUnit on hand supplies are those items that are for BSB internal consumption. Supply point items are those \nitems that are for distribution to the BCT, including the BSB.  \n8-53. The command relationship of units within the brigade determines who reports to whom. Although \nthe unit SOP should address how attached or OPCON elements within the brigade are to report their \nlogistic status, mission orders must delineate relations hips and reporting requirements. Normally logistics \nreporting parallels logistical support responsibility, but this may change throughout the mission. Lack of \nclarity could result in a unit getting too much or not eno ugh of a critical class of su pply or in unnecessarily \ntasking valuable distribution assets. \n8-54. For example, the FSC is organic to the BSB and could submit its logistics status report to the BSB S-\n4. However, if the FSC is attached to its supported battalion, the attachment orders could state the FSC submits its logistics status report to its supported battalion S-4. The supported battalion S-4 would cross \nlevel supplies within the battalion, adjust the battalion lo gistics status report and forward to the brigade S-4. \nThe same logic applies to any attached unit.  \n8-55. Action is required at every level. Leaders at all le vels analyze the logistics status report and forecast \nrequirements based on current balances and upcoming mission requirements. Once logistics information is \ngathered, a leader may cross level materiel within the organization. For example, a unit first sergeant would \ncross level supplies within a company, the battalion S-4 cross levels supplies with the battalion. The \nbattalion S-4 submits a consolidated report to the brigade S-4.  \n8-56. The BSB S-4 collects reports from its subordinate units. The battalion S-4, with the SPO and XO’s \nconcurrence, determines which BSB units receive de signated supplies from the BSB supply po int. That \ndecision is based on mission priority and the battalion commander’s guidance. BSB units are resupplied \nand the logistics status report is  forwarded to the brigade S-4. \n8-57. The brigade S-4 receives the logistic s status report from all subordin ate units. The brigade S-4, with \nthe brigade XO’s concurrence, determines which units receive designated supplies and shares that \ninformation with the BSB SPO. The BSB SPO acknowledg es required supply actions per the brigade S-4, \nsynchronizes distribution, updates th e supply point on hand status and forecasts resupply requirements for \nthe brigade. The logistic status report is updated with the BSB supply points adjusted balances and forecasted requirements. The BSB SPO forwards the entire report to the brig ade S-4 and provides a \ncourtesy copy to the suppor ting sustainment brigade SPO. \n \n \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 A-1 Appendix A \nSustainment Echelons  \nSupporting the BCT is a carefully planned and executed process. The BSB must plan \nfor, and synchronize echelon support, which is the method of supporting an \norganization arrayed within an area of operation .  Common echelon support at \nthe lowest level of sustainment is execu ted at the company and battalion echelon. \nA-1. How the BCT support organizations, including task organized units, are arrayed in echelons can vary \nwidely based upon mission variables. The current mission, task organization, concept of support, and \nterrain influence how the support is echeloned.   \nA-2. The method employed to echelon support is a deliberate, collaborative decision based upon thorough \nmission analysis and the military decision making process.  This is conducted by the leadership and staffs at \nthe brigade, battalion, and company levels. It must never be a unilateral decision by a single commander since the entire brigade operation will be impacted by the effectiveness of echeloned support.   \nA-3. There must be a thorough understanding at all leve ls of the capabilities of each  support organization. \nCommanders of all brigade organizations must understand that echeloned support will vary for the brigade \nand may even vary by each battalion for a single operation. The BSB is organized to facilitate echeloned \nsupport. The FSCs are a key element in echeloned support.   \nCOMPANY ECHELON \nA-4. Echeloning of support begins at the maneuver company level. The maneuver companies within the \nBCT have no organic logistics organizations. Echeloning of support within a company, if required, must be \naccomplished by task organizi ng personnel and equipment used to facilitate or expedite logistics support \nwithin the company.  \nA-5. The composition of the company echelon of suppor t, often referred to as company trains, is \ndetermined by the company commander and may consist of the company first serg eant, supply sergeant, \nand company medical assets. Maintenance teams from the FSC may be included.  \nA-6. The company echelon expedites repl enishment of company elements using either the supply point \ndistribution or the unit distribution method. The method used must be described in the mission orders. \nDepending on the distribution method used the first sergeant may send company personnel and vehicles to a supply point designated by the FSC (supply point distribution) or the first sergeant may coordinate for \nsupplies to be delivered to a company or platoon location (unit distribution) by the FSC.   \nA-7. Within the company, the first sergeant will replenish company elements using various methods \ndepending on the situation. Company elements may move from their positions to the designated site to be \nfed, to resupply, to turn in damaged equipment. This is  often referred to as service station technique. It is \nnormally used in assembly areas and when contact is not likely. It takes the least amount of time for the \nsustainers. \nA-8. Conversely, the first sergeant may use company pe rsonnel and vehicles to go to each element to \nreplenish them. Soldiers can remain in position when using this method. It is the most lengthy resupply \nmethod and may compromise friendly pos itions. This is often referred to as  tailgate technique or in-position \nresupply. \nBATTALION ECHELON \nA-9. Each maneuver battalion in the BCT is supported by an FSC. Battalions in the support brigades also \nhave supporting FSCs. The FSC forms the battalion echelon of support, often referred  to as battalion trains. \nAppendix A  \nA-2 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 The maneuver battalion commander and staff, the BSB commander and staff, and the FSC commander \nmust collaborate to determine the best method of employment commensurate with the brigade concept of \nsupport.   \nA-10.  FSC employment considerations include: \n FSC location in relation to the supported battalion. \n Decision to separate elements of the FSC by platoon or other sub-elements into multiple \nlocations.   \n Benefits of locating FSC elements in the brigade support area.   \n Benefits of collocating battalion staff sections with the FSC.  \n Benefits of collocating battalion medical elements with the FSC. \n Security of the FSC locations.  \n Establishment and location of a maintenance collection point (MCP). \nA-11.  If the battalion commander determines the need to establish a combat trains command post \nconsideration should be given to the organization best suited to assume these tasks under the current \nsituation. The FSC headquarters or someone from the battalion HHC may be tasked with combat trains \ncommand post responsibilities. The senior Soldier from the FSC is responsible to lead FSC soldiers and \nensure the FSC mission is accomplished. \nSustainment elements must organize and prepare to defend themselves against ground or air attacks. \nAlthough they often occupy areas that maneuver elem ents of the BCT have secured, there is still a \nrequirement to protect against the threat of enemy activity. The senior leader within the FSC is responsible \nfor the security of FSC Soldiers and activities at every location. The senior leader must nest the FSC local \ndefense plan within the overall defensive plan if located within another unit's perimeter. \nFORWARD LOGISTICS ELEMENT  \nA-12.  A forward logistics element  (FLE) is comprised of task-organiz ed multifunctional logistics assets \ndesigned to support fast-moving offensive operations in the early phases of decisive action. The FLE \noperates out of a forward logistics base or support area.  The FLE represents the BSB commander’s ability \nto weight the effort for the operation by drawing on all sustainment assets across the brigade. Additionally, \nthe BSB commander may coordinate with echelons above brigade to provide support capabilities to \naugment the FLE in the concept of support. This incl udes identifying and the positioning of echelons above \nbrigade unit assets in prox imity to geographically di spersed forces to extend operational reach and prolong \nendurance. The intent for employing a FLE is to minimize tactical pauses to the offensive plan and enable \nmomentum for the commander. \n \n \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 B-1 Appendix B \nBrigade Support Area \nThe BSA is a designated area in which sustainment elements locate to provide \nsupport to a brigade. It is an area recommended by the BSB commander, and established by the brigade commander as the b est location in which to support the \nbrigade. \nB-1. The BSA is the sustainment hub of the suppor ted brigade. The brigade commander approves the \nlocation of the BSA based upon recommendations from the BSB commander and brigade staff. The BSB \ncommander’s goal is to retain overall freedom of action for fighting military operations. All elements within the BSB, especia lly company commanders and first sergeants  must ensure that they consider \nsecurity in all of their operations. \nB-2. The BSA should be located so that it best supports BCT operations and does not interfere with the \ntactical movement of BCT units, or with units that must pass through the BCT area. Usually the BSA is on \nan MSR and ideally is out of the range of the enemy’s medium artillery.  \nB-3. There is a constant balancing of support and security. The BSB commander is simultaneously \nsupporting the BCT which is conducting offensive, defensive, and stability tasks while ensuring BSA \nsecurity. All these activities must be integrated so that the timing multiplies their effectiveness throughout the BCT area of operations and doesn’t degrade the br igades’ combat effectiveness. The commander must \nensure logistics missions and associated activities continue without restriction and that all logistics units \ncan perform protection operati ons against a level 1 threat. \nB-4. In addition to its relationship to the brigade, the BSB has terrain management and security \nresponsibilities. Unless otherwise stated by OPORD, it has operational control over units located within the \nBSA and responsibility for the security of the BSA. Exact responsibilities will be determined by OPORD or \nfragmentary order from the brigade S-3 who has overall staff responsibility for the security of the brigade. \nBSA LAYOUT \nB-5. Normally, the BSA includes the BSB HHC and subord inate companies including all or part of the \nFSCs. In addition to the BSB, the BSA could also include elements from the BCT staff, the brigade \nalternate CP, brigade engineer battalion units, sign al assets, and sustainment units from higher \nheadquarters. Depending on factors of METT-TC, there could also be el ements from the U. S. Materiel \nCommand present in the BSA such as the brigade logistics support team or a contingency contracting team. \nB-6. The composition of BSA elements will not remain static. The brigade commander could place \nattached elements in the BSA. Additional medical elements, decontamination elements or even a joint \nelement may surge for a particular mission and subsequently depart. The advantages and disadvantages of \nthese placements must be considered with the u ltimate decision on placement made by the brigade \ncommander. \nB-7. If the BSA changes location, some elements ma y not relocate to the new BSA or the BSA may \ninclude additional elements. Whenever possible, units should occupy the same location within the BSA \nrelative to the other units every time the BSA moves, or units can use several st andard configurations for \nease of transition. \nB-8. The BSB commander must be able to track and contro l changes. To accomplish this, all ground units \nentering the brigade area must send a representativ e to report to the BSB CP. They will coordinate \nmovement routes, positioning for units locating in the BSA, communications, support requirements and procedures, and security responsibilities. Guards at access control points going in to the BSA will direct \nrepresentatives of entering units to the CP. Also, unit commanders will notify the CP of all support package \narrivals and departures. Movement of displaced civilians and local civilians must also be controlled. \nAppendix B  \nB-2 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 B-9. Locations of elements within the BSA will vary depending on mission variables. The BSB \ncommander and S-3 must use their best judgment in positioning units. If the BSA is too large or the terrain \nis limited, BSB subordinate companies could be extern al to the BSA perimeter. Troop safety guidelines \nalso influence unit placement. The ATHP is often ou tside the BSA due to size and explosive distance \nfactors. \nB-10.  In addition to staff elements and units, there are supply points associated with the BSA. The \ndistribution company has an SSA, a fuel point and an ATHP. The field maintenance company sets up maintenance areas and the BSMC es tablishes treatment facilities. If the sustainment brigade provides \ntransportation or water support they will al so need space for a water poi nt and truck parking.  \nB-11.  Some points to consider- \n If all or part of the FSCs locate in the BSA, it’s best to position them so they are closer to their \nsupported battalions and near an MSR with convenient access to the BSB supply points. \n Make supply points accessible to both customers and resupply vehicles and helicopters. Keep \nclass III points away from other supplies to prevent contamination. They should also be located at least 100 feet from water sources.  \n Locate the medical treatment areas away from likely  target areas (ATHP, class III point, bridges, \nand road junctions) but near evacuation routes and an open area for landing air ambulances. \n Position the ATHP near, but off the MSR, so that echelon above brigade trailers bringing \nammunition into the area do not clog up the MS R or the BSA. The ATHP requires sufficient \narea to perform transload operations w ithout interfering w ith BSA traffic. \n Position CPs near the center of the BSA perimete r for mission command and security reasons. \n Position units with heaviest firepower, such as the maintenance company, along the most \nthreatening avenues of approach. \nBSA PROTECTION \nB-12.  The BSB commander’s responsibility for protectio n includes BSA defense planning, perimeter \ndefense, and extends to convoys and other logistics ac tions occurring outside of the BSA. Commanders and \nstaffs must plan for and coordinate protection for subordinate units and detachments located away from the \nheadquarters. Tactical sustainment or ganizations are normally the units l east capable of self-defense against \nan enemy force. They are also ofte n the targets of enemy action. As th e threat increases, unit commanders \ncannot decrease sustainment operations in favor of enhancing protection. The supported commander and \nthe sustainment unit commander must have previously discussed what risks are reasonable to accept and \nwhat risk mitigation measures they should implement based on requirements and priorities, including force \nhealth protection. ADRP 3-37, Protection , offers relevant information about the supporting tasks of \nprotection, protection planning, and protection execution.   \nB-13.  Logisticians and unit commanders must be competent in warfighting, military decision-making, \nmaneuver, and other tactical skills to anticipate and decide on appropriate risk mitigation measures. While \nthe BSB S-3 is overall responsible for developing the BSA security plan, the BSB S-2 assists by developing the information collection plan to support security operations in and around the BSA. The BSB commander \nuses intelligence to determine the most probable direction of enemy attack and then concentrates forces to \ncover that approach. Patrolling outside the perimete r and interviewing newcomers to the BSA are some \nways to collect information which can then be analyzed for intelligence value. \nB-14.  All elements in, or transiting the area, assist w ith forming and defending the perimeter. Based on \nmission and terrain analyses, the BSB S-3 subdivides th e area and assigns subordinate and tenant units to \nthose subdivided areas. BSA security follows the impera tives of all security. When a particular supply point \nis sufficiently large, it will be assigned its own area for defense and a security force will be attached to \nprovide protection. Commanders and staffs must plan for and coordinate protection for subordinate units and detachments located away from the headquarters. \nB-15.  The perimeter shape conforms to the terrain features that best use friendly observation and fields of \nfire. The commander can increase the effectiveness of th e perimeter by tying it into a natural obstacle, such \nas a river, which allows him/her to concentrate comb at power in more threatened areas or operations.  \nBrigade Support Area  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 B-3 B-16.  BSB commanders position forces and plan fire and movement so they can respond to the widest \npossible range of enemy actions. The BSB staff prepares  plans, including countera ttack plans, which should \nbe rehearsed, evaluated, and revised as needed. The commander coordinates direct and indirect fire plans. \nNormally, the quick response force cent rally locates to react to a penetration of the perimeter at any point. \nB-17.  The BSB’s tactical SOP covers as many defense pr ocedures as possible. The shape and size of the \ndefensive perimeter depends on mission variables, m eaning the perimeter does not necessarily coincide \nwith the boundaries of the ar ea assigned to the BSB. In anticipation of the need for quick  reaction force or \ntactical combat forces, the S-3 develops and rehearses procedures to hand-off the battle to arriving quick \nreaction force, military police response forces, and tactical combat forces.  \nB-18.  The BSB S-3 assigns a perimeter area to each unit in the BSA. The S-3 ensures each unit’s area of \nfire mutually supports the adjacent unit’s area, when feasible. The S- 3 coordinates with unit commanders \nand confirms that units in the BSA have coordinated th eir boundaries of fire with  their adjacent units. The \nS-3 section must synchronize direct and indirect fires, obstacles, patrols, observation posts, and sensors to \nmitigate levels I, II, and III threats use of avenues of approach and infiltration lanes. The defensive plan \nshows unit protection responsibilities, locations of mi nes and obstacles, planned indirect fire coverage, \nobservation posts, listening posts, patrol routes, and positions of automatic and anti-armor weapons.  \nB-19.  Personnel available for defense actions may be limited within certain units. Unit commanders must \nkeep the BSB S-3 informed of their situations. This is  particularly true for the BMSC and elements of the \nFSCs that are in the BSA. The FSCs are focused forw ard on their supported battalion and may not always \nbe available for BSA security. This is another area th at requires the BSB commander and S-3 to review the \nrisks associated with each course of action. \nB-20.  The commander may consider using weapon systems that are in the shop for repair if qualified \noperators are available. If the firing system is operable, these weapons should be included in the BSA \ndefensive scheme, and mechanics should work on them in their fighting positions. Since night vision devices are not always available, illumination plans must also be included in the overall BSA security plan. \nB-21.  The BSA defense plan must be integrated into the pl an for the entire brigade ar ea of operation. This \nrequires that the BSB staff coordinate with the brig ade S-3 for the overall plan. This coordination should \ninclude the brigade engineer coordinator to ensure integration of engineer support and class IV materiel to \nharden positions and reduce the effectiveness of enemy weapon systems.  \nB-22.  The BSB staff must also coordinate directly with staffs of units in areas adjacent to or close to the \nBSB to plan mutually supporting fires and to prevent firing upon each other. This entire defensive \nperimeter planning effort must be replicated for protection of logistics elements that operate or move \noutside of the BSB’s specifically assigned area. \n \nThis page intentionally left blank .  \n \n \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 C-1 Appendix C \nLegacy Stryker Brigade Support Battalion \nThe SBCT is an early entry force, designed for rapid deployment and to conduct \nsmall scale contingencies. The Stryker brigade combat team is ideally suited for early entry operations where support infrastructure is limited or absent but where a relatively powerful, lethal, and flexible comb at force is required. The SBCT consists \nof three Stryker infantry battalions; a r econnaissance, surveillance, and target \nacquisition squadron; a field artillery battali on; a brigade engineer battalion, and a \nbrigade support battalion. The legacy SBCT BSB does not have forward support companies. This appendix is intended to address support organiza tions and operations \nthat are unique to the legacy SBCT BSB.  \nC-1. The Stryker brigade combat team is designed to allow increased capabilities through scalability. \nFigure C-1 shows how the Stryker brigade combat team is organized.  \nFigure C-1. Stryker brigade combat team \nC-2. The SBCT BSB contains a headquarters and headqua rters company, a distri bution company, a field \nmaintenance company and a medical company. It does not contain FSCs, so it task-organizes to provide \nsupport to each maneuver unit in the SBCT. The field maintenance company contains five combat repair \nteams that are designed to support each of the maneuver and fire battalions in the SBCT. The headquarters \ncompany contains six field feeding teams designed to  support each battalion, including the BSB. The BSB \nin a Stryker brigade will further tailor logistics assets to support separate companies. Figure C-2 on page C-\n2 depicts a Stryker brigade combat team support battalion. \nC-3. The Stryker BSB may use temporary task-organized logistic support teams allocated to maneuver \nunits. Logistic support teams are METT-TC dependant and used to support the commander’s intent, to \nreduce the amount of supplies and equipment in the BSA, and to provide maneuver units with logistics assets to support battalion-level operations. As a rule, logistic support teams are allocated to maneuver units \nto perform supply distribution, transportation, and food service to support that unit.  If one unit has priority \nfor support over another based on METT-TC factors and the SBCT commander’s intent, it may be \nnecessary to mix, combine, or shift assets from the BS B, logistic support team, or combat repair team to \nanother to support mission requirement. The preferred solution is to provide surge maintenance capability from within the assets of the BSB, but in some cases that may not be the most efficient or effective way to \nsupport the task force. \n\nAppendix C  \nC-2 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 Figure C-2. Brigade support battalion within SBCT \nC-4. The SBCT field maintenance company has three plat oons: a maintenance control platoon, a wheeled \nvehicle maintenance (often referred to as the automotive platoon) and a maintenance support platoon. The \nSBCT also has combat repair teams. Refer to unit authorization documents for exact type and quantities of assigned equipment. Exact configurations of companies vary from command to command depending on \nMETT-TC. For example, some units consolidate the ma intenance control section,  shop officer, and the \nservice and recovery section in the company headqu arters. See figure C-3 fo r an example of a field \nmaintenance company. \nFigure C-3. Field maintenance company (SBCT) \nC-5. The field maintenance company commander mission commands all personnel assigned or attached to \nthe company. One of the company commander’s chief responsibilities is to execute the BSB commanders’ maintenance plan in support of the SPO concept of support. The company commander manages task \norganization and employment of all maintenance assets to include Stryker combat repair team missions and \n\nLegacy Stryker Brigade Support Battalion  \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 C-3 recovery assets. He executes the mission according to the SPO’s concept of support and any additional \norders. The commander is normally located in the BSA but will always be where he can best command \nSoldiers and execute the mission. The commande r provides information and advice concerning \nmaintenance operations throughout the BSA to the BS B commander, support opera tions staff, the brigade \nengineer battalion and the brigade headquarters. \nC-6. The field maintenance company provides dedicated field maintenance on an area basis to the BSB \nunits as well as limited support to the FSCs, combat repair teams and supported maneuver battalions. The field maintenance company also re tains maintenance capabilities in the BSA since certain pieces of test \nequipment are not easily transportable. The field maintenance company provides field maintenance on \nweapons, power generation and other equipment assigned to the BCT headquarters, the brigade engineer battalion, the BSB and, on an area basis, for units op erating in the BSA. The field maintenance company \nprovides field maintenance to the brigade’s miss ile and electronic equipment/weapon systems for those \nbattalions that don’t have the capability. \nC-7. The SBCT field maintenance company has a wheeled  vehicle repair platoon that provides the \ncapabilities for automotive repair of wheeled vehicles. The wheeled vehicle repair platoon provides field maintenance for the organic wheeled vehicles in the S BCT and all supported units within the BSA. It is \nmanaged by the maintenance control section. The wheeled vehicle repair platoon also provides limited \nmaintenance to the forward combat repair teams.  The wheeled vehicle repair platoon performs \ntroubleshooting, minor (nonstructural) welding, major and secondary component replacement, wheel \nassembly, and line replaceable unit replacement as  part of its replace forward concept.  \nC-8. The SBCT field maintenance company has five comb at repair teams that are dispatched to the \nforward locations of the infantry battalions, reconnai ssance, surveillance, and target acquisition squadron, \nand fires battalion to conduct field maintenance. The combat repair teams are controlled by the \nmaintenance control officer who coordinates with the supported battalion S-4 and XO to establish work priorities, control movements, and integrate combat repair team operations into the supported battalion \nOPLANs. Shop stock is permitted for each combat repair team but the combat repair team may not stock \nmore than they can carry in its organic vehicles. In the SBCT, the combat repair teams will carry a minimal class IX load. Due to its limited size, the combat repa ir team will often require a daily resupply of mission \ncritical repair parts. Maintenance teams are dispatched  as far forward as possible in order to reduce the \nrequirement to ev acuate equipment. \n \nThis page intentionally left blank .  \n \n \n2 April 2014 ATP 4-90 Glossary-1 Glossary  \nSECTION I – ACRONYMS AND ABBREVIATIONS \nABCT armored brigade combat team \nADP Army doctrine publication \nADRP Army doctrine reference publication \nAHS Army Health System \nAO area of operations \nAR Army regulation \nASB aviation support battalion \nASL authorized stockage list \nATHP ammunition transfer and holding point \nATP Army techniques publication \nATTP Army tactics, techniques publication \nBCS3 Battle Command Sustainment Support System \nBCT brigade combat team \nBDAR battle damage assessment and repair \nBFSB battlefield surveillance brigade \nBMSO brigade medical supply office \nBSA brigade support area \nBSB brigade support battalion \nBSMC brigade support medical company \nCAB combat aviation brigade \nCBRN chemical, biological, radi ological, and nuclear \nCCIR commander’s critical information requirement \nCOP common operational picture \nCP command post \nCSSB combat sustainment support battalion \nDA Department of the Army \nFBCB2 Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below \nFLE forward logistics element \nFM field manual \nFMT field maintenance team \nFSC forward support company \nGCSS-Army (F/T) Global Combat Support Syst em – Army (field/tactical) \nHHC headquarters and headquarters company \nHQ headquarters \nIBCT infantry brigade combat team \nLIS logistic information system \nLOGCAP logistics civilian augmentation program \nLOGPAC logistics package \nGlossary  \nGlossary-2 ATP 4-90 2 April 2014 MCO maintenance control officer \nMCP maintenance collection point \nMCS maintenance control section \nMDMP military decisionmaking process \nMEB maneuver enhancement brigade \nMETT-TC mission, enemy, terrain an d weather, troops and support available, time \navailable, civil considerations (mission variables)  \nMSR main supply route \nMTF medical treatment facility \nNCO noncommissioned officer \nOPCON operational control \nOPLAN operation plan \nOPLOG operational logistics \nOPORD operation order \nS-1 battalion or brigade manpower and personnel staff officer \nS-2 battalion or brigade intelligence staff officer \nS-3 battalion or brigade operations staff officer \nS-4 battalion or brigade logistics staff officer \nS-6 battalion or brigade signal staff officer \nSBCT Stryker brigade combat team \nSOP standard operating procedures \nSPO support operations officer \nSSA supply support activity \nUMT unit ministry team \nU.S. United States \nXO executive officer \nSECTION II – TERMS \n*area support \n(Army) Method of logistics, medical support, and personnel services in which support relationships are \ndetermined by the location of the units requiring s upport.

for logistics operations of the brigade support battalion. it describe s the functions of the brigade support battalion (bsb), which includes a headquarters comp any, a distribution company, a fiel d maintenance company, a brigade support medical company and forward su pport companies. the bsb is capable of task organizing to support the brigade combat team conducting decisive action operations. the principal audience for atp 4-90 is commanders and staffs assigned to a brigade support battalion and brigade combat team commanders and staffs. it is also applicable to other operational and sustainment organizations in an operational environment. trainers and educators throughout the army will also use this publication. commanders, staffs and subordinates ensure that their decisions and actions comply with applicable united states, international, and, in some cases, host nation laws and regulations. commanders at all levels ensure that their soldiers operate in accordance w ith the law of war and the rules of engagement. (see field manual [fm] 27-10). atp 4-90 uses joint terms where applicable. selected jo int and army terms and definitions appear in both the glossary and the text. for definitions shown in the text, the term is italicized and the number of the proponent publication follows the definition. this publication is not the proponent for any army terms. atp 4-90 applies to the active army, army national guard/army national guard of the united states, and the united states army reserve unless otherwise noted. un less this atp states otherwise, masculine nouns and pronouns do not refer exclusively to men. the proponent of atp 4-90 is the united states army su stainment center of excellence. the preparing agency is the combined arms support command, training support and doctrine. send comments and

brigade support battalion (bsb) role, organization and operations in support of a brigade combat team (bct) or support brigade. atp 4-90 is a revision of fm 4-90, brigade support battalion , last published in 2010 this atp was written for commanders, staffs and sold iers assigned to a brigade support battalion, the brigade combat team and the support brigades. it pr ovides relevant information to echelon above brigade sustainment organizations. atp 4-90 provides information on the role and functions of each organization within the bsb. atp 4-90 clarifies existing bsb doctrine. the intent is to frame the bsb in the context of its role within its supported brigade as opposed to its role within the sustainment system. this is accomplished by eliminating discussion about modular logistics and focusing on bsb operations. the updates to atp 4-90 account for mission command philosophy , emerging army vision and impl ementation of global combat support system-army field/tactical (gcss-army (f/t). language and content of the manual are consistent with current doctrine guidelines. this is primarily accomplished by removing functional details from the chapters describing the subordinate companies and referring the reader to the appropriate functional atp. organization graphics are updated with known organizational changes and gcss-army (f/t) operations are annotated where appropriate. the aviation support battalion’s role, organization and operations are consolidated into a single chapter. all text related to mission command warfighting functions and log reporting is consolidated into a single chapter which includes an expanded section on mission command systems and command post (cp) opera tions. there are three appe ndices: an echelon of support appendix, a brigade support area (bsa) ap pendix and a current stryker brigade combat team appendix. atp 4-90 contains eight chapters:  chapter 1 includes the role of the bsb, how the bsb supports the sustainment warfighting function and decisive action tasks. the chapter also includes bsb concept of support and descriptions of echelon above brigade units that would support th e bsb and the bsb supported brigades.  chapter 2 lists the battalions’ capabilities and bsb headqua rters and staff organization. of note are the duties of specific staff elements a nd how they integrate with the suppor ted brigade’s staff. there is also a section on how the bsb fits within its supported br igade. section four includes the battlefield surveillance brigade’s (bfsb) brigade support compan y role, organization and operations.  chapter 3 provides an overview of th e distribution company and includ es recent capability updates.  chapter 4 is about the field maintenance company.  chapter 5 describes the brigade support medical comp any (bsmc) and includes the bsmc’s role, organization graphic and bsmc operations.  chapter 6 provides the role, organization and operations of the aviation support battalion (asb). the asb is both structured differently an d operates differently from the bsb.  chapter 7 is about the forward support company (fsc). the chapter identifies the role of the fsc, the fsc organization and describes what the fsc does. the chapter also includes a discussion of the fsc commander’s role and command relationship between the fsc, the bsb and the supported battalion.  chapter 8 is mission command and logistic reporting. the content includes operations process, command post operations, mission command systems available to accomplish logistic reporting and a section on logistic reporting. this page intentionally left blank . 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 1-1 chapter 1 role of the brigade support battalion (bsb) the brigade combat team (bct) and support brigades provide commanders with ready and relevant warfighting capabilities th at are mission-tailored and scalable. the bsbs provide capabilities that can be task or ganized to support decisive action tasks. this chapter provides an overview of the bsb role and describes how the bsb supports its supported brigades. organizati ons without a bsb will be supported by a sustainment brigade. section i – bsb role 1-1. brigade combat teams are the prim ary combined arms force that ex ecutes decisive actions for the army. brigade combat teams provide the land component or joint task force commander with unique capabilities in support of unified land operations. there are three standard types of bcts—the armored brigade combat teams (abct), the in fantry brigade combat team (ibct), and the stryker brigade combat team (sbct). all six warfighting functions; mission command, movement and maneuver, intelligence, fires, sustainment, and protection, are organic to a brigade combat team. support brigades reinforce the bct with the following capabilities; sustainment, engineer, intelligence, protection, and aviation. 1-2. the bsb’s role is to support the supported brigade’s execution of operations by providing logistic support. the bsb commander must understand the supported commander’s plan and then execute support so the supported brigade maintains freedom of action and maneuver. synchronizing current and future support requirements with the supported brigade are th e hallmarks of successful support. tactical logistics and army health system (ahs) support must be inte grated into the brigade’s concept of operations. 1-3. the bsb commander mission commands all organic bsb capabilities in support of bct priorities. the forward support compan ies (fscs) extend the operational reach of the bsb into the maneuver area and are critical to the success of the logi stic concept of support. bsbs pe rform similar roles in support of brigades however; the capabilities of a bsb vary by design. area support is the method of logistics, medical support, and personnel services in wh ich support relationships are determined by the location of the units requiring support. sustainmen t units provide support to units located in or passing through their assigned areas. the bsb provides area support on an exception basis when they have the capability and capacity to do so. section ii – support to decisive action 1-4. the bsb supports offensive, defensive, stability and defense support of civil authorities (dsca) tasks. bsb operations are accomplished by planning and executing missions within the context of the sustainment warfighting function and by applying the principles of sustainment when executing the support of decisive action tasks. the sustainment warfighting function is the related tasks and systems that provide support and services to ensure freedom of action, extend operational reach, and prolong endurance (army doctrine reference publication [adrp] 3-0). successfully integrating th e sustainment warfighting function into the concept of operations enables freedom of action, extended operational reach and prolonged endurance. 1-5. operational reach is the distance and duration across which a unit can successfully employ military capabilities. the bsb enables operationa l reach by task organizing fs cs with required capabilities to prolong the endurance of brigade operations while ma intaining sufficient support to ensure freedom of action. endurance stems from the ability to maintain, protect, and sustain forces, regardless of how far chapter 1 1-2 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 away they are deployed, how austere the environment, or how long decisive tasks are continued. the bsb enables endurance ensuring a continuous flow of sustainment to its supported brigade. 1-6. the objective of sustainment in offensive tasks is to provide sufficient support to enable the bct to conduct the four primary offensive tasks: movement to contact, attack, exploitation and pursuit employing the six forms of maneuver: envelopment, turning move ment, frontal attack penetration, infiltration, and flank attack. sustainment of offens ive tasks involves providing support to widely dispersed forces along extended lines of communication. sustainment support to offensive tasks is focused on rearming, refueling, casualty evacuation and maintenance support. the follo wing tasks are common in support of sustainment planning for offensive operations:  plan and conduct recovery operations.  position sustainment forward to reduce resupply and maintenance support requirements.  plan and conduct airdrop operations.  plan and conduct casualty evacuation operations.  consider establishing aerial resu pply and forward logistics bases. 1-7. the objective of sustainment in defensive tasks is to provide sufficient support to enable the bct to conduct the three primary defe nsive tasks: area defense, mobile defense and retrograde. area defense is a defensive task that concentrates on denying enemy forces access to designated terrain for a specific time rather than destroying the enemy (adrp 3-90). the mobile defense concentrates on destruction or defeat of the enemy through a deci sive attack by a striking force (adrp 3-90). retrograde involves organized movement away from the enemy (adrp 3-90). sustai nment support of defensive tasks is focused on rearming, counter mobility and casualty evacuation. cons ider the following points for defensive operations sustainment planning:  locate bsb and support points where they can best fulfill support tasks while using minimal resources to maintain security.  plan and conduct casualty evacuation operations. 1-8. the sustainment of stability tasks often involves supporting u.s. and multinational forces in a wide range of missions. it can be conducted in support of a host nation or interim government or as part of an occupation when no governments exist. stability tasks range from long-term humanitarian and civic assistance missions to major short notice peace enfo rcement. some stability ta sks may involve combat. tailoring supplies, personnel and equipment to the specific needs of the operation is essential. 1-9. sustainment for stability tasks is unique and more complex due to physically dispersed unit locations, lack of adequate infrastructure, nontrad itional demands by civil military operations, and the burden caused by displaced civilians. leaders mu st understand all the mission variables and remain flexible. stability operations are generally fluid envi ronments for support soldiers and can result in confusion if leaders are not operationally aware of support agreements. 1-10. host-nation support, operational contract support, and local purchases are force multipliers during the execution of many decisive action tasks. situations that lack optimal sustaining capabilities may require using nonstandard logistics. they may augment or replace existing logistics capability. nonstandard logistics can reduce dependence on the logistic system, improve response time and free airlift and sealift for other priority needs. contingency contracting personnel should precede the main body of army forces, if feasible. nonstandard logistics may be employed for:  limited supplies such as classes i, ii, iii, iv, vii, and ix.  services such as catering, maintenanc e and repair, sanitation, and laundry.  transportation. 1-11. defense support of civil authorities (dsca) is genera lly used in cases of domestic emergencies, for designated law enforcement support, and other activities upon request for assistance from civil authorities. civil support includes operations that address the consequences of natural or man-made disasters, accidents, terrorist attacks, and inci dents in the united states and its te rritories. army forces conduct civil support operations when civil authorities request assistance and the secretary of defense concurs. in defense support of civil authorities, military forces al ways play a supporting role . state and federal laws define how military forces can support civil authoritie s. often, a state's national guard forces, acting in role of the brigade support battalion (bsb) 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 1-3 their state capacities under title 32 of the unites states code, are enough to provide an adequate response to a situation. however, when these forces are not enough, governors may request additional support from federal authorities. for more information see department of defense directive 3025.18 and army doctrine publication (adp) 3-28, defense support of civil authorities. concept of support 1-12. the bsb plans, coordinates, synchronizes, and executes replenishment operations in support of brigade operations. it distributes supply classes i, ii, iii, iv, v, vii, viii and ix; provides food service; and roles 1 and 2 ahs support, as well as field mainte nance and recovery. it maintains visibility of the distribution network within their area of operations, sy nchronizing the flow of throughput into the brigade’s operational area. sustainment leaders use operational variables, political, military, economic, social, information, infrastructure, physical environment, and time and mission variables, mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support availa ble, time available and civil cons iderations (mett–tc), to assess situations and make decisions. 1-13. although bsb capabilities and structure differ somewhat depending upon the type of bct, all are designed to provide direct support to its supported br igade. bsbs provide responsive support to the brigade by positioning fscs with maneuver, cavalry, fires and engineer battalions. the type of support may vary by battalion based upon the situation and support requirements. 1-14. bsbs provide distribution platforms that enable the brigades to c onduct sustained operations for a finite period of time. bsbs plan and execute replenishment operations in support of maneuver force battles and engagements. replenishment operations are delib erate, time-sensitive operations conducted to replenish forward support companies with essential supplies, such as class iii(b) and class v. the sustainment brigade can provide logistics capability that is not organic to the bsb, such as water purification and bulk fuel, or provide additional capacity , such as additional transportation, to support the bsb. 1-15. army logistics enables the commander to execute his mission and sustain the force, throughout the range of army operations. logistics forces are flexible and may be employed in nonstandard tasks. like all other elements, they must be capable of self-defense, particularly if they deploy alone or in advance of other army forces. 1-16. the support concept for the bct is based on a number of facts and assumptions used in the military decision making process (mdmp). the bsb support operations officer (spo) coordinates with the support operations staff of the sustainment brigade and/or the combat sustainment support battalions (cssb) designated for support. coordination may include ammunition support, designated field services, bulk fuel support, water purification, general supply support, tran sportation, and mortuary affairs support. in addition to the daily logistics support operations that the bs b performs, the bsb may be on-call to provide a range of logistical sustainment in support of personn el recovery operations or detainee operations. 1-17. command relationships of supporting organizations must be clearly defined during the planning process. when the bct receives capa bility attached from the support brigades , such as the fires brigade, the bsb spo must understand the task organization and the command relationship. the spo coordinates with supporting organizations on what organic support they are bringing with them. the spo will array those capabilities on the battlefield so that they are integrated with the bsb capabilities. logistics planners require some basic information from the parent unit’ s battalion logistics staff officer (s-4) to develop a synchronized concept of support. some considerations are:  number and type of personnel and equipment.  supply consumption history.  when attachment is effective and for how long.  the support assets that will accompany the attached element.  when and where replenishment operations will occu r, and which individual or unit has primary responsibility for planning and coordinating this action. 1-18. units deploy with a pre-determined amount of supplies on hand. sustainment stocks continue to flow during the initial, early entry buildup. support re quirements change rapidly as does the operational chapter 1 1-4 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 environment. the bsb focus is on distribution operations, getting the right stuff to the right place at the right time in support of the bct operations. 1-19. there are often host nation and theater support cont racts in place for transpor tation, life support, and facilities support as necessary. when the situati on warrants, logistics civil augmentation program (logcap) may be used to meet internal support requirements. logcap is coordinated through the sustainment brigade and the army fi eld support brigade. in either co ntract support option, the bsb may be called upon to provide contracting officer representatives for contracted logistic services being executed in the supported bct’s area of operation. operational energy 1-20. brigade support battalions will cons ider operational energy in the planning and executing of their missions. operational energy is the sum of energy and associated systems, information and processes required to train, move, and sustain forces and systems for military operations. the bsb must consider ways to conserve or reduce the amount of operatio nal energy resources used in military operations. through conservation of energy resources, commanders can reduce resupply operations, increase vehicle and equipment efficiency, and reduce environmental damage. a continuous process, commanders must plan and oversee operations to reduce consumption, use alternative energy means, a nd incorporate the latest energy saving technologies. employing a combination of best practices, technologies, and discipline in managing and executing supply and field services operations will extend op erational reach and reduce mission risk. support methods 1-21. logistics operations can be tailored in response to changes in tactical requirements. bsb support operations are fully integrated with the brigade battle rhythm through planning and oversight of on-going operations. logistical synchronization matrices and logistics reports are used to initiate and maintain synchronization between operations and logistics functions. 1-22. supported unit commanders coordinate through their battalion operations staff officer (s-3) and s-4 staffs to decide the time and place fo r replenishment operations at a temporarily established point. assets can be re-tasked if the situation demands. this centralized approach optimizes the employment of personnel. designated distribution managers such as unit supply sergeants or first sergeants, coordinate and synchronize logistics flow per the commander’s prior ities using all logistics information systems available in order to maximize support to units. unit (battalion/company/platoon) distribution 1-23. in unit distribution, supplies are configured in unit sets (battalion/company/platoon, depending on the level of distribution) and delivered to one or more central locations. this technique makes maximum use of the capacity of bct truck assets by minimizing delivery and turnaround time. supply point distribution 1-24. supply point distribution requires unit representatives to move to a supply point to pick up their supplies. supply point distribution is most commonly executed by means of a logistics release point. the logistics release point may be any place on the ground where unit vehicles return to pick up supplies and then take them forward to their unit. occasionally, the logistics release point is the brigade support area (bsa). a bsa is a designated area in which sustain ment elements locate to provide support to a brigade . refuel on the move 1-25. the doctrinal purpose of refuel on the move is to extend the time that grou nd maneuver forces can spend on the objective. refuel on the move is most often used to support extended moves to or from a tactical assembly area before an attack or before a retrograde move. supported unit s-3 and s-4 staffs coordinate with the bct s-4 and bsb spo to fix th e time and place to conduct the refuel on the move role of the brigade support battalion (bsb) 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 1-5 operations according to unit battle rhythm. when vehicles enter a refuel on the move site for refueling, they receive a predetermined amount of fuel (usually timed) and they move out to re turn to their convoy or formation. fm 10-67-1, concepts and equipment of petroleum operations, contains more information about refuel on the move operations. aerial resupply (fixed-wing and rotary wing) 1-26. aerial delivery distribution provides an effective means of conducting distribution operations. in order for aerial delivery to be ef fective, friendly forces must cont rol airspace throughout the area of operations (ao) and enemy ground-based air defenses must be neutralized. it is used for routine and urgent resupply to units in various locations where terrain limits access. aerial delivery acts as a combat multiplier because it is an effective means of by-passing enemy activities and reduces the n eed for route clearance of ground lines of communications. aerial delivery includes airdrop, airland, and sling-load operations. it is a vital link in supporting remo te or forward locations. immediate resupply 1-27. immediate resupply, also referred to as emergency resupply, is the least preferred method of distribution of supplies. while some may be required when combat losses occur, requests for immediate resupply not related to combat loss indicates a brea kdown in coordination and collaboration between the logistician and customer. if imme diate resupply is necessary, all pos sible means, including options not covered above, may be used. the battalion/squadron s-4s, the bct s-4, and the bsb spo must constantly and thoroughly collaborate to minimize this need. emergency resupply that extends beyond bsb capabilities requires immediate intervention of the next higher command capable of executing the mission. in such case, the bct s-4 and bsb spo immediately coordinate with the next higher echelon of support for the bct. contract support 1-28. there are three types of contract ed support available to support an operational commander: theater support, systems support, and exte rnal support. theater support cont racts are contracts awarded by contingency contracting officers deployed to the opera tional area that provide the ability to rapidly contract for logistics support within a theater of operations. systems support contracts are prearranged contracts awarded and funded by acquisition program executive officers and project/product management officers. these contracts provide technical supp ort, maintenance support and, in some cases, class ix support for a variety of non-type classified and selected army weapon and support systems. 1-29. external support contracts are contracts awarded by contracting organizations whose contracting authority does not derive directly from the theater su pport contracting head(s) of contracting activity or from systems support contracting authorities. external support service contracts provide a variety of logistic and other non-combat related services and supply support. the largest and most commonly known external support contract is the army’s logcap. logcap may provide supply services (e.g. storage, warehousing, or distribution) for the nine classe s of supplies, but the se rvices source the actual commodities. see army tactics, t echniques publication (attp) 4-10, operational contract support tactics, techniques, and procedures, and army regulation (ar) 700-137, logistics civil augmentation program , for additional information. 1-30. commanders can expect that contractors will be involved in operations. the management and control of contractors differs from the mission command of sold iers and department of the army civilians. during military operations, soldiers and army civilians are under the control of the military chain of command. commanders can direct soldier and army civilian task assignment, special recognition, and disciplinary action. however, they do not have the same contro l over contractors. the terms and conditions of the contract establish relationships between the military and the contractor. commanders and staff planners must assess the need for prov iding operational area security to a cont ractor and designate forces to provide security when appropriate. the missi on of, threat to, and location of the contractor determines the degree of protection needed. chapter 1 1-6 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 1-31. interface for operational contract support will be done by the supporting sustainment brigade. exceptions would be designated field ordering officers who draw their purchasing authority from the supporting contingency contracting element servicing the brigade area. 1-32. when coordinated, the defense logistics agency throughputs bulk fuel, water, and food to units assigned to a brigade. this may be done either through pre-positioned stocks or defense logistics agency theater support contracts (e.g., into-p lane contracts, into-bag contracts, into-truck contracts) after sources are inspected and approved by veterinary and preventive medicine personnel. echelon above brigade support organizations 1-33. all sustainment requirements (less medical) beyond the bsb’s ability are coordinated through the supporting sustainment brigade. the sustainment brigade supports the bct on an area basis either in a general support or direct support role, which is determined by the theater concept of support plan. the sustainment brigade provides support to bcts and support brigades for capability not organic to the bsb. these capabilities include transportation support, fuel storage, water production, field service support and contingency contracting. sustainment brigade 1-34. the sustainment brigade is task-organized based on mission. all sustainmen t brigade headquarters (hq) are identical in organizational structure and capabilities. the building blocks of the sustainment brigade are cssbs and/or functional logistics battali ons. sustainment brigades are subordinate to the theater sustainment command/expeditionary sustainment command and are task organized to provide support in an assigned area of operations. some of the logistics units which may be assigned to the sustainment brigade are discusse d below. refer to atp 4-93, sustainment brigade , for more details on the sustainment brigade. combat sustainment support battalions (cssb) 1-35. the combat sustainment support battalion is task or ganized to provide logistics support to brigade combat teams and support brigades. atp 4-93, sustainment brigade , has more information about the cssbs. the combat sustainment support battalion provides the following capabilities in support of the brigade combat teams and support brigades:  ammunition lift platoons or modular ammunition companies assigned to the cssb operate an ammunition supply area or point which prov ides for the receipt, storage, issue, and reconfiguration of ammunition items.  transportation elements provide mobility of personnel and distribution of all classes of supplies. at the tactical level, the combat sustainment support battalion’s transportation assets provide distribution capacity from the cssb support area to the brigade support battalion.  a multi-capable supply company provides water purification and bulk fuel storage, capabilities no longer available within the bsb.  cssb support maintenance companies may be requested to provide support for certain lowdensity commodities such as communications, electronics, and armament.  supply and services assets of the cssb provide all classes of supplies and field service operations for personnel assigned to or transiting through the ao. field services include clothing exchange, laundry and shower support, rigger units, and mortuary affairs support. bsb coordination for echelon above brigade support 1-36. when the supported brigade’s support requirements exceed bsb capability, immediate coordination between the bsb commander and staff, bct commander and staff, and the supporting sustainment brigade must occur. the bsb may require additional capability because th ey lack organic f unctions of water purification, non-mobile bulk petroleum storage, fiel d services or increased distribution capability. the additional capability could be required due to an incr ease in population, scope of mission, or equipment density as a result of extensive bct task organization. role of the brigade support battalion (bsb) 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 1-7 1-37. the bsb commander, spo, s-3, and subordinate companies must constantly monitor the support requirements of the supported brigade and immediat ely notify the bsb commander if a capability shortfall exists. conversely, the bct commander, bct staff, and the supported battalion commanders must constantly assess their support requirements and communicate shortfa lls to the bsb. 1-38. once a capability shortfall is identified, the bsb commander and staff must analyze it and determine if the shortfall can be corrected internally before re questing echelon above brigad e support. the outcome of the analysis and a recommended course of action is coordinated with the bct commander, bct staff, and battalion commanders to ensure complete understanding of the course of action and consensus. the bsb commander also recommends the type of command or support relationship the echelon above brigade element has with the supported brigade. although echelon above brigade support units have a general support relationship to the bct and support brig ades, a direct support relationship or a command relationship such as operational control (opcon) or tactical control may be appropriate. 1-39. the bsb spo normally coordinates directly w ith the supporting sustainment brigade spo. coordination for additional capability may also be conducted through command channels. the bsb spo identifies the requirements: type, scope, and projected duration of support required and the sustainment brigade determines how they will provide support. 1-40. the supporting sustainment brigade tasks a cssb to provide the support. the supporting cssb spo coordinates with the bsb spo to integrate the echelon above brigade capability into the concept of support and to synchronize support operations. the bsb spo will array additional capabilities on the battlefield so that they are integrated with the bsb capabilities. the bsb must ensure all supporting and supported units have a complete understanding of the additional capab ility, support requirements, and the established support or command relationship. 1-41. as the mission changes, support requirements, support/command relationships and the supported units priority of support also changes. supported and supporting units must continually assess support requirements and balance them against priority of support and available capability to ensure the most effective use of sustainment resources. movement control team (mct) 1-42. the movement control team is a modular transportation organization which commits allocated transportation assets, regulates movement on theater controlled main supply routes (msr) and alternate supply routes, and provides transportation services in a theater of operation. movement control teams are subordinate elements of the movement control battalio n and are positioned throughout the theater to assist in the decentralized execution of movement control responsibilities. movement control teams are the entry point for joint and army forces to request army common user transportation assets when movement requirements exceed an organization’s or ganic transportation capability. atp 4-16, movement control , describes roles, responsibilities, and command relationships for organizations planning, executing, and supporting army movement control. brigade logistics support team 1-43. the brigade logistics support team is a deployable organization made up of both military and department of the army civilians that normally operates in direct support of a bct or combat aviation brigade (cab) or brigade level unit, and provides limited general support to other units on an area basis as directed. the brigade logistics suppo rt team is the primary interface w ith between the bct and/or the cab and the u. s. army materiel command regarding sustainment maintenance and related acquisition, logistics and technology support. the brigade logistic s support team’s team chief acts as u. s. army materiel command’s advisor to the supported brigade commander and is responsible to coordinate all u. s. army materiel command and related acquisition, logistics and technology support with the supported unit command and staff. the brigade logistics support team’s chief coordinates day-to-day activities through the bsb spo. 1-44. brigade logistics support teams normally deploy with their supported brigade. when deployed, brigade logistics support teams are us ually attached to an army field su pport battalion and receive logistics, facility and security support from th eir supported brigade. in this role , the brigade logistics support team chapter 1 1-8 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 consists of various life cycle command logistic assist ance representatives who advise the supported brigade and bsb commanders regarding u. s. army materiel command sustainment maintenance capabilities. the brigade logistics support team also provides mainte nance advice and assistance to the field maintenance company mechanics as coordinated th rough the bsb spo and facilitates reach back to u. s. army materiel command through its parent army field support battalion and army field support brigade. refer to atp 491, army field support brigade , for more information. echelons above brigade support for medical and class viii 1-45. army health system support beyond the bct brigade support medical company (bsmc) capabilities are provided by echelon above brigade medical units. other supporting units 1-46. other organizations that routinely support bsb logistics operations are aviation units, engineers and military police. aviation assets could be used for cargo distribution as part of the distribution plan and for convoy security. engineers assist distribution tasks th rough route clearance and site construction. military police can provide additional security when necessary and are the force responsible for detainee operations. area support responsibilities 1-47. the bsb is organic to the bct and was designed with enough capacity to support the bct. if the bct deploys with a division, echelon above brigade units operating in the bct ao obtain support from the sustainment brigade or logistics task force employ ed in the division’s ao. ar my special forces units are an example of a unit that may opera te or transit through the area but not in direct support of the brigade. special forces units have some organic support cap abilities but are reliant upon regional or combatant command theater of operations infrastructure. atp 3-05.40, special operations sustainment , provides more details on special operations sustainment. 1-48. when the bct task force is directly supported by a corps or theater asset, the spo coordinates with supporting organizations on what support they ar e bringing with them. the spo will array those capabilities on the battlefield so that they are integr ated with the bsb capabilities. in all cases, echelon above brigade units receive ahs sup port in an emergency from the near est ahs support medical treatment facility with the capability to treat the category of emergency of the casualty/patient regardless of unit affiliation. section iii – supported organizations 1-49. the bsb is designed to support brigade combat teams, and support brigades. each bct and support brigade has a bsb designed to sustain the supported brigade. this section describes each supported brigade, and organization design. brigade combat teams (bct) 1-50. infantry, armored and stryker brigade combat te ams comprise the army’s combat power building blocks. brigade combat teams often operate as part of a division. the division acts as a tactical headquarters that can control up to five bcts in high- or mid-intensity combat operations, plus a number of supporting functional brigades. the division assigns the brigade combat team its mission, ao, and supporting elements, and coordinates its actions with other brigade combat teams of the formation. the brigade combat team may be required to detach subordinate elements to other bcts of the division. in its principal role as a combined arms maneuver unit, the bct closes with and destroys the enemy by combining reconnaissance, surveillance, target acquis ition, long range fires, maneuver, and the support of joint forces and other army units. it uses every available military and interagency means to gain information superiority, and to ensure understanding of every aspect of the terrain , weather, enemy, civil concerns, and friendly forces prior to and during execution. role of the brigade support battalion (bsb) 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 1-9 infantry brigade combat team (ibct) 1-51. the ibct conducts offensive, defensive, and stability operations. the ibct’s core role is to close with the enemy by means of fire and maneuver to destroy or capture enem y forces, or to repel their attacks by fire, close combat, and counterattack. the ibct co nsists of three infantry battalions; reconnaissance, surveillance, target acquisition; fires battalion; the br igade engineer battalion and brigade support battalion. 1-52. the ibct provides specialized capabilities as an independent maneuver force or as a subordinate maneuver component to division or corps in major comb at operations. in a smaller-scale contingency, the ibct provides a corps or joint ta sk force a combat team that depl oys rapidly, executes forced entry operations, and conducts offensive operations immediately upon arrival to prevent, contain, stabilize or resolve a conflict, or to promote peace. for more information on the ibct and its operations and subordinate unit capabilities. figure 1-1 shows the units that make up the ibct. figure 1-1. infantry brigade combat team 1-53. the ibct bsb contains a headquarters and headqu arters company, a distribution company, a field maintenance company, a medical co mpany and six fscs: identical fsc s support each infantry battalion one fsc supports an armored reconnaissance squadron, one fsc supports the fires battalion and one fsc supports the brigade engineer battalion. armored brigade combat team (abct) 1-54. abcts are designed to conduct offensive, defensive, and stability operations. their core role is to close with the enemy by means of fire and maneuver to destroy or capture enemy forces, or to repel their attacks by fire, close combat, and counterattack. the abct provides significant capabilities as a subordinate maneuver component to division or corps commanders. the abct includes three combined arms battalions, a reconnaissance squadron, a fires ba ttalion, a brigade engin eer battalion and brigade support battalion. for more information on the abct and its operations and subordinate unit capabilities. figure 1-2 on -10 shows how the abct is organized. chapter 1 1-10 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 figure 1-2. armored brigade combat team 1-55. the abct bsb contains a headquarters and headqu arters company, a distri bution company, a field maintenance company, a medical company and six fo rward support companies: identical fscs support each combined arms battalion, one forward supp ort company supports an armored reconnaissance squadron, one forward support company supports the fires battalion and one forward support company supports the brigade engineer battalion. stryker brigade combat team (sbct) 1-56. the sbct is an early entry force, designed fo r rapid deployment and to conduct small scale contingencies. the stryker brigade combat team is ideally suited for early entr y operations where support infrastructure is limited or absent but where a relativ ely powerful, lethal, and flexible combat force is required. the sbct consists of three stryker infantry battalions; a reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition squadron; a field artillery battalion; a brigad e engineer battalion, a brigade support battalion; an antitank company; a network support company; a military intelligence company; and a brigade headquarters and headquarters comp any (hhc). the stryker brigade comb at team is designed to allow increased capabilities through scalability. for more information on the sbct and its operations and subordinate unit capabilities . figure 1-3 shows how the stryker brigade combat team is organized. figure 1-3. stryker brigade combat team 1-57. the stryker bsb contains a headquarters and headqu arters company, a distri bution company, a field maintenance company, a medical company and six fo rward support companies: identical fscs support each stryker battalion, one forward su pport company supp orts a reconnaissance, su rveillance, and target acquisition squadron, one forward support company supports the fires battalion and one forward support company supports the brigade engineer battalion. role of the brigade support battalion (bsb) 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 1-11 support brigades 1-58. a mix of multifunctional support brigades suppor t theater army, corps, and division commanders. these supporting brigades includ e the fires brigade, maneuver enhancement brigade (meb), combat aviation brigade (cab), battlefield surveillance brigade (bfsb), and sustainment brigade. these brigades are task organized to support bcts and carry out sp ecific tasks in support of echelons above bct. a division involved in major combat operations should be supported by all five types of support brigades. 1-59. most support brigades are not fixed organizations. all support brigades excep t the cab are designed around a base of organic elements, to which a mix of additional capabilities is added based on the factors of mett-tc. the brigade headquarters includes the necessary expertise to control many different capabilities. each type of support brigade’s base includes organic signal and sustainment capabilities. fires brigade 1-60. a fires brigade’s primary task is to conduct strike operations. the fires brigade is the only army field artillery organization above the brigade combat team and can be directed to execute tasks for any joint, service, or functional hq. the fires brigade is neither organic to any army organization or echelon, nor is it focused on any specific region or geographic combatant commander’s area of responsibility. the fires brigade is normally attach ed to a division hq. organic fires brig ade assets include a rocket/missile battalion equipped with either the m270a1 track multiple launch rocket system or the m142 wheel highmobility artillery rocket system. the fires brigade al so includes a bsb, headquarters and headquarters battery, a signal network support company, and a target acquisition battery. refer to atp 3-09.24, techniques for the fires brigade , for more information about the fires br igade. figure 1-4 is an example of a type of fires brigade. figure 1-4. fires brigade 1-61. a bsb in a fires brigade provides support to the brigade by providing and/or coordinating classes i, ii, iii, iv, v, vii, and ix supplies, role 1 ahs support, limited field maintenance and limited transportation support. the bsb operates an ammunitio n transfer holding point (athp) in the bsa, and plans and coordinates for mortuary affairs support. th e fires brigade bsb contai ns an hhc, a distribution company, and a field maintenance co mpany. it does not contain a medical company. one fsc is organic to the fires brigade and the other fires fsc are attached. all fires fsc are designed to support the particular type of field artillery battalion of which the brigade is comprised (i.e., paladin, multiple launch rocket system, towed). chapter 1 1-12 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 maneuver enhancement brigade (meb) 1-62. the meb provides task organized forces in support of army division, echelon above division, joint, interagency, or multinational headquarters. the mane uver enhancement brigade operates across all unified land operations to support, reinforce or complement offensive and defensive major combat operations and can support or conduct stability or defense support to civil authorities operations. the meb is designed as a headquarters capable of conducting mission command warfighting function tasks with a multifunctional brigade staff that is optimized to conduct maneuver support operations. the maneuver enhancement brigade is not a maneuver brigade alth ough it can be assigned an ao and control terrain. the meb receives and mission commands forces to conduct operations. maneuver enhancement brigades provide capabilities to enhance freedom of movement and maneuver for operational and tactical commanders. refer to fm 390.31, maneuver enhancement brigade operations . 1-63. beyond its three organic units; h eadquarters and headquarters comp any, network support company, and brigade support battalion, the meb has no fixed structure. the meb will require tailoring or task organization for every mission that it performs. the or ganization is tailored to respond to the factors of mett-tc. an meb typically includes a mix of severa l types of battalions and separate companies which may include civil affairs; chemi cal, biological, radiologi cal, and nuclear (cbrn); engineer; explosive ordnance disposal; and military police units. it may also contain military intelligence assets, tactical combat force, and air and missile defense units. figure 1-5 is a possible meb task organization. figure 1-5. maneuver enhancement brigade 1-64. the meb bsb provides support to the meb by providing and/or coordinating classes i, ii, iii, iv, v, vii, and ix supplies, field maintenance, and lim ited transportation support. it also coordinates for additional transportation needs identified by the br igade. the bsb of the meb contains an hhc, a distribution company and a field main tenance company. it does not co ntain fscs or a medical company. however, it does have organic role 1 ahs support with the brigade surgeon section and the medical treatment team. 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 2-1 chapter 2 bsb capabilities and organization the bsb, in all of its various designs, is capable of supporting decisive action tasks. chapter two describes the mission and function of the command group and coordinating staff. this chapter also hi ghlights the different

this section describes the types of bsbs supportin g the brigade. the bsb consists of specifically force designed units capable of supporting their particular bct or support brigade. brigade combat team bsb 2-45. the abct, ibct and sbct have a headquarters and headquarters company, a distribution company, a field maintenance company, and a brigad e support medical company which provides role 2 ahs support to the bsb an d the supported brig ade. they each have six forw ard support companies that provide multifunctional logistics support to a maneuver battalion; one per armored reconnaissance battalion, one for each of three combined arms battalions, one for the fires battalion and one for the brigade engineer battalion. figure 2-2 on -8 depicts a bsb typical of a brigade combat team. 2-46. the bsb has from three to ten subordinate companies depending on the type of bsb. all bsbs have a headquarters and headquarters company, a distribution company which provides supplies to supported battalions and/or forward support companies and a field maintenance compan y which provides field maintenance support to the bsb and to the supported brigade. 2-47. the distribution, field maintenance, and medical company commanders are lik ely to operate in the vicinity of the bsb command post (cp) to facilitate c oordination. however, they do not tie themselves to one spot. they command their companies from the loca tions where they can best assess and influence the support operation. chapter 2 2-8 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 figure 2-2. brigade support battalion within a bct fires bsb, maneuver en hancement brigade bsb 2-48. the fires brigade bsb contains an hhc, a distri bution company, and a fiel d maintenance company. the fires brigade fscs are not organic to the bsb and are designed to support the particular type of field artillery battalion of which the brigade is comprised. the fires brigade bsb does not contain a medical company but depends upon its role 1 unit ahs support and medical company area support. figure 2-3 depicts a bsb within a fires brigade/maneuver enhancement brigade. figure 2-3. bsb within fires brigade/maneuver enhancement brigade 2-49. the role of the spo is to coordinate support requ irements for the field artillery battalions. since there is no medical company, the spo is not responsible for synchronizing army health service support. nor is the spo synchronizing the fsc’s activities, instead th e spo has a coordinating function. the spo has staff supervision of a multi class supply support activity (ssa) and an athp as well as a small maintenance shop that is responsible for field maintenance on bsb and brigade headquarters equipment. although not bsb capabilities and organization 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 2-9 allocated a brigade logistics support team, the fires brigade can request brigade logistics support team capabilities from the supporting army field support brig ade. the fires brigade has one organic battalion, either a multiple launch rocket system or high-mobility artillery rocket system battalion, every other organization is attached. those attachments are usually opcon or attached to brigade combat teams to support mission requirements. 2-50. the meb bsb contains an hhc, a distribution comp any and a field maintenance company. it does not contain fscs or a medical company. in the meb, there are no organic battalions. every organization is attached. the role of the spo is to coordinate support requirements for the military police and engineer battalions task organized to the meb. those attach ments are usually opcon or attached to brigade combat teams to support mission requirements. the spo has staff supervision of the multiclass supply support activity, the athp and the field maintena nce company. the meb’s field maintenance company provides field maintenance for equipment within the bsb and brigade headquarters. although not allocated a brigade logistics support team, the maneuver enhan cement brigade can request brigade logistics support team capabilities from the supportin g army field support brigade. section iv – battlefield s urveillance brigade support company 2-51. the battlefield surveillance brigade conducts reconnaissance and surveillance to answer the division commander’s information requirements, enabling him to focus joint elements of combat power. the brigade also provides assets to enhance the reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities of other units in the division, including bcts. the information it collects focuses on the enemy, terrain and weather, and civil consideration factors of mett-tc which feeds the development and update of the common operational picture (cop). the battlefield surveillance brigade is organized with a military intelligence battalion and a reconnaissance and surveillance squadron. refer to fm 3-55.1, battlefield surveillance brigade (bfsb ), for more information. this section describes the brigade support company role, organization, and operations. figure 2-4 depicts an example of a possible battlefield surveillance brigade task organization. figure 2-4. a notional battlefield surve illance brigade (bfsb) task organization role 2-52. provide field feeding, field maintenance and supply distribution support to a battlefield surveillance brigade (bfsb). organization 2-53. the bfsb contains a brigade suppo rt company, not a bs b. the brigade suppor t company is organic to the bfsb and depends on the bfsb for administrative support, planning and operations management and sustainment automation support. the brigade support company contains capabilities that are generally commensurate with a bsb, but is si zed as a company based on the bfsbs support requirements. it contains chapter 2 2-10 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 a headquarters platoon, a distribution platoon with field feeding, class iii and water, a robust maintenance platoon and an organic role 1 ahs support capability. 2-54. . the distribution platoon consists of a distribution section, a water section and a multi class supply support activity (ssa). the maintenance platoon co nsists of a maintenance control section, field maintenance section, service and recovery section and field maintenance teams that support military intelligence and reconnaissance and surveillance units . figure 2-5 depicts a bfsb brigade support company. operations 2-55. the bfsb s-4 is responsible for planning and coordinating the additional logistical support and field maintenance. the brigade support company is depend ent upon elements of the sustainment brigade for replenishment operations, bdar, combat spares, additional field maintenance support including communications electronics and comm unications security equipment. 2-56. the bfsb differs from a bct in that it does not have a bsb staffed to provide spo functions. the bfsb s-4 section has the required personnel and logistics management automation systems to perform spo functions. the bfsb s-4 is the lead sustainment planner and is responsible for planning and coordinating the additional logistical support and fi eld maintenance. the bfsb s-4 section plans and provides oversight for the brigade’s logistics operations and integrates them with the other sustainment staff plans and estimates. the s- 4 essentially acts as the spo. 2-57. as lead sustainment planning elem ent in the bfsb, the s-4 section integrates sustainment concepts and plans into operational plans and estimates. the s-4 is responsible for the sustainment annex to brigade orders and plans and develops concepts for support. using these documents as a base, the s-4 also coordinates as needed with the supported unit g-4 assi stant chief of staff, logistics or j-4 logistics, directorate of joint staff, and th e sustainment brigade for additional assets to support attachments. figure 2-5. battlefield surveillance brigade support company 2-58. the s-4 communicates requirements and projectio ns both to higher- echelon sustainment organizations (such as the sustainment brigade and medical brigade) and to the supported unit staff. the bfsb s-4 coordinates with the supporting sustainment brigade and the supported g-4/j-4 for replenishment of supplies (except medical) and evacua tion of unserviceable automotive and armament assemblies. the s-4 also coordinates with and maintains staff supervision over the brigade support company to ensure that organic and attached units receive maintenance, supply, transportation, and field bsb capabilities and organization 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 2-11 services support. the s-4 section co ordinates class viii supply with the bfsb surgeon section. movement of class viii materiel into the bfsb and internally within the bfsb is coordinated by the s-4 and the bfsb surgeon section. 2-59. also unique to the brigade support company is the military intelligence forward support platoon. the forward support platoon provides direct support to any military intelligence battalion not organic to the bfsb. refer to fm 3-55.1, battlefield surveillance brigade (bfsb) , sustainment chapter, for details about how the brigade support company supports bfsb units. 2-60. the brigade support company provides limited logistics and field maintenance support to the bfsb. although the bfsb brigade support company is not part of a bsb, its supply distribution, class iii and bulk water, maintenance, and field feeding functions are sim ilar to that of the brigad e fscs. however, the bfsb brigade support company does not have a class v distribution section or organic medical supply, treatment, or evacuation capability. the brigade support company relies on other elements of the brigade for ahs support. this page intentionally left blank . 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 3-1 chapter 3 distribution company the brigade support battalion’s distributio n company is the pr imary supply and transportation hub of the bct. it manages the distribution of supplies to the brigade. it provides distribution capab ility for classes i, ii, iii, iv , v , ix and unclassified maps. this chapter describes the role, organi zation, and operations of the distribution company. role 3-1. the role of the bsb distribution company is to plan, direct, and supervise supply distribution to the brigade. it conducts daily receipt, storage, and issue of supply classes i, ii, iii, iv, v and ix and transports cargo for the brigade. this unit is employed in the brigade support area and operates throughout the supported brigade area. organization 3-2. a bsb distribution company has three platoons: a transportation platoon, a supply platoon and a fuel and water platoon, as shown in figure 3-1. distribution companies perform the same functions within a bsb, however the capabilities of the unit are unique to the brigade to which it is assigned. fuel storage, water purification and additional transportation assets are centralized within cssbs. the bsb spo will coordinate with the sustai nment brigade spo to ensure this support is in place. for additional information about the sustainment brigade and cssb capabilities see atp 4-93, sustainment brigade . figure 3-1. distribution company operations 3-3. the distribution company operates stationary assets such as the ssa and the athp and is also responsible for distributing supplies to the fscs. the intent of the following material is to illustrate what the distribution company does and to provide references for how to do the functional tasks. chapter 3 3-2 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 company headquarters 3-4. the company commander executes mission command for all company operations. the commander executes planned distribution tasks in support of the bsb commander’s concept of support and manages task organization and employment of all distribution assets. 3-5. the first sergeant is the company senior nco and normally is its most experienced soldier. the first sergeant is the commander’s primary logistics and tacti cal advisor. the first sergeant collaborates with the commander and operations officer to plan, coordinate, an d supervise all logistics activities that support the company mission. the first sergeant goes wherever the duties require. 3-6. the company operations officer is the company se cond in command and functions as the company executive officer. the operations officer is the primar y internal logistics planner and coordinator. the operations officer and the company headquarters section operate the company cp. their duties include tactical and logistics coordination with higher, adjacent, and supporte d units. the operations officer may also serve as officer in char ge for the quartering party or company movement officer. transportation support 3-7. the transportation platoon provides transportation support to the brigade and distribution of supplies to the fscs. the transportation pl atoon headquarters provides lead ership, supervision and technical guidance to tactical truck squads performing motor tr ansport operations to brigade units. the transportation platoon executes missions when ordered by the company or bsb. atp 4-11, army motor transport operations , has more detailed information on transportation operations. supply support 3-8. the supply platoon leader provides leadership and technical supervision to the platoon and ensures all operations comply with applicable safety gui delines and bct and bsb sops. the supply platoon operates the multiclass ssa and the athp. the supply pl atoon provides class i, ii, iv, v, vii, and ix support to the bct. the stock cont rol section executes stock control and accounting functions for the ssa. the section manages a facility for supported commoditi es and coordinates with support operations for delivery and pickup of issued assets and turn-ins for maintenance and/or disposal. this includes performing warehouse and inventory management activities. references for automated document processing and warehousing operations include ar 710-2, supply policy below the national level, da pam 710-2-1, using unit supply system , and unit sops. 3-9. the army is implementing a newer web-based enterprise resource planning system called gcssarmy (f/t). gcss-army (f/t) uses sophisticated web based enterprise resource planning technology for receipt, storage operations, issue, and accountability of supplies through out the supply ch ain. there are modules within gcss-army (f/t) that refer to the warehousing and storage functions accomplished in the multi-class ssa. materiel managers use the materiel management module to provide oversight to enforce supply discipline using financial controls to achieve end-to-end logistics. ther e are multiple resources and training guides available for more information on gcss-army (f/t). multiclass supply support activity (ssa) 3-10. the general supply section receives stores and issues, supplies. the supplies may then be part of a logpac going forward to the fscs. they also provid e repair parts to the field maintenance company, maintain the brigades authorized stockage list (asl ), and provide direct exchange for reparable/salvage items. the supply platoon is capable of handling packag ed water for receipt, storage, and issue operations (packaged water is treated the same as dry cargo). 3-11. the supply section designs and establishes the ssa. the supply point layout must be organized and well designed. a well planned layout improves the ability to secure the area and the stored materiel, lends itself to safe operations, and creates an efficient work flow. an ssa sk etch should show the use of the space (receiving, shipping, bulk storage, open yard storage, office sp ace), and the materiel stored (repair parts, construction materials, end items). every deploy ment is different and every supply point is different. distribution company 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 3-3 each ssa storage layout is mett-tc dependant. remember to include the following considerations when planning the ssa layout:  a way to secure the site and establish safe and efficient traffic flow. th is includes entrance and exit control points and parking areas.  storage for all commodities including storage areas for large equipment, such as generators and vehicles, pilferable items, and items requiring controlled climate.  potential to integrate existing structures into ssa design.  thoroughly review the terrain; look for swampy or wet areas, potential flood sites, presence of animal or insect infestations and ability to expand the site. 3-12. the distribution company conducts replenishment operations in two ways; supply point distribution in which the fsc comes to the ss a to receive supplies and unit dist ribution, or logpac, where the distribution company delivers to the fscs. the distribution company receives supplies from the supporting sustainment brigade with the capability to store these supplies and issue them to units within the bsa, and to the fscs. 3-13. retrograde of materiel is the return of new, reparable or salvageable materiel from the owning/using unit back through the distribution system to the source of supply, directed ship-to location and/or point of disposal. retrograde of materiel is as important as the forward distribution of materiel. ammunition transfer and holding point (athp) section 3-14. the athp section supports the brigade with cl ass v and operates the brigade athp. the athp section establishes the athp and receives, temporar ily stores, issues, inspect s, and performs limited munitions maintenance operations support for the bct. the section also provides limited stockage configuration based on operational requirements or suspension notices. the athp transloads munitions to bsb transportation assets and positions battalion ammunition set configurations. the athp holds ammunition for supported units and provides this ammunition to the supported battalions fscs. the supply platoon maintains a mobile storage capability. refer to atp 4-35.1, techniques for munitions handlers, for functional details of how the athp is established and operates. department of the army pamphlet (da pam) 385-64, ammunition and explosives standards , explains army safety criteria and standards for ammunition and explosives. fuel and water support 3-15. the fuel and water platoon leader and platoon sergeant provide leadership and supervision of the fuel and water platoon. the platoon leadership is located wh ere they can best lead th e platoon. they normally are based in the bsa, but operat e throughout the brigade area. 3-16. the fuel section receives, temporarily stores, and issues bulk petroleum to the bct. the section has no static storage capability and has the ability to disp lace whenever necessary. re fer to unit authorization documents for exact type and quantities of assigned equipment. fuel distribution operations are executed by the fuel and water platoon. 3-17. the platoon’s water section stores, and distributes bulk water for the brigade. water operations in the distribution company include forward mobile storage and distribution within the brigade. the bct can expect to obtain bulk water or commercial bottled water in the theater of operations. the type of water obtained is dependent on the type of operation being conducted and the overall status/maturity of the theater. during early portions of an operation, the bct should expect to receive bulk purified water which could transition into bottled water during later periods of the operation. this page intentionally left blank . 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 4-1 chapter 4 field maintenance company the nature of the modern battlefield demands a maintenance system that is flexible, responsive, and focused on returning syst ems to operational status quickly and as near as possible to the point of failure or damage. this requirement implies a forward presence of maintenance into brigade areas. maintenance assets move as far forward as the tactical situation permits to return inoperable and damaged equipment to the battle as quickly as possible. this chapte r describes the role, organization, and operations of the bsb’s field maintenance company. role 4-1. the field maintenance company prov ides field maintenance support to the bsb, the brigade engineer battalion and supported units in the bsa. it also provides limited field maintenance support to the fscs for low density commodities such as communications/electronics and armament equipment. the field maintenance company is employed in the bsa. 4-2. field maintenance is generally characterized by on (near) system maintenance, often using line replaceable unit and component replacement, in the owni ng unit, using tools and te st equipment found in the unit. field maintenance is not limited to remove and replace actions, but also allows for repair of components or end items on (near) system. field maintenance also includes adjustment, alignment, service, applying approved field-level modification work orders as directed, fault/failure diagnoses, battle damage assessment, repair, and recovery. field maintenance is always repair and return to the user, and includes maintenance actions performed by operators. organization 4-3. field maintenance companies are tailored to maintain the specific equipment and densities of the bct they support. therefore, th e organizational structure of both personnel and equipment will vary between bsbs. in general the field maintenance compan y is composed of a comp any headquarters and two platoons: a maintenance control platoon and a maintenance platoon. refer to unit authorization documents for exact type and quantities of assigned equipment. exact configurations of companies vary from command to command depending on mett-tc. for example, some units consolidate the maintenance control section, shop officer, and the service and reco very section in the company headquarters. see figure 4-1 on -2 for an example of a field maintenance company. chapter 4 4-2 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 figure 4-1. field maintenance company (abct) operations 4-4. responsive maintenance support speeds the return of essential combat systems to battle. the thrust of the maintenance effort is to repl ace forward and repair rear. the intent of the following material is to illustrate a way the field maintena nce company accomplishes its missions. details of specific maintenance functions can be found in attp 4-33, maintenance operations . company headquarters 4-5. the company commander mission commands all person nel assigned or attached to the company. one of the company commander’s chief responsibilities is to execute the bsb commanders’ maintenance plan in support of the spo concept of support. the company commander manages task organization and employment of all maintenance and recovery assets . he executes the mission according to the spo’s concept of support and any additional orders. the commander is normally located in the bsa but will always be where he can best command soldiers and execute the mission. the commander provides information and advice concerning maintenance operations throughout the bsa to the bsb commander, support operations staff, the brigade engineer battalion and the brigade headquarters. 4-6. the first sergeant is the company’s senior nco and normally its most experi enced soldier. the first sergeant is the commander’s primary logistics and tacti cal advisor. the first sergeant collaborates with the commander and xo to plan, coordinate, and supervise all logistics activities that support the company mission. the first sergeant is lo cated wherever the duties require. 4-7. the company operations officer is also the compan y xo and is the company’ s second in command. the xo is the primary internal logistics planner and coordinator. the xo and the company headquarters section operate the company cp. his duties include tactical and logistics coordination with higher, adjacent, and supported units. field maintenance operations 4-8. all field maintenance companies perform the same functions within a bsb, however the capabilities of each unit are unique to the brigade to which it is assigned. the majority of the field maintenance company assets are located in the bsa to reduce the burden placed on mane uver elements. the field maintenance company can send limited support forward to support the fsc’s fmts or maintenance collection points (mcp) to ensure support is positioned well forward. the field maintenance company also provides limited recovery and machine shop support to the battalion fscs and brigade engineer battalion. 4-9. the field maintenance company completes diagnostic s and determines if the piece of equipment is field level maintenance or if it is sustainment level maintenance. there are general guidelines available for where and how maintenance is completed, there is no absolute checklist. leaders must decide the best field maintenance company 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 4-3 course of action based on operational and mission variable s. equipment determined to be sustainment level maintenance will be evacuated to a national level pr ovider. upon receipt of replacement class vii items, maintenance personnel, along with the equipment operator, ensure that replacement items are operational and ready for use. when equipment is determined to be sustainment level maintenance, supply sergeants, s-4s and property book personnel must be incorporated into the process in order to maintain accountability. 4-10. sustainment level maintenance is generally character ized by “off system” co mponent repair and/or end item repair and return to the supply system, or by exception, back to the owning unit. it is performed by national-level maintenance providers (including the u.s. army materiel command and installation directorate of logistics maintenanc e activities). the sustainment maintenance function can be employed at any point in the integrated logistics chain. the intent of this level is to perform commodity-oriented repairs on all supported items to return them to a national standard, providing a consistent and measureable level of reliability, and to execute maintenance actions not able to be performed at the field level of maintenance. 4-11. maintenance execution and planning should include the maintenance priorities approved or established by the guiding mission plans and orders. other tasks could include:  identify maintenance collection points that are co llocated at or near mortuary affairs collection points for mutual security purposes that emphasize bdar.  establish criteria for requesting additional recovery assets.  consider the feasibility of dividing up recovery assets to provide broader coverage for attacking companies.  identify critical combat spares and have them ready to move forward on short notice.  ensure rapid repair and return of non mission capable equipment to support the operation.  locate maintenance sites to be accessible to cust omers, including recovery/ bsa and near but off the msr.  ensure maintenance shops, along with parking and equipment holding sites are on firm ground. 4-12. the field maintenance company provides dedicated field maintenance on an area basis to the bsb units as well as limited support to the fscs and supported maneuver battalions. the field maintenance company also retains maintenance ca pabilities in the bsa since certain pieces of test equipment are not easily transportable. the field maintenance compan y provides field maintenance on weapons, power generation and other equipment assigned to the bct headquarters, the brigade engineer battalion, the bsb and, on an area basis, for units operating in the bs a. the field maintenance company provides field maintenance to the brigade’s missile and electronic equipment/weapon systems for those battalions that don’t have the capability in fscs. 4-13. the field maintenance company also provides welding and lift capabilities for the repair shops, recovery of organic equipment, and recovery support to bsb units and elements in the bsa. unit recovery policies should be itemized in the battalion and brig ade’s sops and mission orders. the field maintenance company also has bdar responsibility to units in the bsa and can provide limited assistance to the fscs. bdar is the rapid return of disabled equipment to the force through field-expedient repair of components. bdar restores minimum essential combat capabilities to support the mission or to enable self-recovery. see fm 4-30.31, recovery and battle damage assessment and repair , for more information. 4-14. the fires brigade field maintenance company has a wh eeled vehicle repair section that provides the capabilities for automotive repair of wheeled vehicles. the wheeled vehicle repair section provides field maintenance for the organic wheeled vehicles in the fire s brigade and all supported units within the bsa. it is managed by the maintenance control section (mcs). the wheeled vehicle repair section performs troubleshooting, minor (nonstructural) welding, major and secondary component replacement, wheel assembly, and line replaceable unit replacement as part of its replace forward concept. 4-15. under the direction of the mco, the mcs direct s, controls and supervises the unit’s field maintenance mission and activities. the section oversees the quality of work and maintains a shop stock/bench stock for shop operations. they also pe rform maintenance management and production control functions for units operating within the bsa. the mc s is best located near the distribution company’s multi-class ssa. the mcs is the manager for all field maintenance and recovery mission actions within the bsa. chapter 4 4-4 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 4-16. maintenance management in the bct requires coordination and collaboration between the spo, fsc and the mco. while the brigade co mmander and the xo are accountable for their unit readiness, the field maintenance company mco provides control, coordinatio n, overall management of maintenance assets and collection for maintenance and readiness data. the spo tracks maintenance, supply data and trends, provides guidance to the mco on priorities as th ey are passed down from the brigade commander. 4-17. the mcs operates automated mainte nance systems to support the bct. it also serves as the main collection point for all maintenance records prior to being sent to the bsb spo staff. the army maintenance management system describes the fo rms and records required to perform field level maintenance. the field maintenance company or shop sops should outline procedures established by the bct to provide accountability of equi pment in for repair. for more de tails about the army maintenance system, refer to da pam 750-8, the army maintenance management system . 4-18. the mcs maintains combat spares and uses controlled component substitution and cannibalized spares obtained from non-repairable vehicles. repair cycle time is expedited and maintenance is simplified by leveraging diagnostics/prognostics technology to identify major component failures and then replace the components. these components include line replaceabl e units, major assemblies, and other subcomponents. refer to ar 750-1, army material maintenance policy and ar 710-2, supply policy below the national level , for more information on parts accountability. 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 5-1

superv ises its organic and attached medical augmentation elements. the bsmc locates a nd establishes its company headquarters and a brigade role 2 medical treatment fac ility in the bsa. this chapter describes the role, organization, employment, and operations of the bsmc. role 5-1. the role of the bsmc is to provide ahs support to all units operating within the bsa. the bsmc operates a role 2 medical facility and provides ahs support on an area basis to all bct units that do not have organic medical assets. the bsmc oversees its organic elements and maintains operational control of medical augmentation elements. the bsmc may be augmented with a forward surgical capability when required based upon mission requiremen ts or mett-tc. refer to fm 4-02, army health system , and fm 4-02.6, the medical company , for more information. organization 5-2. the bsmcs organic to the ibct, abct, and sbct consist of a company headquarters, preventive medicine section, behavioral health section, medical treatment platoon, medical evacuation platoon, and a brigade medical supply office. refer to organizational authorization documents for current personnel and equipment authorizations. a typical bsmc organization is shown in figure 5-1. figure 5-1. brigade support medical company chapter 5 5-2 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 operations 5-3. the bsmc receives, triages, treats, and determ ines the disposition of patients based upon their medical condition. the bsmc provides role 2 medical care for the bct. the bmsc provides an increased medical capability with the addition of x-ray, laboratory, combat operational stress control, and dental services and has 20 cots for holding patients up to 72 hours. role 2 care includes all of the capabilities and functions of role 1 care. company headquarters 5-4. the company headquarters section provides unit- level administration, general supply, and cbrn operations support. the company also provides and coordinates medical equipment maintenance for the medical platoons/sections in the bct. 5-5. the bsmc commander advises the bsb commander on medical aspects of battalion operations and on the health of supported personnel. the medical co mpany commander ensures that the medical annex of the oplan includes procedures to process and treat cbrn contaminated casualties and provisions for cbrn collective protective shelter systems and decontamination augmentation. the annex lists provisions for supporting air and ground ambulances, augmenta tion of medical support assets for contingency operations, detainee operations, customer assistance on obtaining class viii, and for medical representation on casualty damage assessment sections. 5-6. the first sergeant is the company’s senior nco and normally its most experi enced soldier. the first sergeant is the commander’s primary logistics and tacti cal advisor. the first sergeant collaborates with the commander and xo to plan, coordinate, and supervis e all logistics activities that support the company mission. the first sergeant is locat ed wherever the duties require. 5-7. the company xo is the principal assistant to the company commander on the tactical employment of the company assets. the basic considerations which infl uence the employment of medical assets within the brigade are dependent on the brigade commander’s plan , the anticipated patient load, expected areas of casualty density, and the medical treatment and evacuation resources available. brigade medical supply office (bmso) 5-8. the bmso can be co-located with the bsb ssa or serve independently as part of the bsmc as a forward distribution point to distribute class viii. the bmso also synchronizes medical logistic support for medical equipment and its maintenance within the bct. the bmso deploys with a three day basic load and preplans resupply sets for the next seven days. th ese resupply sets will be brought in and maintained by the bmso for resupply of the bct as required. 5-9. the bmso will also have limited asl critical line items to support bmsc role 2 medical elements and bct maneuver battalion’s medical platoon role 1 requirements. this asl is a basic load of class viii supply for the bct managed as a safety level an d released to support th e brigade when routine replenishment fails to meet mission requirements or wait times. upon arrival in theater, the bmso will be resupplied by push-packages until line item requisitioning is available. once the automated ordering system is implemented, the bmso will immediately start requisitioning for replacement of consumed line items. these supplies will be routed to the lowest leve l supporting ssa, normally the fsc supporting the maneuver battalion. for more information on medical logistics see fm 4-02.1, army medical logistics . 5-10. critical line items are filled from the asl mainta ined by the bmso when the customer wait time exceeds mission requirements and immedi ate resupply to the unit is require d. routine ordering procedures will resume upon arrival in theater as soon as unclassifi ed internet connectivity is established. upon receipt of a requisition, the supporting ssa will fill and package the items for distribution to the requesting unit. the bmso will receive and account for materiel upon arrival to the distri bution control point located in the bsa. it will then integrate materiel marked for mane uver role 1 medical treatment facility (mtf)/battalion aid station with other critical class viii supplies and nonmedical items to be distributed to the battalions. this materiel will be broken down by classes of supp ly, and class viii packaged materiel will be delivered to the medical platoons/sections' role 1 mtf/battalion aid station where the medical platoon will inventory the received items and close out the order. brigade support medical company 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 5-3 medical treatment operations 5-11. the medical treatment platoon operates the role 2 mtf in the bsa. it also provides limited assets to reinforce supported unit medical sections. the platoon receives, triages, treats, and determine disposition of patients. the treatment platoon also serv es as the alternate cp for the bsmc. 5-12. the medical treatment platoon leader directs, coordinates, and supervises platoon operations based on the bct ahs plan. the platoon leader also directs the activities of the bsmc role 2 mtf and monitors class viii supplies, blood usage, and inventory levels, and keeps the commander informed of critical class viii and blood requirements. the headquarters section is responsible for overseeing platoon operations, patient accountability and statistical reporting functions, and coordination with the bsb spo, bct surgeon and other elements for patient evacuation. 5-13. the medical treatment squad, the area support squad, and the patient-holding squad are required to establish the bsmc role 2 mtf. wh en patients are able to return to duty after having received treatment, the bsmc role 2 mtf coordinates through the bsb s-1, who in turn contacts the respective unit to pick up the soldier or follows established the brigade sop. medical treatment section 5-14. the medical treatment section pr ovides emergency and routine sick call treatment to soldiers assigned or attached to supported units. when positioned with the bsmc, the treatment section personnel work in the role 2 mtf. the medical treatment squads include two treatment teams to provide role 1 medical treatment and augmentation support to bct maneuver battalions, as required. 5-15. the forward medical treatment squad is capable of operating independently for limited periods of time to provide advanced trauma management and sick call, as required. the forward medical treatment squad must be prepared for short notice forward deployment; therefore, personnel, medical equipment sets, and vehicles must be in a state of readiness. 5-16. the area medical treatment squad is the base me dical treatment section of the bsmc role 2 mtf and does not forward deploy. it is identical to the medical treatment squad and will generally include more experienced personnel. area support squad 5-17. there are four different sections in the area suppor t squad; the dental section, the physical therapy section, the laboratory section, and the radiology s ection. the dental section provides operational dental care which consists of emergency dental care and e ssential dental care intended to intercept dental emergencies. this also includes dental consultation and x-ray services. operational dental care is the care given for the relief of pain, elimination of acute infection, control of life-threatening oral conditions such as hemorrhage or respiratory difficulty. treatment of trauma to teeth, jaws, and associat ed facial structures is considered emergency care. it is th e most austere type of care and is available to soldiers engaged in tactical operations. essential care includes dental treat ment necessary for prevention of lost duty time and preservation of fighting strength. 5-18. the physical therapy section plans and supervises physical therapy programs through patient selfreferral or referral from a medical or dental officer or other health professionals in medical settings. the physical therapist provides guidance within the areas of physical fitness, physical training and injury prevention. the physical th erapy staff primarily evaluates and treat s disorders of human motion through the use of physical/chemical therapeutic means. 5-19. the laboratory section performs clinical laboratory and blood banking procedures to aid physicians and physician’s assistants in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. laboratory functions include performing laboratory procedures cons istent with the role 2 treatment capabilities. 5-20. the radiology section provides x-ray equipment consistent with the role 2 treatment capabilities. the section performs routine clinical radiological procedures to aid physicians and physician assistants in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. chapter 5 5-4 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 patient-holding squad 5-21. the patient-holding squad operates the patient-hol ding facility of the bsmc role 2 mtf. the holding facility’s primary role is to hold patients awaiting evacuation; a secondary role is to hold patients who are expected to return to duty within 72 hours. it is staffed and equipped to provide care for up to 20 patients. role 2 facilities do not have an admission capability therefore patients at this facility are not counted as hospital admissions. in addition, the patient-holding facility serves as a patient-overflow recovery area for the forward surgical team. medical reporting 5-22. the ahs uses the medical communications for comb at casualty care system (mc4) that depends on soldiers and care givers in the fiel d to accurately report required informa tion. all of the tools are in place to properly record/report and transmit the required information. casualty reporting is a shared responsibility, the ahs reports to the s/g-1 elements and the s/ g-1 tracks and reports as required/necessary. units coordinate and execute based upon the mission and area of operations ensuring they meet the medical/casualty reporting requirements. evacuation operations 5-23. medical evacuation is always the responsibility of th e higher role of care. for example, role 1 from the point of injury, casualty collection point, or patient collection point to the battalion aid station; role 2 mtfs (the bsmc) provides medical evacuation from the role 1 mtf. even though the role 3 mtf may not have organic medical evacuation capability, it is the responsibility of the role 3 mtf to coordinate that medical evacuation from the role 2 mtf to the role 3 mtf, the combat support hospital. the bct has its own medical evacuation capability from point of injury or casualty collection point and on to the successive roles of care up to role 2. 5-24. the supporting multifunctional medical battalion or medical brigade coordinates for the echelon above brigade ground am bulance company. the ground ambulance co mpany may be attached or assigned to the multifunctional medical battalion for support in the bct area of operations for medical evacuation to the combat support hospital. 5-25. the evacuation platoon performs ground evacuation and en route patient care for the supported units. the evacuation platoon consists of a platoon headquarters, an area support evacuation section, and a forward evacuation section. platoon assets are located where they can best resp ond to requirements. the evacuation platoon leader maintains communications in order to direct ground evacuation of patients. the platoon provides ground ambulance evacuation support for the bct maneuver battalions and to other units receiving area medical support from the bsmc. 5-26. the platoon leader and platoon sergeant establish and maintain contact with supported units and forward deployed treatment squads/teams of the bsmc. they perform route reconnaissance and develop and issue all necessary route and navigational inform ation, to include graphi c control measures. they receive evacuation requests from supported units and coordinate and establish ambulance exchange points for both air and ground ambulances. see fm 4-02.2, medical evacuation , for medical evacuation/casualty evacuation information. 5-27. the evacuation squads provide ground ambulance evacuation of patients from the bsa and forward areas to the bsmc role 2 mtf. evacuation squad personnel perform emergency medical treatment, evacuate patients, and provide for their continued car e en route. they maintain supply levels for the ambulance medical equipment sets and ensure that appr opriate property exchange s of medical items (such as litters and blankets) are made at sending and receiving role 2 mtfs. preventive medicine 5-28. commanders are responsible for protecting their soldiers from disease non-battle injury, and must emphasize and enforce high standards of field sanitation and personal hygiene. preventive medicine support can be found throughout the bct and the bsmc. effective preventive medicine operations are characterized by preemptive actions. l ack of or delay in implementing preemptive actions can significantly brigade support medical company 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 5-5 impact the deployed force’s ability to accomplish its assigned mission. refer to da pam 40-11, preventive medicine , fm 21-10, field hygiene and sanitation , and fm 4-25.12, unit field sanitation teams for additional information. 5-29. the preventive medicine section is primarily responsible for identifying health threats and occupational/environmental health hazards, assessing th e health risk associated with these threats, and recommending protective measures. under the oversight of the brigade surgeon, the preventive medicine section monitors and guides implementation of the brigade preventive medicine program. they also provide training to bct soldiers in disease non-battle injury prevention programs. the preventive medicine section develops and coordinates a preventive medicine circulation plan throughout the brigade’s area of operations in order to monitor supported battalions. review fm 4-02.17, preventive medicine services , for more information about unit preventive medicine programs. behavioral health 5-30. the behavioral health section/combat and opera tional stress control team assists commanders with controlling combat and operational stress through prevention programs. the combat operational stress control team operates under the di rection of the bsmc commander and provides brigade-wide behavioral health and combat operational stress control services. deployed combat operational stress control activities include continual soldier assessment and consultation with medical and other personnel associated with deployed soldiers. it assists and counsels personnel with personal, behavioral, or psychological problems and participates in the early identif ication of mild traumatic brain injury. the behavior health section does not treat ongoing cases. see fm 4-02.51, combat and operational stress control , for more details. 5-31. the company behavioral health section normally locates with the bsmc ro le 2 mtf as the center for its operations, but is mobile throughout the brigade’s area. the section’s priority functions are to promote positive stress behaviors, prev ent unnecessary evacuatio ns, and coordinate retu rn of soldiers to duty. the section keeps abreast of the tactical situ ation and plans and projects requirements for combat operational stress control support through the compan y commander and evacuation pl atoon leaders. combat operational stress control support is routinely conducted when units are pulled back for rest and recuperation. for definitive information on combat operational stress control operations, see fm 6-22.5, combat and operational stress control manual for leaders and soldiers . this page intentionally left blank . 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 6-1 chapter 6 aviation support battalion the aviation support battalion (asb) provides support to both the combat aviation brigades (cab) and theater aviation brig ades. cab’s synchronize operations of multiple aviation battalions that are task organized to provide reconnaissance, security, close combat attack, interdiction, air assault, and air movement operations in support of ground forces under the headquart ers to which it is assigned. the cab is tailored for the mission, containing both manned and unmanned systems, and can support multiple brigade combat teams. role 6-1. the asb is the primary aviation logistics organization in the cab and the theater aviation brigade. it is optimized to support the cab’s forward support company/troops, aviation maintenance companies/troops and the brigade’s hhc. the asb provid es distribution of classes i, ii, iii (b), iv, v, and ix, water storage, and operates an athp. it also provides field level maintenance. organization 6-2. the asb consists of four comp anies; the headquarters and supp ort company, the distribution company, the aviation suppo rt company, and the network support company. the asb is configured differently from other bsbs. the headquarters and support company provides the field maintenance and ahs support to the brigade. the fscs and aviation maintenance companies are organic to aviation brigade battalions, not the asb. figure 6-1 depicts an example of an aviation support battalion. figure 6-1. aviation support battalion operations 6-3. the headquarters and support company maintenance platoon primarily supports the asb’s assigned companies and aviation brigade headquarters. the ma intenance platoon oversees the field maintenance chapter 6 6-2 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 activities throughout the company, performs the maintenance management and production control functions and maintains the class ix. the field maintenance section conducts ground recovery operations and provides maintenance evacuation for the brigade. the platoon also has automotive, power generation, allied trades and small arms repairmen. 6-4. the medical platoon has the medical assets to conduct ahs support at a role 1 medical treatment facility for the cab. the platoon is organized into headquarters, treatment, and evacuation sections. the brigade hhc and flight battalions retain their organic flight surgeons and medics in their organic medical treatment team. the medical platoon provides the following capabilities for the asb:  tactical combat casualty care and acute trau ma management for wounded and disease and nonbattle injury patients.  sick call services.  ground ambulance evacuation from supported units.  mass casualty triage and management.  limited patient decontamination. 6-5. the distribution company provides supply classes i, ii, iii, iv v, and water. the distribution company provides aircraft fueling an d serves as the supply support activ ity warehouse for class ix air and ground parts. the distribution company is also responsible for all aircraft and ground asset refueling, and assists in the setup and management of the forward arming and refueling point. the petroleum platoon has a two person quartermaster petroleum team assigned to provide quality assurance testing for bulk aviation fuel. this is a critical tool for the aviators because it provides organic support for aircraft petroleum testing. 6-6. the aviation support company provides field mainte nance, and support for on-aircraft and critical off-aircraft maintenance of unmanned aircraft system s. the aviation support co mpany also conducts bdar and provides backup support to the aviation maintenance companies. emphasis is on component replacement. damaged or inoperable ai rcraft requiring time-consuming repa ir actions are handled in more secure areas toward the rear . training circular 3-04.7, army aviation maintenance , provides more detail about aviation maintenance. 6-7. the asb executes replenishment operations for the fsc/forward support troops and the aviation maintenance companies/troops in concert with the cab’s operational plan. the fsc works closely with the brigade aviation maintenance officer and spo in the procurement of cla ss ix parts and acts as the direct link to sustainment maintenance program representatives. 6-8. an fsc is assigned to each operational aviation batta lion and consists of a headquarters platoon, distribution platoon, and ground maintenance platoon. the fsc provides enhanced aircraft logistics and ground maintenance capabilities. the fsc coordinates with the asb for additional logistics as required. the fsc could be located either in the supported batta lion area or in the bsa to facilitate logistics support from the brigade support area to the battalion area of operations. the following capabilities are provided by the fsc:  field maintenance for all organic equipment  refueling and rearming support. each of the forward arming and refueling points can be task organized to support continuous operations by providing support for maintenance, armament, rearming and refueling  field feeding capabilities.  transportation assets to support logistics, recovery, and movement of personnel and equipment.  transportation of all classes of supply.  replenishment operations. 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 7-1 chapter 7 forward support company forward support companies provide direct s upport to brigade combat teams, fires, aviation, and maneuver enhancement brig ades. the fscs are the link from the bsb to the supported battalions and are the organization that provides the brigade, battalion, and bsb commanders the greatest flexibility for providing logistics support to the brigade. fsc’s are organic to the bs bs in brigade combat teams. they provide field feeding, field maintenance and distribution support to their supported battalions. fscs provide the bsb commander the ability to prioritize the logistics effort in support of decisive operations. this chapter describes the fsc role, organization, and operations of the fsc. it also describes organizational differences in the various types of fscs. role 7-1. the role of the fsc is to provide direct logi stics support to the supported battalion. the fsc provides the supported commander with dedicated logi stics assets organized specifically to meet the battalion’s requirements. an fsc provides field feeding, bulk fuel, general supply, ammunition, and field maintenance. the fsc commander receives technical logistics oversight and mentoring from the bsb commander. fsc commanders must have a continuous relationship with the bsb spo. the bsb commander will utilize the spo to ensure that all fsc commanders understand the bsb commanders brigade logistics support plan. 7-2. the fscs are normally organic to the bct bsbs and are critical to the success of the logistic concept of support. how the fscs are deployed is cr itical to the success of the bct. depending on the current operation and situation an fsc, for limited dura tion, may be attached to or placed under operational control (opcon) of its supported battalion. fsc attach ment or opcon to its supported battalion is limited in duration and may be for a specific mission or phase of an operation. they can also remain under the direct control of the bsb. the decision to establish these types of command relationships is made by the brigade commander upon the advice of the bsb commander after careful and thorough mission analysis. there is no configuration that works in every situ ation. the commander must make a conscious decision for each mission under the unique circumstances of th e operational environment. there is not a generic template. the commander must weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each method of deployment and act decisively. organization 7-3. the fscs in the various bcts are structured simila rly with the most significant differences in maintenance capabilities. the bsb provides support to the maneuver battalions through the fsc; it resources the fsc to set the logistics conditions necessary to ensure maneuver success. the abct/ibct/sbct fsc is organic to the bsb and not autonomous from the bsb by design. 7-4. the fscs are organized to support the combined arms battalions, stryker, fires battalion and the reconnaissance squadron. the fsc depends upon the brigade support battalion and other units for the support areas listed below. as the fscs command relationship or support relationship shifts to and from the bsb and the supported battalion, these dependencies must be addressed, agreed upon, and formalized by a brigade level order.  human resources support.  religious support. chapter 7 7-2 atp 4-90 2 april 2014  logistics cop input.  battlefield intelligence.  resupply assets to maintain the required quantity of materiel required to push forward to the supported battalion.  roles 1 and 2 ahs support.  water distribution to the fsc and its maneuver battalion.  reporting requirements. 7-5. the fsc is dependent on the bsb for multiple functions and capabilities. in addition to those already highlighted, the field maintenance company provides training and senior warrant officer/nco mentorship for low density military occupational specialties in the fsc. 7-6. the fscs have a headquarters section, a distribution platoon, and a maintenance platoon. the headquarters’ food service section provides class i support. this section provides food service and food preparation for the supported battalion. the food serv ice section prepares, serves and distributes the full range of operational rations. figure 7-1 is an example of an ibct/abct/sbct fsc. figure 7-1. forward support company supporting a combined arms battalion 7-7. the distribution platoon consists of a platoon headquarters, and four squads that can be task organized to distribute class ii, iii, iv, v, and vii. the maintenance platoons vary based upon the equipment and major weapon systems of the supported battalion. generally, the maintenance platoon consists of a platoon headquarters, maintenance cont rol section, field maintenance section, service and recovery section and the field maintenance teams (fmts). 7-8. the fires brigade fscs are separate companies. they are normally assigned to the bsb and attached or opcon to the artillery battalion for the duration of an operation, or as determined by the brigade commander. the fires brigade fscs differ depending on the type of artillery they support but are designed to provide the same functions of any fsc. figure 7-2 depicts an example of an fsc supporting a fires brigade. operations 7-9. the fsc commander commands the fsc and is the senior logistician at battalion level for the maneuver or support battalion. the fsc commander assists the supported battalion s-4 with the battalion logistics planning and is responsi ble for executing the logistics plan in accordance with the supported forward support company 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 7-3 battalion commanders’ intent. the fsc forms the battalion echelon of support, often referred to as battalion trains. 7-10. the fsc commander must know and understand the capabilities and limitations of the company’s personnel and equipment in performing the sustainment mission. he must also thoroughly understand the different types of army command and support relationships. this knowledge coupled with logistic expertise enables the fsc commander to make credible re commendations to both the supported maneuver commander and the bsb commander. adrp 5-0, the operations process , explains command and support relationships. figure 7-2. forward support company supporting fires brigade 7-11. the fsc commander must have the mental ability to shape and be shaped by changing operational and mission variables. as the operational and mission variables evolve, the fscs relationship with its supported battalion will change. whatever the command/support relationship is, the fsc is an extension of the bsb and a critical element to the bsb and bct co mmanders’ ability to weight the logistic effort. the bsb commander and staff provide technical oversight and coordinate support to the fscs. both the logistics and maneuver battalion commanders will influence the fsc commander in different ways at different times. 7-12. the fsc commander can be located in a variety of locations based on mett-tc. fsc commanders locate where they can best command the fsc and communicate with appropri ate bsb or supported battalion staff. additional discussion of echelons of suppor t is in appendix a of this atp and is included in fm 3-90.6, brigade combat team, as well as the respective brigade field manuals. supply operations 7-13. the distribution platoon leader leads the platoon, oversees logpac operations and manages the distribution of supplies coming from or passing through the fsc in support of the bct units. replenishment operations are conducted by the distribution platoon. the platoon provides general supplies, fuel, and ammunition to the supported battalion. fuel storage, water purification capability and additional transportation assets are centralized within cssbs. the bsb spo will coordinate with the sustainment brigade to ensure th is support is in place. for additional information about the sustainment brigade and cssb capabilities see atp 4-93, sustainment brigade . 7-14. the distribution platoon can be task organized into battalion and company support squads. the support squad provides all supplies for a supported battalion employing companies in a widely dispersed geographic area. chapter 7 7-4 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 7-15. the class iii section provides retail class iii bulk fuel distribution to the supported battalion and provides refueling options in support of the bct units passing through the supported battalion ao. the bsb distribution company pushes fu el to the fsc and the fsc pushes fuel to the maneuver battalion using fsc distribution assets. 7-16. the class v section provides the distribution of ammunition to the supported battalion and conducts ammunition resupply replenishment operations in support of bct units. the fsc class v operation is basically a transloading operation; the distribution company pushes the class v to the fsc and the fsc pushes it to the maneuver battalion on fsc distribution assets. field maintenance operations 7-17. the maintenance platoon performs field maintenance as well as all maintenance management functions, dispatching, and scheduled service operations for the supported battalion and fsc. the platoon consists of the platoon headquarters section, maintena nce control section, mainte nance section, service and recovery section, and the fmts. the fsc maintenan ce platoon coordinates all maintenance requirements with the fsc commander. the maintenance platoon also performs field maintenance on fsc and supported battalion’s hhc vehicles and equipment. 7-18. fsc maintenance priorities are determined by the supported battalion’s chain of command with recommendations from the fsc commander and the mco. the maintenance platoon’s first priority is to reinforce the fmts mission. maintenance platoon l eaders are responsible for leading the platoon and controlling and directing the accomplishment of the pl atoon’s mission. they are responsible to the mco for ensuring the completion of mainte nance jobs and adhering to priority of support as provided. attp 433, maintenance operations provides details of maintenance functions. bdar procedures can be found in fm4-30.31, recovery and battle damage assessment and repair (bdar). maintenance control section (mcs) 7-19. the mcs is the management center for all maintenance actions in the fsc and supported battalion. the mcs performs maintenance management functions, dispatching operations, and tracks scheduled services for the maneuver battalion and fsc. the mcs has a small supply section which provides class ix support including shop stock and bench stock for shop operations. it also provides exchange of reparable items. 7-20. the maintenance control officer an d the fsc’s automation systems are co-located in the mcs. the mco uses them to produce the army materiel status system readiness reports and to analyze and assess maintenance status. the mco is responsible for preparing the readiness report for the maneuver commander. the mcs tracks the calls for support and logistics task orders generated through fbcb2. 7-21. the mco serves as maintenance officer for the supported battalion and fsc. mcos are the senior maintenance representative in the mcp and are responsible for managi ng the mcs, maintenance section, service and recovery section, and the field maintena nce teams. the recovery section provides recovery support to elements of the fsc. this section also provides limited reinforcing recovery support to fmts. 7-22. the mcs controls and assigns work to the mcp. task organization of the mcp’s maintenance operation is modified based on the mco’s analysis of maintenance requirements and the tactical situation. equipment that requires sustainment level maintenan ce is evacuated to a national level provider. this requires coordination between the fsc mc s, brigade staff and the spo staff. field maintenance teams (fmt) 7-23. the supported battalion’s first level of maintena nce support comes from the fsc fmts that are organized to provide field maintenance for all combat platforms in the supported unit. the fmts provide field maintenance and bdar to maneuver companies. all or part of an fmt goes with the company teams. 7-24. the supported company commander and the mcs se t the fmt’s priorities in accordance with the battalion commander’s guidance. the fmt operates under the operational control of the maneuver company and is supervised by the fmt’s maintenance non-commissioned officer in charge. fmts are fully integrated into the maneuver unit’s operational plans. forward support company 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 7-5 fmts perform repairs as far forward as possible, returning equipment to the battle quickly. during combat, fmts perform bdar, diagnostics, and on-system replacement of line replaceable units. if the tactical situation permits, fmts focus on completing jobs on site. fmts carry limited on board combat spares to facilitate repairs forward. the fsc’s maintenance plat oon provides reinforcing maintenance to the fmts. this page intentionally left blank . 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 8-1 chapter 8 mission command and logistic reporting bsb mission command is complex. the commander monitors and supports decisive action tasks across the brigade area of operations. bsb command posts, mission command systems and logistic information systems enable the bsb to efficiently interface with others and conduct sustai nment operations. accurate and timely reporting can mean the difference between mission success and failure. the entire logistical scheme only works when an accurate logistic status is part of the common operating picture. key logistic informa tion systems can assist with developing a logistic common operating picture. section i – mission command 8-1. mission command is the exercise of authority and direction by the commander using mission orders to enable disciplined initiative within the commander’s intent to empower agile and adaptive leaders in the conduct of unified land operations (adp 6-0). mission command is enabled through extracting information from multiple sources, personnel and processes. operations process 8-2. both the commander and staff have important roles within the operations process. the commander’s role is to drive the operations process through the activities of understanding, visualizing, describing, directing, leading, and assessing operations. the bsb commander visualizes the nature and design of operations through estimates and input from subordinates. the commander describes support operations in terms of time, space, resources, purpose, and actio n, employing intent, ccir, and mission orders for planning, preparation, and mission execution. 8-3. the staff’s role is to assist commanders with understanding situations, making and implementing decisions, controlling operations, and assessing progre ss. the bsb commander and staff must be familiar with army design methodology, the mdmp, and troop leading procedures. adrp 5-0, the operations process , and attp 5-0.1, commanders and staff officer guide , describe planning methodologies, as well as, the key components of a plan or order. integrating processes and continuing activities 8-4. the bsb commander and staff synchronize within the warfighting functions to accomplish missions throughout the operations process. synchronization is the arrangement of actions in time, space and purpose to produce maximum relative combat power at a decisive place and time (jp 2-0). integration is combining all of the elements of sustainment (task, functions, systems, processes, organizations) to operations assuring unity of command of effort (adp 4-0). before commanders can effectively synchronize activities or events they must integrate activities. 8-5. integrating processes combine me mbers from across the staff to help synchronize operations. for example, the mdmp fosters a shared understanding of the situation as it develops a synchronized plan or order to accomplish a mission. the mdmp not only in tegrates the actions of the commander, staff, subordinate commanders and other but also integrates several processes such as intelligence preparation of the battlefield, close air support and risk management. commanders and staff integrate the warfighting function through command post cells. chapter 8 8-2 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 8-6. the bsb staff uses planning guidance to prep are estimates. the bsb commander and staff plan continuously. in an ambiguous environment, the commander's initial planning guidance should not limit the staff's development of mission analysis and refinement of their running estimates. each staff section should maintain a continuous baseline of running estimates that can be modified based on the results of the mission analysis. yet, it is not until they receive th e supported commander’s d ecision on the tactical employment of brigade units that they finalize the concept of operations. working with the brigade staff, the bsb staff develops the logis tics and ahs concept of support. 8-7. after reviewing running estimates, the commander offe rs personal estimates of the situation, reviews the course of action analysis and decides the course of action that best supports the supported brigade’s mission. the process is a continuous one; the support battalion commander and staff are always involved in estimating and planning. however, the focus becomes more precise when the support battalion receives a mission. planning 8-8. using the brigade s-4’s requirements and the commande rs priorities, the bsb staff determines what type, quantity and priority of logistics and ahs suppor t is required and available, where these resources are located and when they are available to supported units. such logistics and ahs support planning is as detailed as time permits. planning concentrates on those areas most vital to successful mission accomplishment of the supported brigade. refer to adrp 5-0, the operations process , for an explanation of the plans to operations transition and transition among staff integrating cells. 8-9. one of the areas the bsb pays close attention to during the planning process is the command and support relationships established throughout the phase s of the operation. the command relationships drive the units the bsb supports and those relationships change depending on the phase of a particular operation. adrp 5-0, the operations process , and attp 5-0.1, commanders and staff officer guide , provide tables and text describing the different command and support relationships. 8-10. the bsb commander’s intent, formalized in the order and understood at the company level provides subordinates with the broad idea behind the operation an d allows them to act promptly as the situation requires. subordinate commanders focus their orders on the purpose of tasks and the operation as a whole rather than the detail. orders and plan s are as brief and simple as possible. 8-11. the concept of support is a verbal or graphi c statement of how the bsb commander intends to support and integrate bsb sustainment operations with a concept of operations in an operation. the broad concept of support is paragraph four of the oplan/opord with subparagraphs for logistics, personnel and ahs support. however, more detailed information and instructions about the concept of support are found in annex f (sustainment) of the oplan/opord. an example of a sustainment annex is in attp 5-0.1, commander and staff officer guide . 8-12. after the current operations s3 distributes the oplan/opord, the bsb commander and staff supervise its execution. the primary purpose of the staff is to assist subordinate units to carry out the intent of the support battalion commanders’ order. the bsb staff refines plans and orders as the situation changes. information comes back to the command section through reports and personal observations of the battalion/company commanders and st aff. on the basis of this information, the bsb staff evaluates instructions as required. 8-13. logistical and operational planning occurs simultaneously rather than sequentially. incremental adjustments to either the maneuver or logistics plan during its execution must be visible to all supported brigade elements. conduct adjustments to the logis tics plan during the brigad e sustainment rehearsal. following the rehearsal, the bsb spo and bsb s-3 re view additional planning guidance issued by the commander and modify the plan as n ecessary. significant changes may re quire assistance from the spo to include moving someone to the s-3 cell until the changes are completed. the sustainment rehearsal should be led by the bsb commander and the brigade xo. 8-14. participating in mission rehearsals and sand tabl e exercises are an excellent means to better understand the support requirements. ideally, the bsb spo briefs the concept of support at the brigade mission rehearsal. this ensures all concerned understand the concept of support and have an opportunity to mission command and logistic reporting 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 8-3 ask questions and clarify areas of confusion. anticipatory logistics depends on a thorough understanding of the mission requirements. the change from one type of operation to another, such as from a hasty attack to a pursuit, does not require a major shift in logistic s plans and procedures. however, the priorities and requirements for support may change. 8-15. the plans-to-operations transition is a preparation activity that occurs within the bsb headquarters. this transition is especially important to the bsb spo and the bsb s-3. the purpose of the transition is to ensure both the bsb spo and s-3 understand the plan prior to execution. the responsibility for developing and maintaining the plan shifts from the spo (future operations) to the s-3 (current operations). this transition is the point at which the s-3 becomes respon sible for controlling execution of the operation order. this responsibility includes answering requests for in formation concerning the order and maintaining the order through fragmentary orders. the bsb spo normally conducts a mission brief and allows time for the s-3 to understand the plan in order to coordinate the execution and to identify questions about the plan. 8-16. the operations logistics (oplog) planner is a web-based interactive tool that assists commanders and staff from strategic through operational levels in developing a logistics estimate. it is designed to support operations typically associated with multi-phase operations plans and orders. the oplog planner enables staffs to develop estimated mission requirement s for supply class i, class ii, class iii(p), class iv, class vi, class vii, class x, including water, ice, and ma il. the tool uses the latest army approved planning rates and force structures. it is updated at least annu ally to stay current with force structure and rate changes. 8-17. oplog planner allows planners to build multiple task organizations from a preloaded list of units and equipment or from custom built units that are generated or imported. the planners have the option of using predefined default planning rates or customizing rates based on what a unit is experiencing. oplog planner generates the logistics supply requirements which can be viewed in a variety of ways. logistics requirement reports can be printed or exported to auto mated spread sheets for further analysis or saved for recall to be used in course of action analysis. command posts (cp) 8-18. there are three types of command post; main co mmand post, tactical command post and early entry command post. the main command post consists of the majority of the staff. they control current operations, conduct detailed analysis and plan future operations (attp 5-0.1). the tactical command post contains a tailored portion of a unit headquarter desi gned to control portions of an operation for a limited time (attp 5-0.1). an early entry command post is the lead element of a head quarters designed to control operations until the remainder of the headquarters are operational (attp 5-0.1). the bsb is staffed for a main cp. resourcing for additional command posts would be from the existing brigade support battalion positions. this is a critical point to remember since the bsb cp does not have the organic capability to mission command on the move, they lose many capabilit ies they have when stationary. the bsb should establish procedures to transfer command post control responsibilities to another cp during moves. refer to attp 5-0.1, commander and staff officer guide , for more information about command posts. command post operations 8-19. some key functions in any cp include orders ma nagement, running estimates and establishing a deliberate process for information flow. these are especially important to maintaining situational understanding of the distribution operations for the supported brigade. there are a lot of people involved in sustainment operations that may not be in the bsb or even in the supported brigade. the commander and staff should also consider the role of any liaison staff elements; if the liaison will be in the cp, the tasks the commander expects the liaison to do and if the liaison officers require access to the local area network or power. the commander may also consider if the bsb should send any liaisons from the bsb to other organizations. 8-20. the staff must communicate any activity that imp acts sustainment operations. as part of command post operations, the staff roles include gathering and analyzing information and making recommendations to the commander. c ommander’s critical information requirement is an information requirement identified by the commander as being critical to facilitating timely decision making (adrp 1-02). the staff chapter 8 8-4 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 determines what information is important and how quickly it must be conveyed to the commander. adrp 5-0, the operations process, provides description of ccir and the two categories of commander’s critical information requirements; priority intelligence requirem ents and friendly force information requirements. some things the bsb staff can do to improve sustainment support are-  identify assumptions that affect the sustainment function or the bsb unit and develop ccir related to those assumptions.  develop means of observation or reporting to track ccir.  issue and execute fragmentary or ders in response to ccir. 8-21. sound sops and contingency plans greatly assist in the development of specific plans. when sops are comprehensive, they have to change only to accommodate specific requireme nts or circumstances. the bsb’s sop should complement the supported brigade’s sop. some areas that th e bsb’s cp sop should include are standard cp layout, battle drills, battle rhythm, communications, reporting procedures and report formats. the most successf ul units follow and revise sops throughout training and mission execution. 8-22. effective cp operations require frequent training th at includes establishing and practicing staff battle drills. the number and sophistication of bsb staff battle dr ills vary by organization. they are as diverse as the personalities of the bsb commande rs. a useful battle drill is a bsb cp displacement drill that directs how to displace the cp within established time periods, 12 hour notice, 24 hour notice, or 48 hour notice. battle drills only work when everyone associated with the cp understands and practices the drills. battle drills can be trained and practiced in a variety of locations. 8-23. the commander considers the size, location and mobility requirements of the cp and then configures the command post. an example bsb command post layout is depicted in figure 8-1. this example uses equipment that is authorized by modified table of organization and equipment or common table of allowances. commanders may add or take equipmen t and space away depending on the factors of metttc variables. figure 8-1. example brigade support battalion cp 8-24. keep in mind, the more complicated the cp design, the longer it will take to set-up and displace. cp mobility improves cp survivability, especially at the company and battalion level. a smaller size and careful transportation planning allow cps to displace rapidly to avoid the enemy. 8-25. there are multiple work areas in the exampl e bsb cp. many commanders display critical information on boards or other visual means. some topics that could be displayed in the battle staff area mission command and logistic reporting 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 8-5 are: priority information requirements, ccir, cbrn conditions, various personnel or logistic status reports, concept of support, battle rhythm, orders, and a synch matrix. command post cells 8-26. most cp functions directly relate to assessi ng and directing ongoing operations, planning future operations or supporting the force. to promote coordination and synchronization, commanders cross-functionally organize elements of staff sections in command posts and cp cells. the bsb staff was designed to allow for cross-functionality inter-action between the staff sections. 8-27. while each echelon and type of unit organizes cps di fferently, two types of cp cells exist: functional and integrating cells. functional cells group personnel and equipment by war fighting function. integrating cells group personnel and equipment by planning hori zon. staff interactions will change as operations evolve and task organize as the operations dictate. 8-28. the xo normally leads and provides staff supervision of the cp. attp 5-0.1, commander and staff officer guide , includes information about command post organization, operations and functional and integrating cp cells. 8-29. the bsb receives joint network node support from the brigade signal company. the brigade allocates joint network node resources according to mett-tc. the bsb’s co mbat service support automated information systems interf ace is used to set up wireless local area networks from the bsb to its supporting brigade and sustainment organizations. it connects all logistics information systems, including those used by maneuver units. this means that any unit in the bsa will be able to use the internet. 8-30. the combat service support very small aperture terminal system is a satellite communications system designed to provide worldwide data and voice communications connectivity. the bsb’s very small aperture terminal system provides the means to establish connectivity, constant communication and access to the non-classified internet protocol router netw ork from any location where a satellite signal can be transmitted and received. digitized mission command systems 8-31. a mission command system is the arrangement of personnel, information management, procedures, and equipment and facilities essential for the commander to conduct operations. commanders cannot exercise mission command alone except in the simplest and smallest of units. even at the lowest levels, commanders need support to exercise mission command effectively. at every echelon of command, each commander has a mission command system to prov ide support. digitized mission command systems provide data and facilitate situational understanding by establishing a common operating picture (cop). 8-32. logisticians, human resources and ahs support personnel draw on actionable data provided by mission command warfighting function system platforms to determine the sustainability and supportability of current and planned operations. these systems provide near real time logistics, human resource, and medical information that link the bct to the sustainm ent brigade and theater planners. these systems also enable staff officers and commande rs to quickly and more accurate ly plan logistics operations. 8-33. effective bsb logistics operations are dependent on a high level of situational understanding. situational understanding enables the bsb commander and staff to maintain visibility of current and projected requirements, to synchronize distribution op erations and to maintain integrated visibility of transportation and supplies. logistic ians maintain situational understanding of the battlefield via battle command sustainment support system (bcs3), analog systems, and improvised redundant digital systems such as force xxi battle command brigade and below (fbcb2) blue force tracker, movement tracking system, command post of the future, and non-classified internet protocol router or secret internet protocol router. these systems enable sustainment commanders and battle staffs to exercise centralized mission command warfighting function tasks, anticipate support requirements, and maximize battlefield distribution. 8-34. logisticians manage the destination, speed, and volume of the distribution system. with in-transit visibility, total asset visibility, advanced materiel management, and advanced decision support system technology, logisticians have access to and visibility over all items within the distribution system. this chapter 8 8-6 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 enables a logisticians ability to divert, cross-level, and mass assets anywhere, anytime to support the maneuver commander. battle command sustainment support system (bcs3) 8-35. bcs3 receives data from logistics information sy stems (including gcss-a rmy (f/t)), other bcs3 terminals, other army battle command system devices including fbcb2, and manual input by operators. users of bcs3 are able to obtain mission command information (such as the friendly and enemy situations) from other army battle command system devices. sim ilarly, other army battle command system devices are able to view the same friendly logistics status as are on bcs3. this enab les all army battle command system users to maintain a logistics cop. 8-36. the bcs3 logistics reporting tool provides a bottoms-up logistics status input to the bct commander’s bcs3 combat power report and populates the dashboard of a command post of the future workstation. the bcs3 logistics reporting tool incorporates repair parts and supply status starting at the company level. the intent of bcs3 is to identify sh ortages at the lowest level first then project the requirement to the next higher command and the support unit. the logistics reporting tool format incorporates organizational and direct support data on the same report to enable logisticians to fix issues at the lowest levels. the logistics reporting tool enab les users to input and access data locally. information about bcs3 and sample logistics reporting tool and combat power reports are available in the bcs3 users or operators manual. 8-37. the bcs3 combat power tool shows asset readiness by user-specified class of supply and tracked items list. the combat power report also allows the user to switch between logistics information systems (lis) such as standard army retail supply system, standard army ammunition system, and gcss-army (f/t), input and more timely and accurate logistic s reporting tool logistics status. these commodity reports are available in bcs3 for all classes of supply with an automated source of data. these require no additional reporting on the part of the user, other than their daily transactions on the lis. additional reports such as the maintenance readiness report, munitions report and petroleum report should not be added to reporting requirements to subordinate units below divi sion-level if lis and logis tics reporting tool satisfy information requirements. force xxi battle command brigade and below (fbcb2) 8-38. fbcb2 forms the principal digital mission command system for the army at brigade and below. fbcb2 systems hardware and software are integrated in to various platforms at brigade and below, as well as appropriate division and corps elements necessary to support brigade operations. all fbcb2 systems are interconnected through a communications infrastructure to exchange data which improves situational understanding. this data exchange enhances the commander’s ability to conduct mission command warfighting function tasks. 8-39. fbcb2, positioned on specified platforms, performs combat, combat service, and logistics functions for the planning and execution of operations. logistics organizations are digitally linked to the platforms and organizations that they support. fbcb2 provides a cop enabling logistics providers to maintain the operational tempo set by maneuver commanders. 8-40. fbcb2 assists lower level commanders to automate the sustainment data-gathering process. it does this through logistics situation reports, personnel situatio n reports, logistical call for support, logistics task order messaging, and task management. this functionality affects the synchronization of all logistics support on the battlefield between the supported and the supporter. section ii – logistic reporting 8-41. the intent of this section is to address the following frequently asked questions:  what is a logistic status report?  who reports logistic information?  what information is reported?  what is the distribution of reports? mission command and logistic reporting 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 8-7  what is the frequency of reports?  who is responsible for acting on information? 8-42. logistic status reports are detailed enough to be useful but simple enough for everyone to prepare and understand. logistic reporting can easily become an overwhelming task for the staff and result in information overload for the brigade commander. report s may be in different formats, but every leader must know the status of equipment and of on hand supplies particularly ammunition, food and fuel. in order to provide support, bsb commanders, in conjunction with the brigade s-4, use a logistics status report to coordinate with supporting and supported units. the logistics status report enables the higher command and support units to make timely decisions, prioritize, cr oss level and synchronize the distribution of supplies to sustain units at their authorized levels. 8-43. the logistics status report is an internal status report that identifies logistics requirements, provides visibility on critical shortages, allows commanders an d staff to project mission capability, and informs the common operating picture. accurately reporting the logistic and ahs support status is essential for keeping units combat ready. brigade sops establish report formats, reporting times, and redundancy requirements. 8-44. the logistics status report is the primary product used throughout the brigade and at higher levels of command to provide a logistics snapshot of current stock status, on-hand quantities, and future requirements. the logistics status report is a compila tion of data that requires analysis before action. providing the commander a bunch of numbers with percentages and colors is useless. the commander requires an analysis based on the data along with a recommendation for action. 8-45. the brigade commander’s pr eferences and the mission determine wh at the logistics status report looks like and what it contains. the logistics status re port is customizable to the commander’s preferences and does not have to come from an lis. the format presented to the commander must be easy to understand and act on. 8-46. data collection for the logistics status report is based upon operational and mission variables and should not overwhelm subordinate units with submission requirements. a report that grows too cumbersome will overwhelm staffs and fail in a high operational pace. it is important that this report is standardized throughout the brigade and that all units co nsistently provide input, regardless of their level of support. the brigade s-4 decides the logistics status report format ensuring the data the bsb requires is included. in some cases, the higher level s-4 will determin e the logistics status report format. it’s important to note, the brigade tracks the higher level requirements as well as the brigade commander’s requirements. 8-47. the data requested and subsequently analyzed should be linked to ccir and priority information requirements. some possible details to include in a logistics report are gallons of fuel on hand and projected usage, class i and water status, changes to anticipated expenditure rates, class v status, and any incident having significant impact on the operational capability of a logistics unit or logistical posture of any tactical unit. capturing the status of weapons systems and cr itical equipment is also necessary. some commanders track special event meals or status of critical low density equipment. reported metric criteria such as percentages or colors must be clearly defined. the bsb may include information such as lis connectivity status, route and transportation node status, and distribution platform capabilities. 8-48. the frequency of a logistics status report varies. normally a status report is completed daily, but during periods of increased intensity the commander may require status updates more frequently. as long as automation is available, logistic status relaye d via near-real time automa tion provides the commander with the most up to date data. some examples of logis tic reports are: daily logistic status reports, logistic spot reports and daily maintenance status reports. 8-49. the logistics status report can be completed manually or using bcs3. although mission command systems make capturing and disseminating data and info rmation easier and faster, the staff’s focus is the integrity and usability of the data by commanders and pl anners. however the logistics report is completed, the same data must be reported using the same measurements. 8-50. the organization’s battle rhythm is critical when considering report cut off times, as of times, and reporting times. automated feeds will offer near real time, but if a unit is consolidating information manually, they will have to determine cut off times and reporting times to synchronize with the rest of the brigade. if logistics updates are part of the brigade co mmanders daily battle rhythm the logistics reporting chapter 8 8-8 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 times should be as current as possible to provide the commander with the best status. it is important to allow enough time to analyze the data in order to provide the commander with a considered recommendation on future courses of action. 8-51. once completed, reports are forwarded from a unit to its higher headquarters and its supporting logistics headquarters. normally logistics status reports flow through s-4 channels. the bsb and its subordinate units report both unit on hand supply and supply point on hand quantities. the bct staff has an interest in both reports, as does the supporting sustainment unit. 8-52. it is important that these two groups of supplies are accounted for separately and reported accurately. unit on hand supplies are those items that are for bsb internal consumption. supply point items are those items that are for distribution to the bct, including the bsb. 8-53. the command relationship of units within the brigade determines who reports to whom. although the unit sop should address how attached or opcon elements within the brigade are to report their logistic status, mission orders must delineate relations hips and reporting requirements. normally logistics reporting parallels logistical support responsibility, but this may change throughout the mission. lack of clarity could result in a unit getting too much or not eno ugh of a critical class of su pply or in unnecessarily tasking valuable distribution assets. 8-54. for example, the fsc is organic to the bsb and could submit its logistics status report to the bsb s4. however, if the fsc is attached to its supported battalion, the attachment orders could state the fsc submits its logistics status report to its supported battalion s-4. the supported battalion s-4 would cross level supplies within the battalion, adjust the battalion lo gistics status report and forward to the brigade s-4. the same logic applies to any attached unit. 8-55. action is required at every level. leaders at all le vels analyze the logistics status report and forecast requirements based on current balances and upcoming mission requirements. once logistics information is gathered, a leader may cross level materiel within the organization. for example, a unit first sergeant would cross level supplies within a company, the battalion s-4 cross levels supplies with the battalion. the battalion s-4 submits a consolidated report to the brigade s-4. 8-56. the bsb s-4 collects reports from its subordinate units. the battalion s-4, with the spo and xo’s concurrence, determines which bsb units receive de signated supplies from the bsb supply po int. that decision is based on mission priority and the battalion commander’s guidance. bsb units are resupplied and the logistics status report is forwarded to the brigade s-4. 8-57. the brigade s-4 receives the logistic s status report from all subordin ate units. the brigade s-4, with the brigade xo’s concurrence, determines which units receive designated supplies and shares that information with the bsb spo. the bsb spo acknowledg es required supply actions per the brigade s-4, synchronizes distribution, updates th e supply point on hand status and forecasts resupply requirements for the brigade. the logistic status report is updated with the bsb supply points adjusted balances and forecasted requirements. the bsb spo forwards the entire report to the brig ade s-4 and provides a courtesy copy to the suppor ting sustainment brigade spo. 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 a-1 appendix a sustainment echelons supporting the bct is a carefully planned and executed process. the bsb must plan for, and synchronize echelon support, which is the method of supporting an organization arrayed within an area of operation . common echelon support at the lowest level of sustainment is execu ted at the company and battalion echelon. a-1. how the bct support organizations, including task organized units, are arrayed in echelons can vary widely based upon mission variables. the current mission, task organization, concept of support, and terrain influence how the support is echeloned. a-2. the method employed to echelon support is a deliberate, collaborative decision based upon thorough mission analysis and the military decision making process. this is conducted by the leadership and staffs at the brigade, battalion, and company levels. it must never be a unilateral decision by a single commander since the entire brigade operation will be impacted by the effectiveness of echeloned support. a-3. there must be a thorough understanding at all leve ls of the capabilities of each support organization. commanders of all brigade organizations must understand that echeloned support will vary for the brigade and may even vary by each battalion for a single operation. the bsb is organized to facilitate echeloned support. the fscs are a key element in echeloned support. company echelon a-4. echeloning of support begins at the maneuver company level. the maneuver companies within the bct have no organic logistics organizations. echeloning of support within a company, if required, must be accomplished by task organizi ng personnel and equipment used to facilitate or expedite logistics support within the company. a-5. the composition of the company echelon of suppor t, often referred to as company trains, is determined by the company commander and may consist of the company first serg eant, supply sergeant, and company medical assets. maintenance teams from the fsc may be included. a-6. the company echelon expedites repl enishment of company elements using either the supply point distribution or the unit distribution method. the method used must be described in the mission orders. depending on the distribution method used the first sergeant may send company personnel and vehicles to a supply point designated by the fsc (supply point distribution) or the first sergeant may coordinate for supplies to be delivered to a company or platoon location (unit distribution) by the fsc. a-7. within the company, the first sergeant will replenish company elements using various methods depending on the situation. company elements may move from their positions to the designated site to be fed, to resupply, to turn in damaged equipment. this is often referred to as service station technique. it is normally used in assembly areas and when contact is not likely. it takes the least amount of time for the sustainers. a-8. conversely, the first sergeant may use company pe rsonnel and vehicles to go to each element to replenish them. soldiers can remain in position when using this method. it is the most lengthy resupply method and may compromise friendly pos itions. this is often referred to as tailgate technique or in-position resupply. battalion echelon a-9. each maneuver battalion in the bct is supported by an fsc. battalions in the support brigades also have supporting fscs. the fsc forms the battalion echelon of support, often referred to as battalion trains. appendix a a-2 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 the maneuver battalion commander and staff, the bsb commander and staff, and the fsc commander must collaborate to determine the best method of employment commensurate with the brigade concept of support. a-10. fsc employment considerations include:  fsc location in relation to the supported battalion.  decision to separate elements of the fsc by platoon or other sub-elements into multiple locations.  benefits of locating fsc elements in the brigade support area.  benefits of collocating battalion staff sections with the fsc.  benefits of collocating battalion medical elements with the fsc.  security of the fsc locations.  establishment and location of a maintenance collection point (mcp). a-11. if the battalion commander determines the need to establish a combat trains command post consideration should be given to the organization best suited to assume these tasks under the current situation. the fsc headquarters or someone from the battalion hhc may be tasked with combat trains command post responsibilities. the senior soldier from the fsc is responsible to lead fsc soldiers and ensure the fsc mission is accomplished. sustainment elements must organize and prepare to defend themselves against ground or air attacks. although they often occupy areas that maneuver elem ents of the bct have secured, there is still a requirement to protect against the threat of enemy activity. the senior leader within the fsc is responsible for the security of fsc soldiers and activities at every location. the senior leader must nest the fsc local defense plan within the overall defensive plan if located within another unit's perimeter. forward logistics element a-12. a forward logistics element (fle) is comprised of task-organiz ed multifunctional logistics assets designed to support fast-moving offensive operations in the early phases of decisive action. the fle operates out of a forward logistics base or support area. the fle represents the bsb commander’s ability to weight the effort for the operation by drawing on all sustainment assets across the brigade. additionally, the bsb commander may coordinate with echelons above brigade to provide support capabilities to augment the fle in the concept of support. this incl udes identifying and the positioning of echelons above brigade unit assets in prox imity to geographically di spersed forces to extend operational reach and prolong endurance. the intent for employing a fle is to minimize tactical pauses to the offensive plan and enable momentum for the commander. 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 b-1 appendix b brigade support area the bsa is a designated area in which sustainment elements locate to provide support to a brigade. it is an area recommended by the bsb commander, and established by the brigade commander as the b est location in which to support the brigade. b-1. the bsa is the sustainment hub of the suppor ted brigade. the brigade commander approves the location of the bsa based upon recommendations from the bsb commander and brigade staff. the bsb commander’s goal is to retain overall freedom of action for fighting military operations. all elements within the bsb, especia lly company commanders and first sergeants must ensure that they consider security in all of their operations. b-2. the bsa should be located so that it best supports bct operations and does not interfere with the tactical movement of bct units, or with units that must pass through the bct area. usually the bsa is on an msr and ideally is out of the range of the enemy’s medium artillery. b-3. there is a constant balancing of support and security. the bsb commander is simultaneously supporting the bct which is conducting offensive, defensive, and stability tasks while ensuring bsa security. all these activities must be integrated so that the timing multiplies their effectiveness throughout the bct area of operations and doesn’t degrade the br igades’ combat effectiveness. the commander must ensure logistics missions and associated activities continue without restriction and that all logistics units can perform protection operati ons against a level 1 threat. b-4. in addition to its relationship to the brigade, the bsb has terrain management and security responsibilities. unless otherwise stated by opord, it has operational control over units located within the bsa and responsibility for the security of the bsa. exact responsibilities will be determined by opord or fragmentary order from the brigade s-3 who has overall staff responsibility for the security of the brigade. bsa layout b-5. normally, the bsa includes the bsb hhc and subord inate companies including all or part of the fscs. in addition to the bsb, the bsa could also include elements from the bct staff, the brigade alternate cp, brigade engineer battalion units, sign al assets, and sustainment units from higher headquarters. depending on factors of mett-tc, there could also be el ements from the u. s. materiel command present in the bsa such as the brigade logistics support team or a contingency contracting team. b-6. the composition of bsa elements will not remain static. the brigade commander could place attached elements in the bsa. additional medical elements, decontamination elements or even a joint element may surge for a particular mission and subsequently depart. the advantages and disadvantages of these placements must be considered with the u ltimate decision on placement made by the brigade commander. b-7. if the bsa changes location, some elements ma y not relocate to the new bsa or the bsa may include additional elements. whenever possible, units should occupy the same location within the bsa relative to the other units every time the bsa moves, or units can use several st andard configurations for ease of transition. b-8. the bsb commander must be able to track and contro l changes. to accomplish this, all ground units entering the brigade area must send a representativ e to report to the bsb cp. they will coordinate movement routes, positioning for units locating in the bsa, communications, support requirements and procedures, and security responsibilities. guards at access control points going in to the bsa will direct representatives of entering units to the cp. also, unit commanders will notify the cp of all support package arrivals and departures. movement of displaced civilians and local civilians must also be controlled. appendix b b-2 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 b-9. locations of elements within the bsa will vary depending on mission variables. the bsb commander and s-3 must use their best judgment in positioning units. if the bsa is too large or the terrain is limited, bsb subordinate companies could be extern al to the bsa perimeter. troop safety guidelines also influence unit placement. the athp is often ou tside the bsa due to size and explosive distance factors. b-10. in addition to staff elements and units, there are supply points associated with the bsa. the distribution company has an ssa, a fuel point and an athp. the field maintenance company sets up maintenance areas and the bsmc es tablishes treatment facilities. if the sustainment brigade provides transportation or water support they will al so need space for a water poi nt and truck parking. b-11. some points to consider-  if all or part of the fscs locate in the bsa, it’s best to position them so they are closer to their supported battalions and near an msr with convenient access to the bsb supply points.  make supply points accessible to both customers and resupply vehicles and helicopters. keep class iii points away from other supplies to prevent contamination. they should also be located at least 100 feet from water sources.  locate the medical treatment areas away from likely target areas (athp, class iii point, bridges, and road junctions) but near evacuation routes and an open area for landing air ambulances.  position the athp near, but off the msr, so that echelon above brigade trailers bringing ammunition into the area do not clog up the ms r or the bsa. the athp requires sufficient area to perform transload operations w ithout interfering w ith bsa traffic.  position cps near the center of the bsa perimete r for mission command and security reasons.  position units with heaviest firepower, such as the maintenance company, along the most threatening avenues of approach. bsa protection b-12. the bsb commander’s responsibility for protectio n includes bsa defense planning, perimeter defense, and extends to convoys and other logistics ac tions occurring outside of the bsa. commanders and staffs must plan for and coordinate protection for subordinate units and detachments located away from the headquarters. tactical sustainment or ganizations are normally the units l east capable of self-defense against an enemy force. they are also ofte n the targets of enemy action. as th e threat increases, unit commanders cannot decrease sustainment operations in favor of enhancing protection. the supported commander and the sustainment unit commander must have previously discussed what risks are reasonable to accept and what risk mitigation measures they should implement based on requirements and priorities, including force health protection. adrp 3-37, protection , offers relevant information about the supporting tasks of protection, protection planning, and protection execution. b-13. logisticians and unit commanders must be competent in warfighting, military decision-making, maneuver, and other tactical skills to anticipate and decide on appropriate risk mitigation measures. while the bsb s-3 is overall responsible for developing the bsa security plan, the bsb s-2 assists by developing the information collection plan to support security operations in and around the bsa. the bsb commander uses intelligence to determine the most probable direction of enemy attack and then concentrates forces to cover that approach. patrolling outside the perimete r and interviewing newcomers to the bsa are some ways to collect information which can then be analyzed for intelligence value. b-14. all elements in, or transiting the area, assist w ith forming and defending the perimeter. based on mission and terrain analyses, the bsb s-3 subdivides th e area and assigns subordinate and tenant units to those subdivided areas. bsa security follows the impera tives of all security. when a particular supply point is sufficiently large, it will be assigned its own area for defense and a security force will be attached to provide protection. commanders and staffs must plan for and coordinate protection for subordinate units and detachments located away from the headquarters. b-15. the perimeter shape conforms to the terrain features that best use friendly observation and fields of fire. the commander can increase the effectiveness of th e perimeter by tying it into a natural obstacle, such as a river, which allows him/her to concentrate comb at power in more threatened areas or operations. brigade support area 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 b-3 b-16. bsb commanders position forces and plan fire and movement so they can respond to the widest possible range of enemy actions. the bsb staff prepares plans, including countera ttack plans, which should be rehearsed, evaluated, and revised as needed. the commander coordinates direct and indirect fire plans. normally, the quick response force cent rally locates to react to a penetration of the perimeter at any point. b-17. the bsb’s tactical sop covers as many defense pr ocedures as possible. the shape and size of the defensive perimeter depends on mission variables, m eaning the perimeter does not necessarily coincide with the boundaries of the ar ea assigned to the bsb. in anticipation of the need for quick reaction force or tactical combat forces, the s-3 develops and rehearses procedures to hand-off the battle to arriving quick reaction force, military police response forces, and tactical combat forces. b-18. the bsb s-3 assigns a perimeter area to each unit in the bsa. the s-3 ensures each unit’s area of fire mutually supports the adjacent unit’s area, when feasible. the s- 3 coordinates with unit commanders and confirms that units in the bsa have coordinated th eir boundaries of fire with their adjacent units. the s-3 section must synchronize direct and indirect fires, obstacles, patrols, observation posts, and sensors to mitigate levels i, ii, and iii threats use of avenues of approach and infiltration lanes. the defensive plan shows unit protection responsibilities, locations of mi nes and obstacles, planned indirect fire coverage, observation posts, listening posts, patrol routes, and positions of automatic and anti-armor weapons. b-19. personnel available for defense actions may be limited within certain units. unit commanders must keep the bsb s-3 informed of their situations. this is particularly true for the bmsc and elements of the fscs that are in the bsa. the fscs are focused forw ard on their supported battalion and may not always be available for bsa security. this is another area th at requires the bsb commander and s-3 to review the risks associated with each course of action. b-20. the commander may consider using weapon systems that are in the shop for repair if qualified operators are available. if the firing system is operable, these weapons should be included in the bsa defensive scheme, and mechanics should work on them in their fighting positions. since night vision devices are not always available, illumination plans must also be included in the overall bsa security plan. b-21. the bsa defense plan must be integrated into the pl an for the entire brigade ar ea of operation. this requires that the bsb staff coordinate with the brig ade s-3 for the overall plan. this coordination should include the brigade engineer coordinator to ensure integration of engineer support and class iv materiel to harden positions and reduce the effectiveness of enemy weapon systems. b-22. the bsb staff must also coordinate directly with staffs of units in areas adjacent to or close to the bsb to plan mutually supporting fires and to prevent firing upon each other. this entire defensive perimeter planning effort must be replicated for protection of logistics elements that operate or move outside of the bsb’s specifically assigned area. this page intentionally left blank . 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 c-1 appendix c legacy stryker brigade support battalion the sbct is an early entry force, designed for rapid deployment and to conduct small scale contingencies. the stryker brigade combat team is ideally suited for early entry operations where support infrastructure is limited or absent but where a relatively powerful, lethal, and flexible comb at force is required. the sbct consists of three stryker infantry battalions; a r econnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition squadron; a field artillery battali on; a brigade engineer battalion, and a brigade support battalion. the legacy sbct bsb does not have forward support companies. this appendix is intended to address support organiza tions and operations that are unique to the legacy sbct bsb. c-1. the stryker brigade combat team is designed to allow increased capabilities through scalability. figure c-1 shows how the stryker brigade combat team is organized. figure c-1. stryker brigade combat team c-2. the sbct bsb contains a headquarters and headqua rters company, a distri bution company, a field maintenance company and a medical company. it does not contain fscs, so it task-organizes to provide support to each maneuver unit in the sbct. the field maintenance company contains five combat repair teams that are designed to support each of the maneuver and fire battalions in the sbct. the headquarters company contains six field feeding teams designed to support each battalion, including the bsb. the bsb in a stryker brigade will further tailor logistics assets to support separate companies. figure c-2 on page c2 depicts a stryker brigade combat team support battalion. c-3. the stryker bsb may use temporary task-organized logistic support teams allocated to maneuver units. logistic support teams are mett-tc dependant and used to support the commander’s intent, to reduce the amount of supplies and equipment in the bsa, and to provide maneuver units with logistics assets to support battalion-level operations. as a rule, logistic support teams are allocated to maneuver units to perform supply distribution, transportation, and food service to support that unit. if one unit has priority for support over another based on mett-tc factors and the sbct commander’s intent, it may be necessary to mix, combine, or shift assets from the bs b, logistic support team, or combat repair team to another to support mission requirement. the preferred solution is to provide surge maintenance capability from within the assets of the bsb, but in some cases that may not be the most efficient or effective way to support the task force. appendix c c-2 atp 4-90 2 april 2014 figure c-2. brigade support battalion within sbct c-4. the sbct field maintenance company has three plat oons: a maintenance control platoon, a wheeled vehicle maintenance (often referred to as the automotive platoon) and a maintenance support platoon. the sbct also has combat repair teams. refer to unit authorization documents for exact type and quantities of assigned equipment. exact configurations of companies vary from command to command depending on mett-tc. for example, some units consolidate the ma intenance control section, shop officer, and the service and recovery section in the company headqu arters. see figure c-3 fo r an example of a field maintenance company. figure c-3. field maintenance company (sbct) c-5. the field maintenance company commander mission commands all personnel assigned or attached to the company. one of the company commander’s chief responsibilities is to execute the bsb commanders’ maintenance plan in support of the spo concept of support. the company commander manages task organization and employment of all maintenance assets to include stryker combat repair team missions and legacy stryker brigade support battalion 2 april 2014 atp 4-90 c-3 recovery assets. he executes the mission according to the spo’s concept of support and any additional orders. the commander is normally located in the bsa but will always be where he can best command soldiers and execute the mission. the commande r provides information and advice concerning maintenance operations throughout the bsa to the bs b commander, support opera tions staff, the brigade engineer battalion and the brigade headquarters. c-6. the field maintenance company provides dedicated field maintenance on an area basis to the bsb units as well as limited support to the fscs, combat repair teams and supported maneuver battalions. the field maintenance company also re tains maintenance capabilities in the bsa since certain pieces of test equipment are not easily transportable. the field maintenance company provides field maintenance on weapons, power generation and other equipment assigned to the bct headquarters, the brigade engineer battalion, the bsb and, on an area basis, for units op erating in the bsa. the field maintenance company provides field maintenance to the brigade’s miss ile and electronic equipment/weapon systems for those battalions that don’t have the capability. c-7. the sbct field maintenance company has a wheeled vehicle repair platoon that provides the capabilities for automotive repair of wheeled vehicles. the wheeled vehicle repair platoon provides field maintenance for the organic wheeled vehicles in the s bct and all supported units within the bsa. it is managed by the maintenance control section. the wheeled vehicle repair platoon also provides limited maintenance to the forward combat repair teams. the wheeled vehicle repair platoon performs troubleshooting, minor (nonstructural) welding, major and secondary component replacement, wheel assembly, and line replaceable unit replacement as part of its replace forward concept. c-8. the sbct field maintenance company has five comb at repair teams that are dispatched to the forward locations of the infantry battalions, reconnai ssance, surveillance, and target acquisition squadron, and fires battalion to conduct field maintenance. the combat repair teams are controlled by the maintenance control officer who coordinates with the supported battalion s-4 and xo to establish work priorities, control movements, and integrate combat repair team operations into the supported battalion oplans. shop stock is permitted for each combat repair team but the combat repair team may not stock more than they can carry in its organic vehicles. in the sbct, the combat repair teams will carry a minimal class ix load. due to its limited size, the combat repa ir team will often require a daily resupply of mission critical repair parts. maintenance teams are dispatched as far forward as possible in order to reduce the requirement to ev acuate equipment. this page
