  "raw_text": "Donald Alexander Mackenzie\n1\nDonald Alexander Mackenzie\nDonald Alexander Mackenzie (1873 – 2 March 1936) was a Scottish journalist and folklorist and prolific writer on\nreligion, mythology and anthropology in the early 20th century.\nLife & Career\nHe was born in Cromarty and began his career in Glasgow. Between 1903 and 1910 he owned and edited The North\nStar in Dingwall, and then moved to the People's Journal in Dundee. From 1916 he represented the Glasgow paper,\nThe Bulletin, in Edinburgh. As well as writing books, articles and poems, he often gave lectures, and also broadcast\ntalks on Celtic mythology. He was the friend of many specialist authorities in his areas of interest. His older brother\nwas William Mackay Mackenzie, Secretary of the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments of\nScotland between 1913 and 1935. He died in Edinburgh on 2 March 1936 and was buried in Cromarty.\nTheories\nNeolithic Matriarchy\nIn one of his key works Myths of Crete and Pre-Hellenic Europe (1917) Mackenzie argued that across Europe during\nNeolithic times, pre-Indo-European societies were matriarchal and woman-centered (gynocentric), where goddesses\nwere venerated but that the Bronze Age Indo-European patriarchal (\"androcratic\") culture supplanted it. Mackenzie's\nmatristic theories were notably influential to Marija Gimbutas.[1] He also believed that the Neolithic matriarchy was\nas far north as Scotland, writing an article in the Celtic Review called \"A Highland Goddess\" attempting to trace the\nvery early presence of goddess worship.[2]\nBuddhist Diffusionism\nMackenzie was a diffusionist.[3] He believed specifically that Buddhists colonised the globe in ancient antiquity and\nwere responsible for spreading the swastika. In his Buddhism in Pre-Christian Britain (1928) he developed the\ntheory that Buddhists were in Britain and Scandinavia long before the spread of Christianity. His main evidence can\nbe summarised as follows:[4]\n•The Gundestrup bowl \"on which the Celtic god, Cernunnos, is postured like a typical Buddha\".\n••Gaulish coins with seated figures like Buddha.\n•The testimony of Asoka who launched Buddhist activities into Europe.\n•Origen's statement of Buddhist doctrines in ancient Britain.\nThe work received a mixed reception. Professor of Philosophy Vergilius Ferm reviewed the work positively, but\nother scholars criticised it for its lack of evidence.[5][6]\nRacial Origin of British\nIn 1922 Mackenzie published Ancient Man in Britain, a work covering the history of Britain from Upper Paleolithic \ntimes, from a strong ethnological basis. The foreword of the book was written by Grafton Elliot Smith. The work \ncovers the earliest settlement of Britain by the first modern Humans from around 35,000 years ago during the \nAurignacian (pp. 19–27). In the book, Mackenzie maintains that the Caucasoid Cro-Magnons who settled in Britain \nwere dark haired and dark eyed, racially akin to the French Basques, Iberians and Berbers of North Africa (p. 25) \nwho he theorised were one of the earliest representatives of the Mediterranean race. This indigenous \nproto-Mediterranean racial stock was later invaded by another \"variety of the Mediterranean race\" who initiated the \nSolutrean culture around 20,000 years ago (p. 50). According to Mackenzie, the Aurignacian and Solutrean peoples \nof Britain traded in shells with Cro-Magnon's of France. They later intermingled with later arriving Caucasoid racial\n\nDonald Alexander Mackenzie\n2\ntypes, including the proto-Alpines (Furfooz race) who were brachycelphalic (broad-skulled) and a Lappid race, who\nhad minor Eskimo phenotypic traits. Mackenzie also believed that there was a highly depigmentated racial type in\nsmall numbers in Britain during the Magdalenian, perhaps who were also blonde, who intermingled with the \"dark\nIberians\" (p. 60). During the Neolithic, Mackenzie believed that the predominant racial type of Britain continued to\nbe Mediterranoid: \"The carriers of Neolithic culture were in the main Iberians of Mediterranean racial type\" (p. 126)\nwho traded in pearls and ores. Regarding Bronze Age Britain, Mackenzie devoted several chapters supporting his\ntheory that traders and \"prospectors\" (miners) arrived in Britain c. 2500 BC, originally from the Eastern\nMediterranean (pp. 98–101). This theory was initially developed by Harold Peake, who coined the term \"Prospector\nTheory\". In the scientific literature of Carleton S. Coon (1939) the theory was revived, and the Mediterraneans who\ncolonised Britain during the late Neolithic or Bronze Age were associated with the Medway megaliths (or\nlong-barrow Megalithic culture). Joseph Deniker earlier called these colonists \"Atlanto-Mediterranean\". Mackenzie\nbelieved that these Mediterranean's who colonised parts of Britain survived well into later historic periods (p. 118)\nand that the Mediterranean race in general was the bulk racial stock of Britain from Paleolithic through to the\nNeolithic and to more recent periods. They had black or brown hair, and swarthy skin \"like those of the Southern\nItalians\" (p. 126) and have survived in numerous pockets of Britain to the modern day (p. 139) despite the fact of the\nlater Anglo-Saxon and Norse settlement, who were fairer in appearance, Mackenzie believed their genetic input or\nadmixture was very limited but that they subjugated the British imposing a new civilization and culture (p. 227).\nPublished Works\n•Elves and Heroes (1909)\n•Finn and his warrior band;: Or, Tales of old Alban (1911)\n•The khalifate of the West (1911)\n•Teutonic Myth and Legend (1912, 2nd Ed. 1934)\n•Egyptian Myth and Legend (1913)\n•Myths of Babylonia and Assyria (1915); online editions: gutenberg.org [7], sacred-texts.com [8], wisdomlib.org [9]\n•Indian Fairy Stories (1915)\n•Brave deeds of the War (1915)\n•Heroes and Heroic Deeds of the Great War (1915)\n•Great deeds of the Great war (1916)\n•Stories of Russian Folk-Life (1916)\n•Lord Kitchener, the story of his life and work (1916)\n•From all the Fronts (1917)\n•Wonder tales from Scottish Myth and Legend (1917)\n•Myths of Crete and Pre-Hellenic Europe (1917)\n•Indian Myth and Legend (1919)\n•Sons & daughters of the Motherland (1919)\n•The Story of the Great War (1920)\n•Sons & daughters of Canada (1920)\n•Ancient Man in Britain (1922)\n•Myths of Pre-Columbian America (1924)\n•Tales from the Northern Sagas (1926)\n•The Gods of the Classics (1926)\n•The Story of Ancient Crete (80 page booklet, 1927)\n•The Story of Ancient Egypt (80 page booklet, 1927)\n•The Story of Ancient Babylonia and Assyria (80 page booklet, 1927)\n•Buddhism in Pre-Christian Britain (1928)\n•Myths of China and Japan (1924, 2nd Ed. 1930)\n\nDonald Alexander Mackenzie\n3\n•Ancient England (phamplet, 1931)\n•Myths and Traditions of the South Sea Islands (1931)\n•Migration of Symbols (1926)\n•Footprints Of Early Man (1927)\n•Ancient civilizations from the earliest times to the birth of Christ (1927)\n•Burmese Wonder Tales (1929)\n•Scotland: the ancient kingdom (1930)\n•Some Makers of History (1930)\n•Myths from Melanesia and Indonesia (1930, 2nd Ed. 1933)\n•Scottish folk-lore and folk life (1935)\n•Songs of the Highlands and the islands (1936)\nBiography\n•The Scotsman, 3 March 1936\nReferences\n[1][1]\"The gods and goddesses of Old Europe: 7000 to 3500 BC myths, legends and cult images\" , University of California Press, 1974, p. 262.\n[2][2]A Highland Goddess, Donald A.
