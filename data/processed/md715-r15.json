This report addresses all the required elements of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s (EEOC) MD-715 for building and sustaining a Model EEO Program.\n\nVA is comprised of a Central Office (VACO), which is located in Washington, DC, and field facilities throughout the Nation, as well as the U.S. territories and the Philippines.  Programs are administered by three major line organizations:  Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA).  VA is the second largest Federal Department, with a workforce of approximately 362,000 employees.  VA employs 118,600 Veterans, which is approximately 32.7 percent of the workforce.\n\nVA provides health care, benefits, and memorial services for approximately 21.7 million Veterans.  VA provides these services through three major organizational subcomponents:  the VHA, with 152 medical centers, 997 outpatient clinics (including hospital-based, independent, mobile, and community-based outpatient clinics), 136 community living centers, 113 domiciliary rehabilitation treatment programs, and 300 readjustment counseling centers; VBA, with 56 regional offices; and the NCA, with 133 cemeteries.  In addition to the national cemeteries, NCA supports VA’s Cemetery Grant Program which is designed to complement NCA’s national cemeteries across the country.  VACO is the national headquarters office comprising numerous Staff Offices reporting to the Secretary. \n\nUnlike most Federal agencies, VA maintains a tri-partite structure for the administration of its Department-wide EEO and diversity management functions.  The respective functions and responsibilities are distributed among three independent offices as described below:\n\nThe Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) develops Department-wide EEO and diversity policies; performs workforce analyses and reporting; develops outreach and retention programs, and provides training and communication on EEO and diversity topics.\nThe Office of Resolution Management (ORM) administers the Department’s EEO complaint processing system (counseling, procedural decisions, investigation, and compliance), oversees the Workplace Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Program, and provides oversight for the VA’s Anti-Harassment Office to ensure allegations of workplace harassment are handled in a fair and effective manner. \nThe Office of Employment Discrimination Complaint Adjudication (OEDCA) issues final agency decisions (FAD) based upon an investigative record or final orders following a decision by an EEOC administrative judge. \n\t\nIn FY 2014, Secretary Robert McDonald provided his vision for VA; to transform VA from its current way of doing business to one that places the Veterans in control of how, when and where they wished to be served.  This transformational process is referred as MyVA and will serve as a catalyst to modernize VA’s processes, culture and capabilities to put the needs of the Veterans and their families first.  As identified in the MyVA Integrated Plan, dated July 30, 2015 “, the MyVA vision is to provide a seamless, unified Veteran experience across the entire organization and throughout the country.”\n\nOfficials and specialists responsible for managing and accounting for all VA’s EEO program have embraced the vision and are currently working to enable the EEO programs to incorporate the MyVA goals and strategies while still ensuring compliance with all EEO regulations.  \n\nLimitations on Applicant flow data \n\nPlease note that the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) new USA Staffing information system is sufficient to populate EEOC’s table A-7 and B-7 tables.  However, it does not contain the necessary data to populate EEOC’s A9, B9, A11 and B11 tables.  Hence table A11 and B11 will not include applicant information. \n\nFor the current USA Staffing system, a three month time lag exists with the publishing of OPM’s audited applicant data.  Hence the applicant data published in tables A-7 and B-7 of this report will reflect the period of time covering October 1, 2014, through July 31, 2015 only.  The remaining workforce tables are for the period ending September 30, 2015.   \n\n\nSummary of Self-Assessment against the Model EEO Program Essential Elements\n\nIn FY 2015, VA continued to make progress toward implementing a Model EEO Program in accordance with EEOC’s six essential elements identified in Part G, which contains a list of yes/no type questions grouped under each of the elements.  A “no” response indicates a deficiency in that aspect of the EEO program.  ODI monitors VA’s status on these elements through a sophisticated web-based system that enables VA components to enter and track their self-assessments on the MD-715 Parts G and H at all organizational levels.  Deficiencies identified at the national level focused mainly on structural challenges, such as inconsistent coordination between EEO and Human Resources (HR) staff and lack of centralized tracking and enforcement in some areas.  These issues have been addressed in Part H.  Table 1 displays the percent of the “Compliance Indicators” assessed as met in Part G of the report and is grouped by each Model EEO program essential element.  Generally, “Compliance Indicators” in Part G were assessed as being met completely in four of the six essential elements.  As indicated at Table 1, there has been some measured improvement in the management and program accountability element and the efficiency element.  The paragraphs following Table 1 depict some of VA’s major accomplishments and challenges under each of the six essential elements.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.  Percent of Compliance Indicators met by EEOC Essential Element\n\n\n\nDEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT BY AGENCY LEADERSHIP:  Robert A. McDonald was nominated by President Obama to serve as the eighth Secretary of Veterans Affairs and was confirmed by the United State Senate on July 29, 2014.  As the new Secretary of VA, he has demonstrated his strong commitment to EEO and diversity in the workforce through several initiatives.  VA strengthened the language of its EEO, Diversity and Inclusion, the Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act (No FEAR), and Whistleblower Rights and Protection Policy Statements.  On April 20, 2015, Secretary McDonald signed the policy statement and reaffirmed VA’s commitment to the rights and protections enshrined in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act, the Whistleblower Protection Act, and related Federal laws that protect our employees.  For FY 2015, the hiring of individuals with targeted disabilities (IWTD) were 3.05 percent of total hires.  The representation of IWTDs was 2.16 percent, exceeding the Secretary’s two percent onboard goal and three percent hiring goal for IWTDs, respectively.  The Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and Administration (ASHRA) and the Deputy Assistant Secretary (DAS) for Diversity and Inclusion continue to co-chair the VA Diversity Council, comprising of senior executives, employee unions, and affinity groups.  Additionally, the Diversity Council supported the Secretary’s Annual Diversity and Inclusion Excellence Awards Program.  VA ODI led an interagency work group that created the framework for the new Diversity in Government Council (DIG). The DIG Council was launched in May 2015.  The council consists of senior level representation from all Cabinet-level departments and provides a forum for improving senior leadership collaboration on operational and strategic diversity and inclusion issues.\n \nORM recognizes exemplary effort on the part of employees, managers, ADR neutrals, the Office of General Counsel, senior executives, ADR programs, and ADR committees/councils/forums in managing conflict and resolving workplace disputes and EEO complaints.  In March 2015, the Fourth Annual Secretary’s ADR Excellence Awards ceremony was held recognizing individuals and programs in all of the aforementioned categories.\n\nThe Under Secretary for Health (USH), David J. Shulkin, M.D., is strongly committed to EEO and diversity in the workforce, and uses multiple approaches to demonstrate his commitment to an expanded EEO program.  The USH and VHA leadership embrace and promote EEO and diversity in the VHA workforce through fostering an environment of open, responsive, and proactive communication and holding Senior Executives accountable for their efforts related to EEO and diversity through their performance measures, and by implementing other policies to strengthen the message of the importance of EEO, diversity and inclusion.  VHA conducted EEO competency training for EEO Managers (both full-time and collateral duty) and additional collateral-duty and EEO staff (i.e., Special Emphasis Program Managers, EEO Specialists and EEO Assistants) who implemented EEO policy and program guidance at all VA Medical Centers (VAMCs).  The USH ensured that sufficient staffing and resources were available to operate the EEO program, as well as the VHA Office of Diversity and Inclusion in an effective manner.\n \nVBA Equal Employment Office (VBA/EEO) updated VBA’s policies to reflect changes in laws and VA’s EEO Policy Statement, VA’s Prevention and Elimination of Harassment in the Workplace Policy, VA’s Prevention of Sexual Harassment Policy Statement, and ADR Policy. VBA/EEO ensures EEO as a mandatory performance standard for all Senior Executive Service (SES) level managers.\n\nRonald E. Walters was named the VA’s Interim Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs (USMA), effective June 23, 2014. The Interim UMSA has supported continued efforts to improve the overall workforce environment though a number of initiatives.  During FY 2015, as part of MyVA Initiative, the Interim USMA focused on opening the lines of communication with NCA employees to foster an environment of transparency and employee engagement.  As part of that effort, the Interim USMA created a central email where NCA employees could communicate directly with him and his staff.  He also produced brief videos to share special events and happenings that are occurring at the Central Office and in the Field; the first video was disseminated to the workforce in September 2015.  For FY-2015, NCA was 99 percent compliant with the annual training and reinforcement of ICARE Integrity, Commitment, Advocacy, Respect, and Excellence (ICARE) values.   \n\nThrough awareness and training programs NCA continues to educate supervisors and managers about the barriers to employment and the hiring challenges that individuals with targeted disabilities face.  An example is the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) webinar, which was presented in June 2015.  \n\nAdditional accomplishments addressing agency leadership commitment are provided at Part H and I of this report.\n\nINTEGRATION OF EEO INTO THE AGENCY’S STRATEGIC MISSION:  During FY 2015, ODI continued to lead the implementation of VA’s Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan for FY 2012 – 2016 that served as a Government-wide model.  Progress on the strategic objectives was reported to the Secretary, senior leadership, and will be disseminated publicly in VA’s sixth Diversity and Inclusion Annual Performance Report for FY 2015.  The Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and Administration (ASHRA), as the designated EEO Director, meets regularly with the Secretary and Deputy Secretary on EEO and diversity issues.  Furthermore, the DAS for Diversity and Inclusion participates in the Monthly Performance Review process, the ASHRA’s senior staff meetings, the Integrated Human Resources Management Board, quarterly HR statistics reviews, and leadership development oversight boards to ensure integration of EEO and diversity policies in Departmental operations.  ODI is a key participatory member on the Workforce Planning (WFP) Council ensuring that VA’s Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan is embodied in all WFP initiatives.      \n\nDuring FY 2015 and in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), established in FY 2014, VA partnered with the African American Federal Executive Association (AAFEA), and the Asian American Government Executives Network (AAGEN) to announce VA’s Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program (SES-CDP) and host a training workshop at VA’s Central Office that consisted of presentations on Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs) and Life as a SES employee.\n\nFY 2015 was a record breaking year in the number of candidates who applied to the Corporate Employee Development Board (CEDB) to attend Federal leadership development programs.  The CEDB’s objective is to identify and nominate the best qualified employees from across VA to attend prescribed high-impact training and professional development programs/opportunities. The CEDB aims to develop a broad cadre of leaders who can help drive change, inform, shape strategic planning, and integrate policy at VA.  \n\nODI assisted the Office of General Counsel (OGC) with the development of OGC’s first Diversity and Inclusion Strategic plan.  The plan incorporates recommendations from the VA’s OGC Leadership Development Program Diverse and Inclusive Group and supports the strategic goals identified in the 2008 VA Office of General Counsel Strategic Plan and 2012 Addendum and the VA Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan for FY 2012 - 2016. \n\nThe budget for the VA National Diversity Intern Program (NDIP) decreased in FY 2015.  The NDIP, administered by ODI, sponsored 135 talented student interns (down from 200 interns in the previous year) from diverse institutions of postsecondary education in a variety of professional fields.  The NDIP is a program that facilitates the hiring of a diverse group of students to the VA workforce.  \n\nDuring 2015, VA hosted many training events with facilities focusing on learning how to explore opportunities, find a right career path, and sharing the MyCareer@VA tool with others in their network.  The presentations offered practical advice to help VA employees strengthen their professional development and highlighting via MyCareer@VA, VA Learning University (VALU)’s premiere career development resource.   \n\nVHA incorporated EEO principles into its Workforce and Succession Strategic Plan, Operational Plan, and VA’s Diversity and Inclusion FY 2012 – 2016 Strategic Plan.  VHA ODI supported and implemented various components of the VA Diversity and Inclusion Plan. The VHA ODI developed the first VHA ODI Strategic Plan 2014-1019, which reflects goals that complement and support EEO principles.  VHA ODI staff supported the EEO Training Institute by conducting classes on Unconscious Bias, Micro-Inequities, Working with Difficult People, Managing Change and Diversity Dimensions.  The Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Employment office (EEO/AEO) provided guidance to Senior Executives within VHA Central Office, the Veteran Integrated Service Network (VISN), and VAMCs.  The EEO/AEO met monthly with VISN Lead EEO Managers and quarterly with all VHA EEO Managers.  VHA EEO Managers had direct contact with senior leadership through various venues, including virtual via Adobe Connect/Live meetings, staff meetings, and emails. Senior leadership supported the achievement of the goals and objectives of the VHA EEO program.  VHA widely disseminated EEO policies through VHA’s expansive communication vehicles, which included the VHA EEO/AEO Web site and SharePoint, emails, conference calls, MS-Live training teleconferences, and quarterly communications with Senior Executives throughout the Administration.\n\nVBA/EEO provides monthly EEO training for supervisors and managers enrolled in VBA leadership programs.  VBA coordinated with ODI to provide 16 face-to-face sessions of Diversity and Inclusion and Cultural Competency Training at the Philadelphia Regional Office (RO) and Insurance Center.  The South Dakota RO received Cultural Competency and Prevention of Bullying in the Workplace Training.  \n\nIn August 2015, the NCA EEO team presented the Interim USMA and his key managers the NCA State of the Agency on the accomplishments and challenges the administration faced in FY 2015. NCA had a total of 12 graduates that completed the year-long Cemetery Director Intern Program. Interns were placed in GS-7 through GS-11 positions as cemetery directors or assistant directors.  The demographics of the interns were diverse and 91.67 percent were Veterans; 50 percent were 30 percent or more disabled.  NCA continues to utilize hiring authorities such as Schedule A, the non-competitive Veterans hiring authority for Veterans with 30 percent disability, the Veterans’ Recruitment Appointment to hire qualified candidates.  In FY 2015, 16 caretakers graduated from NCA’s Apprenticeship Program. NCA’s selected one Asian male in the SES position. \n\nDuring FY 2015 the Office of Information Technology (OI&T) Diversity Management Advisory Council (DMAC) Chairperson collaborated with the National and VA Federal Asian Pacific American Council (FAPAC).  Through their collaboration, OI&T will co-host events and disseminate information to increase visibility and participation in the Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders programs.  OI&T established a VA Workgroup through the DMAC to monitor and assess the implementation of the White House Asian American Pacific Islander (WHAAPI) FY 2014 and FY 2015 Plan.  \n\nAdditional accomplishments addressing integration of EEO into the Agency’s strategic plan are provided at Part H and I of this report.\n\nMANAGEMENT AND PROGRAM ACCOUNTABILITY:  ODI conducted quarterly MD-715 progress review meetings with all Administrations, OI&T, VACO and developed standard monthly diversity reports for distribution to VACO Staff Offices and the Administrations.  ODI performed six on site EEO Technical Assistance Reviews (TAR) at selected field facilities.  The purpose was to analyze hires, separations, promotions, EEO complaints, and employee survey results systematically to identify potential EEO barriers and share best practices.  ODI continued to report EEO workforce statistics to the senior leadership through monthly and quarterly workforce diversity reports and briefings.  ODI prepared and submitted the Department’s EEO status and plans to EEOC in accordance with MD-715 and produced and published the VA Diversity and Inclusion FY 2014 report documenting the accomplishments and outcomes of meeting the VA Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan.  \n\nAdditionally, ODI conducted six national outreach events in collaboration with its affinity group partners to build a diverse and inclusive workforce in VA. .  \n\nODI continued to provide monthly training on reasonable accommodations (RA) and Schedule A hiring.  ODI also provided centralized funding for RAs, which OPM has recognized as a best practice for the retention of IWTDs.  VA participated in the Workforce Recruitment Program (WRP), which connects Federal employers with college students and recent graduates with disabilities.  Overall, VA hired 19 students during the FY 2015 WRP cycle, and there were seven (7) conversions for which WRP students will have an opportunity to become career federal employees.  Of special note, out of all federal agencies participating in WRP, VA ranks number two with regard to WRP conversions.  These strategies contributed a marginal increase in VA's employment of IWTDs (permanent and temporary) from 2.10 percent in FY 2014 to 2.16 percent in FY 2015.  The employment of these strategies was instrumental in helping VA make strides in meeting the Secretary's 3 percent hiring goal for IWTD.  \n\nVHA continues to rate Senior Executives against appropriate performance metrics consisting of six elements addressing a model EEO program.  These performance measures, coupled with the VHA EEO/AEO Quarterly Survey and EEO Program Status Report, allowed Senior Executives to identify systemic barriers to the Model EEO Program and create corrective action plans throughout the year. To help ensure program accountability VHA-wide, EEO/AEO participated in two program assessments.   In addition, a total of 20 VISNs conducted a Peer Review during FY 2015.  VHA Peer Review Reports are being summarized by EEO/AEO to identify the top five trends in VHA EEO Programs for monitoring and reporting on program results.  VHA dedicated staff to coordinate the Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program (FEORP), Selective Placement Program, and Disabled Veterans Affirmative Action Program.  VHA successfully placed ten interns under the Workforce Recruitment Program into field facilities to gain work experience.  Four of five EEO Technical Career Field (TCF) graduates from the 2013 Class were successfully placed into EEO Specialist positions within VHA during FY 2015.  The 2014 Program has five (5) trainees who have completed the first year of the program and continue to receive specific training as described in their individual development plan.  The 2015 Program hired ten trainees, who began their training in July 2015. EEO/AEO has approved ten positions for the 2016 Program.  VHA has steadily increased its representation of disabled Veterans through its Veterans Employment Coordination Service (VECS), which serves as a model for the President’s Executive Order on Veteran Employment Outreach.  The EEO/AEO conducted quarterly surveys through its Dashboard system.  The EEO/AEO survey encompassed the six elements of a comprehensive EEO program as described by the EEOC’s MD– 715 policy.  The data was included in Senior Executives’ performance plans.\n\nVBA’s Oakland RO established policy that supervisors and managers complete VA’s on-line Talent Management System (TMS) Diversity and Conflict Management Training and was 100 percent compliant by September 30, 2015.  In FY 2015 and in accordance with EEOC provisions and VA's Strategic Plan FY 2012-2016, ODI conducted internal audits, i.e. TARs at two VBA facilities: the Records Management Center and Seattle RO.\n\nNCA senior leaders continue to be evaluated on their efforts to ensure equality of opportunity for all employees.  These metrics are completed annually in conjunction with SES performance evaluations. Since these metrics were implemented, diversity metrics have continued to improve significantly in disability and targeted disability representation.  \n\nDuring FY 2014, the NCA EEO Office worked with NCA’s Business Process Improvement and Compliance Service to develop an internal audit process to re view the Title VII and Rehabilitation Act programs.  In FY 2015, the internal audit process was finalized and will be utilized in FY 2016 to evaluate the programs.  During FY 2015, NCA’s EEO office continued to hold conference calls with OGC, Human Resources (HR), Labor Relations and Employee Relations (LR/ER), local Reasonable Accommodations Coordinator (LRAC), managers, supervisors, and employee representatives providing guidance to ensure the agency provided the best legal course of action.  NCA addressed over 45 requests for reasonable accommodations.\n\nOI&T’s DMAC identified the lack of clarity on the Employee Exit Survey.  It has been decided by the DMAC and other staff offices that improvement to the Employee Exit Survey is warranted and the policy, VA Directive 5004 – Employee Entrance and Exit Survey, be revised. \n\nAdditional accomplishments addressing management and program accountability are provided at Part H and I of this report.\n\n\nPROACTIVE PREVENTION OF UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION:   In FY 2015, ODI delivered 205 elective, virtual or face-to-face, learning events at VA facilities nationwide to over 8,134 VA employees addressing the following topics: bullying; generations; processing reasonable accommodation requests; VHA Support Service Center training; barrier analysis; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT); the inclusion paradigm; diversity and inclusion for new employees and new supervisors, and cultural competency.  ODI also issued the inaugural VA Guidance on Religious Expression and Exercise in VA Facilities and Property under VA’s control.  ODI, VALU collaboration enabled VA to earn Honorable Mention at the 2014 MarCom Awards - an international creative competition for individuals and  companies involved in the concept, writing and design of print, visual, audio and web materials and programs.  VA continues to excel with its mandatory bi-annual training programs: Prevention of Workplace Harassment/No FEAR training (workforce is 96 percent compliant), EEO, Diversity, and Conflict Management Training for Managers and Supervisors (supervisor and manager workforce is 93 percent compliant); Whistleblower Rights and Protection and Prohibited Personnel Practices Training (supervisor and manager workforce is 98 percent compliant).   As a result of these training programs and the other proactive prevention strategies described below, VA’s informal EEO Resolution Rate remained steady at 53 percent from FY 2014 to FY 2015.  \nVA has developed the background, overview, scope, and design details for the development of a new Web-based course on implicit bias and implicit association.  The production task is contingent on funding availability for VALU’s contracting process for FY 2016.  VA ODI has proposed and obtained approval of a concept using the World Café model to initiate a race-relations dialog at the VBA Records Management Center in St. Louis, MO which will be preceded by a pilot test in VACO on December 8, 2015.\n\nVA published 12 issues of the Diversity and Inclusion newsletter, six editions of NewsLink and six editions of Diversity News videos for FY 2015.\n\nAt the request of Jersey City the Mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey, the Honorable Steven Fulop,   Dr. John Fuller, VA’s Chief Diversity Educator, provide the city's first inaugural LGBT awareness training for city employees.  Dr. Fuller presented two LGBT Awareness sessions at City Hall Auditorium for all employees, managers, and supervisors on April 16, 2015.  Dr. Fuller received congratulatory recognition from both Mayor Fulop and VA Secretary Robert McDonald for his valuable community outreach effort for LGBT inclusion.\nAfter consultation with EEOC, VA created the framework for a new Anti-Harassment Program and Program Office (AHO), which stood up in ORM in December 2014.  During FY 2015, AHO established an office containing a program manager, two AHO specialists, and one program specialist.  The office created the initial draft policy and handbook detailing procedures and guidance for managers and supervisors to address, proactively, allegations of harassment in the workplace. \nIn June 2015, ORM awarded a contract to conduct Conflict Management and Mediation training.  Over the course of twelve months, twenty-two 3-day training sessions will be delivered to promote skills and competency in managing conflict and resolving workplace disputes and EEO complaints.  The sessions are designed to provide VA senior executives, supervisors, union officials, and employees with communication, negotiation, and problem solving capabilities to effectively address and prevent from escalating the day to day conflicts that arise in the workplace.  In addition to the 3-day sessions, four 1-day sessions will be delivered with labor and management together in one setting.  In FY2015, five 3-day sessions were completed and 107 employees trained, and two 1-day sessions were completed with 88 labor and management officials trained 98% of the individuals attending the training rated it as highly effective.\nIn addition to the Conflict Management and Mediation training, ORM trained 590 employees in ADR Awareness, Basic Mediation Skills, and Communication Skills.  ORM provided quarterly briefings to new employees and supervisors in VA Central Office on ADR and EEO.  ORM trained VHA EEO Program Managers on the role of ORM, their responsibilities as EEO program managers, and settlement compliance monitoring.\nORM conducted 10 Conflict Assessments in FY 2015, to explore workplace conflict, and to provide a picture of the organization that helped leadership respond more effectively to workplace issues.  These assessments were offered as another tool to determine areas in which proactive measures may resolve disputes at the earliest opportunity, the Assessments provided leadership with in-depth, confidential feedback regarding employee concerns, root cause analysis of problem areas, and customized suggestions for resolutions.\n\nIn FY 2015, ORM also conducted 296 hours of training for 393 individuals related to 33 findings of discrimination.  \nORM continues to provide tools and resources to senior executives, managers and supervisors, and employees on the EEO complaint and ADR process.  In FY 2015, ORM re-issued several publications and educational materials, such as VA’s EEO poster and brochure.  ORM updated this information to reflect coverage for allegations of discrimination based on sexual orientation under Title VII and the basis of sex.  ORM also updated and re-issued a training DVD on the Root Causes of Workplace Disputes as well as its Executive Leaders Guide on EEO complaints and ADR.  \nVHA took measures to prevent unlawful discrimination through a variety of events, actions, and activities to promote EEO and the acceptance of diversity.  During FY 2015, EEO/AEO personnel provided training to managers and supervisors upon request.  EEO/AEO also provided training to three VHA Central Office program offices.  Monthly training sessions were held for EEO Managers. The EEO/AEO personnel conducted a total of 31 training sessions in FY 2015 for EEO professionals and other stakeholders (i.e., workforce planners, Human Resources Management Staff, Education Coordinators, etc.).  EEO/AEO dispersed quarterly reports on ADR metrics and targeted disabilities which included enhancement tips in order to keep the VISN and medical center Directors abreast of their progress towards meeting FY 2015 goals.\nVBA maintains a RA program that processes requests and accommodations within the required time-frames.  RA training is regularly provided to ensure LRACS are informed of new laws, updated agency policies and EEOC provisions.  In FY 2015, RA training was provided by General Counsel via video for supervisors and managers and LRACs.  Additionally, General Counsel conducted RA training at the VBA's Director's Conference in June 2015.  The filing of EEO complaints based on disability has decreased from 98 in FY 2014 to 69 in FY 2015, and the failure to accommodate claim decreased from 53 in FY 2014 to 34 in FY 2015.\nDuring FY 2015, the NCA EEO office met with the Director of the new Anti-Harassment Office.  NCA will develop a cadre of individuals that have experience and the skill set to conduct investigations when harassment allegations arise.  Further, NCA’s leadership participated in the mandatory EEO, Diversity & Inclusion, and Conflict Management training with a 97.12 percent completion rate.  This course reinforced knowledge and skills acquired throughout the year, enabling managers to address challenging issues and improve the workplace climate.  Management also participated in other EEO related training and pre-mediation discussions which are paramount to addressing and resolving both EEO and Non-EEO concerns.\nAdditional accomplishments addressing proactive prevention of unlawful discrimination are provided at Part H and I of this report.\n\nEFFICIENCY:  ORM tracks EEO complaint processing for each stage of the EEO complaint process from the initial, informal contact through closure.  ORM continued to process counseling sessions below the requisite 30 days (24 days in FY 2015) and completed the informal complaint process when ADR was elected on an average of 66 days, well below the EEOC requirement of 90 calendar days.  Un-amended investigations in FY 2015 were processed on an average of 177 days, below the 180-day requirement for investigation processing time. \n\nIn FY 2015, OEDCA decision output increased 9.5 percent and case inventory was reduced 47 percent.  At the end of FY 2015, 37 percent (no change from FY 2014) of OEDCA’s pending cases were older than 60 days.\n\nORM’s ADR program has had an extremely positive impact on the efficiency of VA’s EEO program nationwide, with ADR being offered in 99 percent of all informal EEO complaints.  The ADR election rate of informal EEO complaints in which both VA and the aggrieved person agree to participate in ADR was 59 percent.  ADR is used for both EEO and non-EEO disputes with very positive results:\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.  ADR in EEO Process\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.  ADR Outcomes\n\n           \n\n\nVA estimates that without early intervention, approximately 50 percent of the non-EEO disputes could become EEO complaints.  \n\nORM provides all VA administrations access to the EEO, Diversity, and ADR Dashboard.  This Dashboard is used to monitor and identify the status of EEO complaints, the complaint resolution process, and other information/data necessary to analyze complaint activity and historical trends.  \n\nIn FY 2015, VBA experienced 144 EEO complaints, which is a decrease from 171 EEO complaints in FY 2014.  VBA maintains an effective Alternative Dispute Program.  In FY 2015, the offer rate was 100 percent exceeding the 80 percent goal.  For VBA, the participation rate was 55 percent exceeding the goal of 53 percent participation in ADR for informal complaints.  For VBA, the resolution rate was 51 percent exceeding the goal of 50 percent. VBA's total cost avoidance is estimated at $450 million.\n\nIn FY 2015, NCA experienced a filing of 42 informal complaints and 92 percent (39) of the mediations of these complaints were completed below the requisite timeframe.  NCA’s ADR program is vital to the overall workforce.  In addressing workforce concerns from workplace disputes to EEO complaints, NCA developed ADR training to focus not only on the benefits of mediation but providing the tools to both management and employees to address conflict as early as possible.  This training addresses communication, trust, respect and the importance of a diverse and inclusive work environment.  This fiscal year NCA’s ADR participation rate is 64.29 percent, up from 51.85 percent the previous fiscal year.  NCA recognizes that complaint activity has increased for FY 2015; however, NCA is working diligently to reduce the number of complaints filed by 15 percent for FY 2016.  To accomplish this goal, NCA has partnered with the Federal Mediation Conciliation Services (FMCS) to provide an in-depth ADR training across at all national cemeteries.  For FY 2016, 13 cemeteries were identified to receive this training.  Additionally, NCA’s EEO office received several requests from cemetery directors to conduct various training and climate assessments to address issues to improve the work environment.  These requests show that managers and supervisors are engaging in proactive measures to improve their overall workforce environment.  These assessments are planned to be conducted in FY 2016.\n\nAdditional accomplishments addressing efficiency are provided at Part H and I of this report.\n\n\nRESPONSIVENESS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE:  ODI, ORM, OEDCA, and the Office of Human Resources Management (OHRM), and the Administrations share responsibility for responsiveness and legal compliance in the area of EEO.  In FY2015, ORM conducted a comprehensive review of the revised EEOC Management Directive 110 (MD-110) and engaged ORM National Advisors for Counseling, Procedural Determinations, and Investigations to update policy, procedure, and training materials to comply with the new guidance.  Information and resources were communicated to and shared with all ORM employees.  In addition, ORM participated in a pilot with EEOC to transition from EFX to FedSep.  VA was one of the first federal agencies to use FedSep to transmit hearing and appeal files to EEOC and monitor and update status of hearings and appeals in real time.  In FY2015, ORM continued to monitor compliance with findings of discrimination and report compliance to EEOC.  ORM played a lead role in conducting training ordered in these cases and in reviewing decisions on whether or not to take disciplinary action against a responsible management official.  In FY2014, the Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and Administration, VA’s EEO Director, issued guidance on the documentation required by VA administrations and staff offices when discipline was to be considered in an effort to ensure greater accountability of management officials when discrimination was found.  As a result, the number of cases where discipline was taken has increased, ensuring discrimination does not recur.\n\nORM also revised its settlement agreement templates to better account for the Defense Finance and Accounting Service’s (DFAS) role in certain actions such as back pay and restoration of leave and secured OGC’s agreement to conduct legal sufficiency reviews of all settlements involving EEO complaints prior to execution of the agreement.  These steps are intended to ensure compliance and prevent breach allegations.\n\nFinally, ORM implemented Interagency Agreements with other federal agencies to process conflict of interest cases.  These steps ensure VA’s compliance with MD-110 and provide for neutral and impartial processing of complaints involving ORM employees and individuals in the EEO Director’s chain of command.\n\nVHA has an active ADR program with a 99.41 percent offer rate for EEO cases.  Mediation may be utilized for all workplace disputes, not just EEO complaints.  For FY 2015 the ADR program alone provided VHA an estimated cost avoidance of more than $54 million.  In FY 2015, five of the seven ADR three-day training sessions were held.  Three sessions targeted audiences who were “All Grades/Full-time employees, two sessions targeted audiences who were GS-12 and below and Title 38 equivalents.  ORM reported 107 senior managers (i.e., GS-12 and below, GS-13 – 15 and SES) attended conflict management and ADR training to enhance their conflict management and resolution skills.  In FY 2015, two remaining sessions were one-day events and there were 88 employees that participated.  OEDCA, ORM, OHR, VISNs, and facilities all shared responsibility for the responsiveness and legal compliance in the area of EEO.   VHA has been a vigorous proponent of MD-715 since it was published and continues to improve and lead the government in the area of workforce analysis for EEO reporting purposes.  ODI developed the first government software for producing the tables and analytic tools, and made the software available for free to other agencies.   \n\nIn FY 2015, VBA had three findings of discrimination.  Two findings were based on disability and one finding based reprisal. The requirements stipulated in the final orders for these cases were completed.\n\nFurther accomplishments of these essential elements are addressed in the Part H accomplishments section.\n\nAdditional accomplishments addressing responsiveness and legal compliance are provided at Part H and I of this report.\n\nWorkforce Composition\n\nAs the second largest Cabinet-level executive department, VA is proud to be one of the most diverse agencies in the Federal Government.  The Relevant Civilian Labor Force (RCLF) is the benchmark against which we measure the diversity of our workforce.  Compared to the RCLF, VA’s workforce is at or above the RCLF representation in all areas except for White and Hispanic females, and Hispanic and Asian males.  While the overall representation of most demographic groups increased in FY 2015, the proportional representation of Hispanic females increased marginally from 3.53 percent to 3.62 percent.  The proportional representation of White females decreased from 35.17 percent to 34.86 percent.  The proportional representation of Hispanic males increased from 3.15 percent to 3.16 percent.  The proportional representation of Asian males increased from 2.81 percent to 2.86 percent.  \n   \nFigure 1 depicts VA’s current on-board representation as compared with the CLF and RCLF.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.  VA Onboard versus RCLF/CLF \n(Permanent and Temporary)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLF includes all occupations and RCLF is limited to VA occupations in VA proportions.  The Civilian Labor Force (CLF) consists of all U.S. citizens 16 years of age and over, excluding those in the Armed Forces, who are employed or unemployed and seeking employment in all U.S. occupations.  The CLF does not include Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories.  The Relevant Civilian Labor Force (RCLF) consists of all U.S. citizens 16 years of age and over, excluding those in the Armed Forces, who are employed in or unemployed and seeking employment in VA specific occupations.  When the organization has a presence in Puerto Rico, the population of Puerto Rico is included. \n\n.\n\nWe look at net change in order to determine whether the groups with low participation rates are increasing at the same rate or higher than the change for the total VA workforce.  The net change for the total VA workforce in FY 2015 was a 4.29 percent increase, or 14,892 employees.  At the end of FY 2015, VA’s workforce totaled 361,946 employees, including 19,409 temporary employees.  For the second year in a row since EEOC’s MD 715 was enacted, the growth rate for all minority groups, excluding White women, exceeded the total workforce average growth rate.  This is a “good” news story.  ODI believes this is a testament to the success of improving the workforce diversity by focusing on outreach and retention programs to the historically under-represented race, ethnicity, and gender (REG) groups.\n\nThe workforce growth rate for White males and females decreased.  White females had a lower than expected representation rate (compared with the RCLF) and experienced a growth rate of 3.38 percent.  White males experienced a growth rate of 2.96 percent and still exceeded its expected representation.  VA will continue to place special emphasis on outreach and retention efforts for Hispanic males and females, White females, and Asian males given that they fall below their expected representation.  Table 4 provides detail of the net changes of the total workforce by Race, Ethnicity, and Gender (REG).  The net change for each REG is compared to the net change for the total number of employees.  Net changes below the average net change for the entire workforce are highlighted in red.\n\n\nTable 4.  Net Change Analysis \n\n Net change is calculated by dividing the difference between the number of current employees and the number of employees in the prior year by the number of employees in the prior year.  \n\n\nTargeted Disabilities\n\nIn addition to examining the workforce by REG, we also reviewed the data for IWTD.  Continuing with last year’s trend, the representation of IWTD (permanent and temporary) increased from 2.10 percent in FY 2014 to 2.16 percent in FY 2015, the highest among all cabinet level departments.  The net change for this group’s population was a positive 7.12 percent, compared to 4.29 percent for the total VA workforce.  We believe this increase is a testament to the success of VA’s focused efforts as guided by its FY 2012-2016 Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan, and the Secretary’s three percent hiring goal for IWTD.   In addition, VA annually resurveys its workforce, focusing on the disability status of its employees.  The resurvey is executed on a volunteer self-identification basis.  Permanent employees with targeted disabilities increased from 2.08 percent in FY 2014 to 2.17 percent of the VA permanent workforce in FY 2015.  VA will continue to monitor, monthly, the onboard and hiring statistics for IWTD as a performance metric and to determine if VA policy goals for IWTDs should be adjusted to higher goals starting in FY 2017.  Approximately 63 percent of VA’s employees with targeted disabilities are Veterans.\n\nAccording to Figure 2, from FY 2014 to FY 2015 there was an increase of employees with targeted disabilities who self-identified as having a psychiatric disability.  Individuals with psychiatric disabilities grew at a rate of 10.76% and are the largest component (60.05 percent) of IWTD.  The number of employees who identified with a psychiatric disability increased from 4,266 in FY 2014 to 4,725 in FY 2015.  This group also had the highest involuntary separation rate of all EEO groups, compared to their onboard rate.  Many of these employees are disabled Veterans.  The separation rate for permanent employees with targeted disabilities is of particular concern.  Although they represented 2.08 percent of the permanent workforce at the beginning of FY 2015, their voluntary separation rate during the fiscal year was 2.03 percent, and their involuntary separation rate was 5.93 percent.  This high separation rate does impact VA’s efforts to maintain its two percent or higher onboard goal for employees with targeted disabilities. \n\nFigure 2.  Comparison of Targeted Disabilities by Type of Disability. \n\n\n\n\nSecretary McDonald is committed to maintaining the two percent onboard goal for this group.  For FY 2015, Secretary McDonald is also committed to setting the hiring goal at three percent.  Further corrective strategies will focus on:  1) Develop enhanced capabilities in the Reasonable Accommodations Compliance System; 2) Continued training to HR and managers on the use of Schedule A and VA’s RA procedures; and 3) Improving advancement opportunities as part of a retention strategy.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion Indices\n\nThe Diversity Index and Inclusion Index (rebranded by OPM as the Inclusion Quotient) provide leadership with the capability to view quickly how well their diversity and inclusion program is performing versus relying on a series of 28 analytical tables and employment survey results to interpret.  The Diversity Index measures the convergence of an organization’s aggregate workforce representation by race, ethnicity, gender (REG) with the CLF or RCLF, as applicable.  The metric can be expanded to include other dimensions such as education and disability once baselines are established.  The algorithm calculates the aggregate mean of the ratios of an agency’s workforce representation by REG with the corresponding representation in the RCLF or CLF.  The result is a single metric on a scale of 0 to 100 percent, reflecting an organization’s overall diversity.  Where appropriate, the algorithm is applied to the RCLF to isolate the qualified relevant labor force.  This method provides a more appropriate, efficient metric to gauge Federal workforce diversity.  An index value of 100 percent means the organization’s diversity aligns perfectly with the RCLF or CLF.  VA’s monthly Diversity Index for FY 2014 is provided at Figure 3.  Note:  This index currently focuses on REG and does not track the disability aspect of diversity.  The monthly Diversity Index is incorporated within the Monthly Performance Review process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.  VA’s FY 2015 Diversity Index\n\n \n\n\n\n\nVA’s Inclusion Index is a measure of organizational inclusion based on employee responses to empirically validated items in the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS).  It is calculated as the ratio of the total favorable responses to the total responses utilizing OPM’s weighted survey results.  In FY 2013, OPM adopted VA’s methodology to measure workforce inclusion for the entire Federal Government and rebranded it as the Inclusion Quotient.  The Inclusion Indices for FY 2015 are provided at Table 5.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.  Inclusion Index (OPM Inclusion Quotient)\n\n\n\nBarrier Analysis\n\nThe EEOC guidance regarding barriers to full participation refers to the indication of a possible barrier as a “trigger.”  VA has identified six primary triggers in its barrier analysis, which are addressed in Part I of this report.  VA is able to track and report on its barrier analyses and the impact of corrective strategies through its Web-based workforce data system, VHA Service Support Center applications (VSSC).  In order to fully integrate VA’s Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan goals with Administration operations, ODI embedded the Department-wide goals into the objectives of the MD-715 Part I Plans.  This was done to ensure that field components assume some accountability for Departmental goals because their EEO offices do not report directly to ODI.  While the goals are Department-wide, subcomponent organizations were encouraged to identify and address their organization-specific triggers in their Part I Plans.  This was communicated through quarterly Microsoft Live Web-based technical assistance meetings with field entities to assist them in the development of their organization-specific EEO Plans.  \n\nThe six triggers identified in the Part I plans are:\n\nLess than expected representation of White females:  Compared with the respective RCLFs, White females (permanent and temporary employees) had less than expected participation in the VA workforce.  White females are 34.86 percent (10.83 percent below the RCLF of 45.69 percent).  This less than expected participation trickles down to Administration level (VHA, VBA, NCA, and VACO).  A more detailed trigger and barrier analysis is provided at Part I of this report. \n\nLess than expected representation of Hispanics:  Compared with the respective RCLF, Hispanic males and females (permanent and temporary employees) had less than expected participation in the VA workforce.  In VA, Hispanic males represent 3.16 percent of the permanent and temporary workforce and Hispanic females represent 3.61 percent, whereas Hispanic males represent 3.84 percent of the RCLF and 5.17 percent of the CLF and Hispanic females represent 5.70 percent and 4.79 percent, respectively.  The net change for Hispanic males (4.83 percent) and females (6.55 percent) is above the net change for the total workforce (4.29 percent), meaning that Hispanic males and females are growing at a rate greater than that of the total workforce.  This less than expected participation trickles down to the Administration level (VHA, VBA, NCA, and VACO).  A more detailed trigger and barrier analysis is provided at Part I of this report.  \n\nLess than expected representation of Asian males:  Compared with the respective RCLF, Asian males (permanent and temporary employees) had less than expected participation in the VA workforce.  In VA, Asian males represent 2.86 percent of the permanent and temporary workforce, whereas Asian males represent 2.95 percent of the RCLF.  However, the net change for Asian males (6.31 percent) is above the net change for the total workforce (4.29 percent), meaning that Asian males are growing at a rate above that of the total workforce.  This less than expected participation trickles down to Administration level (VHA, VBA, NCA, and VACO).  A more detailed trigger and barrier analysis is provided at Part I of this report.\n\nDisparate promotion rates:  Black females experienced lower promotion rates (15.83 percent) as compared to the overall promotion rate (16.82 percent) for permanent entry level positions (GS 3-8).  Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander males (NHOPIM) and females (NHOPIF) experienced a low promotion rate at the entry and senior level.  The promotion rates for NHOPIMs were 15.24 percent and 4.65 percent, respectively.  The promotion rates for NHOPIFs at the entry level were 15.32 percent and 0.00 percent at the senior level.  Asian females experienced low promotion rates at the entry level and journeyman level only, 11.83 percent and 20.12 percent, respectively.   A more detailed trigger and barrier analysis is provided at Part I of this report.\n\nHigh volume of discrimination complaints:  The per capita filing rate at the informal stage increased from 1.33 percent to 1.43 percent from FY 2014 to FY 2015, while the formal complaint filing rate increased from 0.61 percent to 0.66.  These rates remain slightly higher than the government-wide rates of 1.1 percent and .5 percent, respectively.  In FY 2015, the number of findings in discrimination increased (29 in FY 2014 and 33 in FY 2015).  Reprisal, race, and disability were the most prevalent bases of discrimination in those findings.  Recommended corrective strategies include increasing early resolution of EEO complaints through counseling and ADR, reviewing findings and incorporating lessons learned into training, and increasing EEO and consultative services.  A more detailed trigger and barrier analysis is provided at Part I of this report.\n\nLess than expected representation in the SES Cadre (permanent workforce):  With the exception of White, Hispanic and the American Indian/Alaska Native males, all the other race/ethnicity and gender groups fall below their expected representation.  The representation of White men (45.38 percent) alone is almost double the expected representation (23.05 percent) and most likely serves as the catalyst for the less than expected representation for the other demographic groups.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6. SES Demographics \n\nSource: VSSC – HR Database; Red font Red indicates where ES participation fell below workforce benchmark; Upward mobility benchmark represents the demographics of the groups focusing on just those occupations (16 occupations) that have the opportunity to advance  from GS/GM grade 1 to the SES levels\n\nWhite and Hispanic males do quite well compared with the three benchmarks.  A more detailed trigger and barrier analysis is provided at Part I of this report.\n\n\n\nSummary of Planned Objectives for FY 2016 \n\nThe following list summarizes the planned initiatives laid out in Part H, I, and J for FY 2016 to eliminate identified barriers or correct program deficiencies.\n\nRefine anti-harassment program: (1) enhance anti-harassment coordinator (AHC) network, (2) expand case management system, and (3) launch training for employees, supervisors, managers, union officials, and AHCs.\nContinue marketing MyCareer@VA to additional facilities focusing on career mapping strategies to facilitate career advancement for all groups. \nContinue to track VA-wide disciplinary actions taken against RMOs in findings of discrimination and report as appropriate in MD 715 Part G. \nContinue implementation of training evaluation instrument and metrics.\nIntegrate the new USA Staffing Applicant Flow System into VA HR information system...  \nUpdate VSSC to track participation in VA leadership development programs by REG in VA’s TMS.\nIncrease the number of Conflict Assessments conducted to provide insight that may improve workplaces and reduce disputes and complaints.\nRevise the management and implementation of ODI’s Web site.\nContinue to streamline the FAD process.\nRevise the Relevant Civilian Labor Force computation to align with EEOC guidance.\nVA ODI staff will continue to implement the National Diversity Internship Program that provides career exploration opportunities for current undergraduate and graduate students from diverse socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds.  \nVA ODI staff will continue to implement the Workforce Recruitment Program, a program used to connect federal and private sector employers nationwide with college students and recent graduates with disabilities who are eager to prove their abilities in the workplace through summer employment or permanent jobs. \nDesign and initiate Special Emphasis Program training for all VBA EEO managers.\nConduct technical and quality review of the refresh projects on mandatory EEO, D&I, Reasonable Accommodation, Conflict Resolution Training, and whistleblower rights and protection; conduct technical and quality review of the refresh project on harassment prevention, NoFEAR, and whistleblower protection for all employees.

Please see Data Definitions for a listing of the Nature of Action codes that are included for Time-Off awards, Cash Awards, and Quality-Step Increase. \n\nAnalysis  \n\nVA’s representation of individuals with targeted disabilities has exceeded the Administration’s goal of 2 percent and is above the government average of 1.07 percent for FY 2014 (the latest data available).  However, this group has a glass ceiling at the GS-10/title 38 equivalent level.  Approximately 8 percent of the total workforce is in wage grade jobs.  About 7.02 percent of the wage grade workforce are IWTDs; whereas, for the white collar positions about 1.74 percent are IWTDs. \n\nIn FY 2015, the percent of VA’s permanent workforce with a targeted disability increased to 2.17 percent, up from 2.08 percent in FY 2014 and 1.92 percent in FY 2013.  The rate of growth, or net change, for the total permanent workforce with targeted disabilities (9.23 percent) was a little less than two times the rate of growth for the entire permanent workforce (4.69 percent), [Reference Table B1].  This high net change was essential to achieving the on board ratio increase.  \n\nPermanent employees with targeted disabilities are not well represented above GS-10/Title 38 equivalent pay levels or at the Senior Executive Level (1.17 percent compared to 1.74 percent for the total workforce).  From FY 2014 to 2015, employees with targeted disabilities experienced a marginal increase in their participation rate at the GS-10 and GS-11/title 38 equivalents.  There was a marginal decrease at the GS-12, GS-13, GS-14 and 15/title 38 equivalents.   \n\nWith the exception of Executive/Senior Level and Mid-Level Officials and Managers (Table B3), employees with targeted disabilities made gains in FY 2015 in all other occupational categories.  They are now 1.12 percent of the Executive/Senior Level (1.29 percent in FY 2014), and 1.14 percent of Mid-Level Officials and Managers (1.27 percent in 2014).   \n\nThe five job series with the largest number of individuals with targeted disabilities are Custodial Workers (1,031), Medical Support Assistant (591), Food Service Worker (497), Miscellaneous Clerk and Assistant (493), and Nurse (346).\n\nAt the end of FY 2015, 26.28 percent of employees with targeted disabilities in permanent positions were in wage grade occupations, up from 24.53 percent in FY 2014.  In comparison, at the end of FY 2015, 6.98 percent of individuals with no disabilities (includes those who did not identify) in permanent positions were in wage grade positions, down from 7.38 percent in FY 2014. \n\nGenerally, the glass ceiling for IWTDs in the wage grade occupations occurs at grade 3.  Approximately, 81 percent of IWTDs in Wage Grades 1 and 2 self-reported having severe intellectual or psychiatric disabilities.   This same group is approximately 79 percent of the number of IWTDs in wage grade positions.  With the exception of one instance, there are no IWTDs at wage grades 14 and 15.\n\nThe top three wage grade occupations for individuals without disabilities (includes those who did not identify) are Custodial Worker (7,200), Food Service Worker (3,460) and Motor Vehicle Operator (1,326).  By legislation, the Custodial job series is reserved for Veterans.  There were 1,031 Custodial Workers with a targeted disability.  \n\nIn FY 2015, IWTDs have a high separation rate (3.34 percent) in the permanent workforce higher than their workforce participation rate (2.16 percent).  Out of those IWTDs who separated from VA, 2.35 percent of them had psychiatric disabilities.  Of the employees with targeted disabilities who were involuntarily separated, 5.93 percent (148) have psychiatric disabilities.  Of VA’s permanent employees with targeted disabilities, 1.30 percent has psychiatric disabilities.  While this group is only 2.16 percent of VA’s workforce, they were 7.49 percent of involuntary separations.\n\nThe number of Selective Placement Coordinators and Local RA Coordinators with the proper skill set remains insufficient throughout the Department.  \n\nThe ratio of complaints based on disability remains high.  The total number of cases filed (29 CFR § 1614.7049[d]) with a basis of disability increased to 766 in FY2015, up from 635 in FY 2014.  \n\n\n\n\nVA has encountered obstacles in installing assistive technology because each facility has a slightly different infrastructure.  \n\n\n\nAccomplishments \n\n\nDuring FY 2015, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) continued its efforts toward resurveying the workforce via Standard Form 256, “Self-Identification of Disability” with the desired expected result as an increase in the representation of IWTD throughout the workforce.\n\nIn FY 2015, ODI trained 184 employees on how to identify less than expected participation rates within their respective facilities and how to apply and utilize the Schedule A hiring authority.  In addition, ODI increased the number of staff allocated to the departmental Disability Employment Program. \n\nDuring FY 2015, ODI conducted Reasonable Accommodation (RA) training on a bi-monthly basis throughout the Administrations and Central Staff Offices whereby approximately 2,600 Local Reasonable Accommodation Coordinators (LRACs), Supervisors, and Employees received training on RA.  The Office of Information and Technology office required all supervisors to attend RA training and as a result, 1,100 personnel were provided this training.  In addition, the Office of General Counsel conducted RA training to all Veterans Health Administration LRACs and other personnel involved in the RA process as well as providing quarterly RA sessions titled “Conversations with the Lawyers”.  \n\nIn direct alignment with the VA’s FY 2012-2016 Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan, there is a centralized resource for reimbursing VA field and staff offices for reasonable accommodation expenditures which helps to ensure timely, effective, compliant accommodations for employees and applicants with disabilities.  The funding significantly reduces potential barriers to equal opportunity regarding hiring, development, and retention for individuals with disabilities within the workforce.  In FY 2015, the total amount of accommodations reimbursed was $274,000.  \n\nOutreach to IWTDs is accomplished using public recruiting sources, including OPM’s Shared List of People with Disabilities; One-Stop Career Centers established under the Workforce Investment Act; State vocational rehabilitation agencies and community rehabilitation programs; State employment agencies; Employment Networks established under the Ticket to Work program; independent living centers established under Title VII of the Rehabilitation Act; and the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Offices.  In addition, the Veterans Employment Service Office (VESO) and ODI have formed a partnership to strengthen and broaden outreach efforts to include all individuals with disabilities, including Veterans. \n\nIn FY 2015, VA participated in the Workforce Recruitment Program (WRP), which connects Federal employers with college students and recent graduates with disabilities.  Overall, VA hired 19 students during the FY 2015 WRP cycle, and there were seven (7) conversions for which WRP students will have an opportunity to become career federal employees.  Of special note, out of all federal agencies participating in WRP, VA ranks number two with regard to WRP conversions.  \n\nVA utilizes many outlets to communicate with the workforce: Diversity@Work Newsletter; Diversity News Video, and Newslink.  Using these various outlets, VA employees are made aware of accomplishments and updates regarding the Disability Employment Program.  In addition, regular e-mail communication is sent to Selective Placement Coordinators (SPCs) and LRACs regarding updates and information on Schedule A and RA.  \n\nDuring FY 2015, ODI made significant efforts to improve the Reasonable Accommodation Compliance System (RACS).  RACS is used as the single source for all RA requests, department-wide.  The improvements included: updating the required form documentation in alignment with the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008; enhancement of the workflow throughout the system to ensure the system is more intuitive; creation of quick links for user functionality; and broadening the reporting functions to allow for real-time snapshots.  These improvements will enable the LRACs greater ease in tracking RA requests and all management and employees to receive automated updates throughout the RA process.  \n\nThe MyCareer@VA initiative was designed to support President Obama’s goal of engaging a higher performing diverse Federal workforce by creating programs aimed to address career progression barriers and bottle necks experienced by individuals of diverse groups and IWTD in Wage Grade (WG) positions and at General Schedule (GS) grades 9 and below.  The 2015 MyCareer@VA Day events directly informed 386 VA employees about the MyCareer@VA program through the employees' participation in at least one of the MyCareer@VA Day activities.  Additionally, 8,149 VA employees learned about MyCareer@VA as a result of information distributed through the facility-wide marketing and communications.\nPlanned Activities\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(This Page Intentionally Left Blank)\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkforce Analytical Tables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(This Page Intentionally Left Blank) \n \nData shown includes full-time, part-time, and intermittent employees in a pay status and excluding medical and Manila residents.\nThe CLF data is based on the 2010 National Census Data and excludes Puerto Rico, and other US territories (i.e., Guam, ...)\nRCLF comparisons are based on 2010 National Census National data.\nFor VHA, the methodology for computing RCLF has changed.

intentionally left blank) introduction the department of veterans affairs (va) is proud to present va’s management directive (md) 715 equal employment opportunity (eeo) program status report for fiscal year (fy) 2015 and eeo plan for fy 2016. this report addresses all the required elements of the equal employment opportunity commission’s (eeoc) md-715 for building and sustaining a model eeo program. va is comprised of a central office (vaco), which is located in washington, dc, and field facilities throughout the nation, as well as the u.s. territories and the philippines. programs are administered by three major line organizations: veterans health administration (vha), veterans benefits administration (vba), and the national cemetery administration (nca). va is the second largest federal department, with a workforce of approximately 362,000 employees. va employs 118,600 veterans, which is approximately 32.7 percent of the workforce. va provides health care, benefits, and memorial services for approximately 21.7 million veterans. va provides these services through three major organizational subcomponents: the vha, with 152 medical centers, 997 outpatient clinics (including hospital-based, independent, mobile, and community-based outpatient clinics), 136 community living centers, 113 domiciliary rehabilitation treatment programs, and 300 readjustment counseling centers; vba, with 56 regional offices; and the nca, with 133 cemeteries. in addition to the national cemeteries, nca supports va’s cemetery grant program which is designed to complement nca’s national cemeteries across the country. vaco is the national headquarters office comprising numerous staff offices reporting to the secretary. unlike most federal agencies, va maintains a tri-partite structure for the administration of its department-wide eeo and diversity management functions. the respective functions and responsibilities are distributed among three independent offices as described below: the office of diversity and inclusion (odi) develops department-wide eeo and diversity policies; performs workforce analyses and reporting; develops outreach and retention programs, and provides training and communication on eeo and diversity topics. the office of resolution management (orm) administers the department’s eeo complaint processing system (counseling, procedural decisions, investigation, and compliance), oversees the workplace alternative dispute resolution (adr) program, and provides oversight for the va’s anti-harassment office to ensure allegations of workplace harassment are handled in a fair and effective manner. the office of employment discrimination complaint adjudication (oedca) issues final agency decisions (fad) based upon an investigative record or final orders following a decision by an eeoc administrative judge. in fy 2014, secretary robert mcdonald provided his vision for va; to transform va from its current way of doing business to one that places the veterans in control of how, when and where they wished to be served. this transformational process is referred as myva and will serve as a catalyst to modernize va’s processes, culture and capabilities to put the needs of the veterans and their families first. as identified in the myva integrated plan, dated july 30, 2015 “, the myva vision is to provide a seamless, unified veteran experience across the entire organization and throughout the country.” officials and specialists responsible for managing and accounting for all va’s eeo program have embraced the vision and are currently working to enable the eeo programs to incorporate the myva goals and strategies while still ensuring compliance with all eeo regulations. limitations on applicant flow data please note that the office of personnel management’s (opm) new usa staffing information system is sufficient to populate eeoc’s table a-7 and b-7 tables. however, it does not contain the necessary data to populate eeoc’s a9, b9, a11 and b11 tables. hence table a11 and b11 will not include applicant information. for the current usa staffing system, a three month time lag exists with the publishing of opm’s audited applicant data. hence the applicant data published in tables a-7 and b-7 of this report will reflect the period of time covering october 1, 2014, through july 31, 2015 only. the remaining workforce tables are for the period ending september 30, 2015. summary of self-assessment against the model eeo program essential elements in fy 2015, va continued to make progress toward implementing a model eeo program in accordance with eeoc’s six essential elements identified in part g, which contains a list of yes/no type questions grouped under each of the elements. a “no” response indicates a deficiency in that aspect of the eeo program. odi monitors va’s status on these elements through a sophisticated web-based system that enables va components to enter and track their self-assessments on the md-715 parts g and h at all organizational levels. deficiencies identified at the national level focused mainly on structural challenges, such as inconsistent coordination between eeo and human resources (hr) staff and lack of centralized tracking and enforcement in some areas. these issues have been addressed in part h. table 1 displays the percent of the “compliance indicators” assessed as met in part g of the report and is grouped by each model eeo program essential element. generally, “compliance indicators” in part g were assessed as being met completely in four of the six essential elements. as indicated at table 1, there has been some measured improvement in the management and program accountability element and the efficiency element. the paragraphs following table 1 depict some of va’s major accomplishments and challenges under each of the six essential elements. table 1. percent of compliance indicators met by eeoc essential element demonstrated commitment by agency leadership: robert a. mcdonald was nominated by president obama to serve as the eighth secretary of veterans affairs and was confirmed by the united state senate on july 29, 2014. as the new secretary of va, he has demonstrated his strong commitment to eeo and diversity in the workforce through several initiatives. va strengthened the language of its eeo, diversity and inclusion, the notification and federal employee antidiscrimination and retaliation act (no fear), and whistleblower rights and protection policy statements. on april 20, 2015, secretary mcdonald signed the policy statement and reaffirmed va’s commitment to the rights and protections enshrined in the civil rights act of 1964, the notification and federal employee antidiscrimination and retaliation act, the whistleblower protection act, and related federal laws that protect our employees. for fy 2015, the hiring of individuals with targeted disabilities (iwtd) were 3.05 percent of total hires. the representation of iwtds was 2.16 percent, exceeding the secretary’s two percent onboard goal and three percent hiring goal for iwtds, respectively. the assistant secretary for human resources and administration (ashra) and the deputy assistant secretary (das) for diversity and inclusion continue to co-chair the va diversity council, comprising of senior executives, employee unions, and affinity groups. additionally, the diversity council supported the secretary’s annual diversity and inclusion excellence awards program. va odi led an interagency work group that created the framework for the new diversity in government council (dig). the dig council was launched in may 2015. the council consists of senior level representation from all cabinet-level departments and provides a forum for improving senior leadership collaboration on operational and strategic diversity and inclusion issues. orm recognizes exemplary effort on the part of employees, managers, adr neutrals, the office of general counsel, senior executives, adr programs, and adr committees/councils/forums in managing conflict and resolving workplace disputes and eeo complaints. in march 2015, the fourth annual secretary’s adr excellence awards ceremony was held recognizing individuals and programs in all of the aforementioned categories. the under secretary for health (ush), david j. shulkin, m.d., is strongly committed to eeo and diversity in the workforce, and uses multiple approaches to demonstrate his commitment to an expanded eeo program. the ush and vha leadership embrace and promote eeo and diversity in the vha workforce through fostering an environment of open, responsive, and proactive communication and holding senior executives accountable for their efforts related to eeo and diversity through their performance measures, and by implementing other policies to strengthen the message of the importance of eeo, diversity and inclusion. vha conducted eeo competency training for eeo managers (both full-time and collateral duty) and additional collateral-duty and eeo staff (i.e., special emphasis program managers, eeo specialists and eeo assistants) who implemented eeo policy and program guidance at all va medical centers (vamcs). the ush ensured that sufficient staffing and resources were available to operate the eeo program, as well as the vha office of diversity and inclusion in an effective manner. vba equal employment office (vba/eeo) updated vba’s policies to reflect changes in laws and va’s eeo policy statement, va’s prevention and elimination of harassment in the workplace policy, va’s prevention of sexual harassment policy statement, and adr policy. vba/eeo ensures eeo as a mandatory performance standard for all senior executive service (ses) level managers. ronald e. walters was named the va’s interim under secretary for memorial affairs (usma), effective june 23, 2014. the interim umsa has supported continued efforts to improve the overall workforce environment though a number of initiatives. during fy 2015, as part of myva initiative, the interim usma focused on opening the lines of communication with nca employees to foster an environment of transparency and employee engagement. as part of that effort, the interim usma created a central email where nca employees could communicate directly with him and his staff. he also produced brief videos to share special events and happenings that are occurring at the central office and in the field; the first video was disseminated to the workforce in september 2015. for fy-2015, nca was 99 percent compliant with the annual training and reinforcement of icare integrity, commitment, advocacy, respect, and excellence (icare) values. through awareness and training programs nca continues to educate supervisors and managers about the barriers to employment and the hiring challenges that individuals with targeted disabilities face. an example is the post traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) webinar, which was presented in june 2015. additional accomplishments addressing agency leadership commitment are provided at part h and i of this report. integration of eeo into the agency’s strategic mission: during fy 2015, odi continued to lead the implementation of va’s diversity and inclusion strategic plan for fy 2012 – 2016 that served as a government-wide model. progress on the strategic objectives was reported to the secretary, senior leadership, and will be disseminated publicly in va’s sixth diversity and inclusion annual performance report for fy 2015. the assistant secretary for human resources and administration (ashra), as the designated eeo director, meets regularly with the secretary and deputy secretary on eeo and diversity issues. furthermore, the das for diversity and inclusion participates in the monthly performance review process, the ashra’s senior staff meetings, the integrated human resources management board, quarterly hr statistics reviews, and leadership development oversight boards to ensure integration of eeo and diversity policies in departmental operations. odi is a key participatory member on the workforce planning (wfp) council ensuring that va’s diversity and inclusion strategic plan is embodied in all wfp initiatives. during fy 2015 and in accordance with the memorandum of understanding (mou), established in fy 2014, va partnered with the african american federal executive association (aafea), and the asian american government executives network (aagen) to announce va’s senior executive service candidate development program (ses-cdp) and host a training workshop at va’s central office that consisted of presentations on executive core qualifications (ecqs) and life as a ses employee. fy 2015 was a record breaking year in the number of candidates who applied to the corporate employee development board (cedb) to attend federal leadership development programs. the cedb’s objective is to identify and nominate the best qualified employees from across va to attend prescribed high-impact training and professional development programs/opportunities. the cedb aims to develop a broad cadre of leaders who can help drive change, inform, shape strategic planning, and integrate policy at va. odi assisted the office of general counsel (ogc) with the development of ogc’s first diversity and inclusion strategic plan. the plan incorporates recommendations from the va’s ogc leadership development program diverse and inclusive group and supports the strategic goals identified in the 2008 va office of general counsel strategic plan and 2012 addendum and the va diversity and inclusion strategic plan for fy 2012 - 2016. the budget for the va national diversity intern program (ndip) decreased in fy 2015. the ndip, administered by odi, sponsored 135 talented student interns (down from 200 interns in the previous year) from diverse institutions of postsecondary education in a variety of professional fields. the ndip is a program that facilitates the hiring of a diverse group of students to the va workforce. during 2015, va hosted many training events with facilities focusing on learning how to explore opportunities, find a right career path, and sharing the mycareer@va tool with others in their network. the presentations offered practical advice to help va employees strengthen their professional development and highlighting via mycareer@va, va learning university (valu)’s premiere career development resource. vha incorporated eeo principles into its workforce and succession strategic plan, operational plan, and va’s diversity and inclusion fy 2012 – 2016 strategic plan. vha odi supported and implemented various components of the va diversity and inclusion plan. the vha odi developed the first vha odi strategic plan 2014-1019, which reflects goals that complement and support eeo principles. vha odi staff supported the eeo training institute by conducting classes on unconscious bias, micro-inequities, working with difficult people, managing change and diversity dimensions. the equal employment opportunity/affirmative employment office (eeo/aeo) provided guidance to senior executives within vha central office, the veteran integrated service network (visn), and vamcs. the eeo/aeo met monthly with visn lead eeo managers and quarterly with all vha eeo managers. vha eeo managers had direct contact with senior leadership through various venues, including virtual via adobe connect/live meetings, staff meetings, and emails. senior leadership supported the achievement of the goals and objectives of the vha eeo program. vha widely disseminated eeo policies through vha’s expansive communication vehicles, which included the vha eeo/aeo web site and sharepoint, emails, conference calls, ms-live training teleconferences, and quarterly communications with senior executives throughout the administration. vba/eeo provides monthly eeo training for supervisors and managers enrolled in vba leadership programs. vba coordinated with odi to provide 16 face-to-face sessions of diversity and inclusion and cultural competency training at the philadelphia regional office (ro) and insurance center. the south dakota ro received cultural competency and prevention of bullying in the workplace training. in august 2015, the nca eeo team presented the interim usma and his key managers the nca state of the agency on the accomplishments and challenges the administration faced in fy 2015. nca had a total of 12 graduates that completed the year-long cemetery director intern program. interns were placed in gs-7 through gs-11 positions as cemetery directors or assistant directors. the demographics of the interns were diverse and 91.67 percent were veterans; 50 percent were 30 percent or more disabled. nca continues to utilize hiring authorities such as schedule a, the non-competitive veterans hiring authority for veterans with 30 percent disability, the veterans’ recruitment appointment to hire qualified candidates. in fy 2015, 16 caretakers graduated from nca’s apprenticeship program. nca’s selected one asian male in the ses position. during fy 2015 the office of information technology (oi&t) diversity management advisory council (dmac) chairperson collaborated with the national and va federal asian pacific american council (fapac). through their collaboration, oi&t will co-host events and disseminate information to increase visibility and participation in the asian americans and pacific islanders programs. oi&t established a va workgroup through the dmac to monitor and assess the implementation of the white house asian american pacific islander (whaapi) fy 2014 and fy 2015 plan. additional accomplishments addressing integration of eeo into the agency’s strategic plan are provided at part h and i of this report. management and program accountability: odi conducted quarterly md-715 progress review meetings with all administrations, oi&t, vaco and developed standard monthly diversity reports for distribution to vaco staff offices and the administrations. odi performed six on site eeo technical assistance reviews (tar) at selected field facilities. the purpose was to analyze hires, separations, promotions, eeo complaints, and employee survey results systematically to identify potential eeo barriers and share best practices. odi continued to report eeo workforce statistics to the senior leadership through monthly and quarterly workforce diversity reports and briefings. odi prepared and submitted the department’s eeo status and plans to eeoc in accordance with md-715 and produced and published the va diversity and inclusion fy 2014 report documenting the accomplishments and outcomes of meeting the va diversity and inclusion strategic plan. additionally, odi conducted six national outreach events in collaboration with its affinity group partners to build a diverse and inclusive workforce in va. . odi continued to provide monthly training on reasonable accommodations (ra) and schedule a hiring. odi also provided centralized funding for ras, which opm has recognized as a best practice for the retention of iwtds. va participated in the workforce recruitment program (wrp), which connects federal employers with college students and recent graduates with disabilities. overall, va hired 19 students during the fy 2015 wrp cycle, and there were seven (7) conversions for which wrp students will have an opportunity to become career federal employees. of special note, out of all federal agencies participating in wrp, va ranks number two with regard to wrp conversions. these strategies contributed a marginal increase in va's employment of iwtds (permanent and temporary) from 2.10 percent in fy 2014 to 2.16 percent in fy 2015. the employment of these strategies was instrumental in helping va make strides in meeting the secretary's 3 percent hiring goal for iwtd. vha continues to rate senior executives against appropriate performance metrics consisting of six elements addressing a model eeo program. these performance measures, coupled with the vha eeo/aeo quarterly survey and eeo program status report, allowed senior executives to identify systemic barriers to the model eeo program and create corrective action plans throughout the year. to help ensure program accountability vha-wide, eeo/aeo participated in two program assessments. in addition, a total of 20 visns conducted a peer review during fy 2015. vha peer review reports are being summarized by eeo/aeo to identify the top five trends in vha eeo programs for monitoring and reporting on program results. vha dedicated staff to coordinate the federal equal opportunity recruitment program (feorp), selective placement program, and disabled veterans affirmative action program. vha successfully placed ten interns under the workforce recruitment program into field facilities to gain work experience. four of five eeo technical career field (tcf) graduates from the 2013 class were successfully placed into eeo specialist positions within vha during fy 2015. the 2014 program has five (5) trainees who have completed the first year of the program and continue to receive specific training as described in their individual development plan. the 2015 program hired ten trainees, who began their training in july 2015. eeo/aeo has approved ten positions for the 2016 program. vha has steadily increased its representation of disabled veterans through its veterans employment coordination service (vecs), which serves as a model for the president’s executive order on veteran employment outreach. the eeo/aeo conducted quarterly surveys through its dashboard system. the eeo/aeo survey encompassed the six elements of a comprehensive eeo program as described by the eeoc’s md– 715 policy. the data was included in senior executives’ performance plans. vba’s oakland ro established policy that supervisors and managers complete va’s on-line talent management system (tms) diversity and conflict management training and was 100 percent compliant by september 30, 2015. in fy 2015 and in accordance with eeoc provisions and va's strategic plan fy 2012-2016, odi conducted internal audits, i.e. tars at two vba facilities: the records management center and seattle ro. nca senior leaders continue to be evaluated on their efforts to ensure equality of opportunity for all employees. these metrics are completed annually in conjunction with ses performance evaluations. since these metrics were implemented, diversity metrics have continued to improve significantly in disability and targeted disability representation. during fy 2014, the nca eeo office worked with nca’s business process improvement and compliance service to develop an internal audit process to re view the title vii and rehabilitation act programs. in fy 2015, the internal audit process was finalized and will be utilized in fy 2016 to evaluate the programs. during fy 2015, nca’s eeo office continued to hold conference calls with ogc, human resources (hr), labor relations and employee relations (lr/er), local reasonable accommodations coordinator (lrac), managers, supervisors, and employee representatives providing guidance to ensure the agency provided the best legal course of action. nca addressed over 45 requests for reasonable accommodations. oi&t’s dmac identified the lack of clarity on the employee exit survey. it has been decided by the dmac and other staff offices that improvement to the employee exit survey is warranted and the policy, va directive 5004 – employee entrance and exit survey, be revised. additional accomplishments addressing management and program accountability are provided at part h and i of this report. proactive prevention of unlawful discrimination: in fy 2015, odi delivered 205 elective, virtual or face-to-face, learning events at va facilities nationwide to over 8,134 va employees addressing the following topics: bullying; generations; processing reasonable accommodation requests; vha support service center training; barrier analysis; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (lgbt); the inclusion paradigm; diversity and inclusion for new employees and new supervisors, and cultural competency. odi also issued the inaugural va guidance on religious expression and exercise in va facilities and property under va’s control. odi, valu collaboration enabled va to earn honorable mention at the 2014 marcom awards - an international creative competition for individuals and companies involved in the concept, writing and design of print, visual, audio and web materials and programs. va continues to excel with its mandatory bi-annual training programs: prevention of workplace harassment/no fear training (workforce is 96 percent compliant), eeo, diversity, and conflict management training for managers and supervisors (supervisor and manager workforce is 93 percent compliant); whistleblower rights and protection and prohibited personnel practices training (supervisor and manager workforce is 98 percent compliant). as a result of these training programs and the other proactive prevention strategies described below, va’s informal eeo resolution rate remained steady at 53 percent from fy 2014 to fy 2015. va has developed the background, overview, scope, and design details for the development of a new web-based course on implicit bias and implicit association. the production task is contingent on funding availability for valu’s contracting process for fy 2016. va odi has proposed and obtained approval of a concept using the world café model to initiate a race-relations dialog at the vba records management center in st. louis, mo which will be preceded by a pilot test in vaco on december 8, 2015. va published 12 issues of the diversity and inclusion newsletter, six editions of newslink and six editions of diversity news videos for fy 2015. at the request of jersey city the mayor of jersey city, new jersey, the honorable steven fulop, dr. john fuller, va’s chief diversity educator, provide the city's first inaugural lgbt awareness training for city employees. dr. fuller presented two lgbt awareness sessions at city hall auditorium for all employees, managers, and supervisors on april 16, 2015. dr. fuller received congratulatory recognition from both mayor fulop and va secretary robert mcdonald for his valuable community outreach effort for lgbt inclusion. after consultation with eeoc, va created the framework for a new anti-harassment program and program office (aho), which stood up in orm in december 2014. during fy 2015, aho established an office containing a program manager, two aho specialists, and one program specialist. the office created the initial draft policy and handbook detailing procedures and guidance for managers and supervisors to address, proactively, allegations of harassment in the workplace. in june 2015, orm awarded a contract to conduct conflict management and mediation training. over the course of twelve months, twenty-two 3-day training sessions will be delivered to promote skills and competency in managing conflict and resolving workplace disputes and eeo complaints. the sessions are designed to provide va senior executives, supervisors, union officials, and employees with communication, negotiation, and problem solving capabilities to effectively address and prevent from escalating the day to day conflicts that arise in the workplace. in addition to the 3-day sessions, four 1-day sessions will be delivered with labor and management together in one setting. in fy2015, five 3-day sessions were completed and 107 employees trained, and two 1-day sessions were completed with 88 labor and management officials trained 98% of the individuals attending the training rated it as highly effective. in addition to the conflict management and mediation training, orm trained 590 employees in adr awareness, basic mediation skills, and communication skills. orm provided quarterly briefings to new employees and supervisors in va central office on adr and eeo. orm trained vha eeo program managers on the role of orm, their responsibilities as eeo program managers, and settlement compliance monitoring. orm conducted 10 conflict assessments in fy 2015, to explore workplace conflict, and to provide a picture of the organization that helped leadership respond more effectively to workplace issues. these assessments were offered as another tool to determine areas in which proactive measures may resolve disputes at the earliest opportunity, the assessments provided leadership with in-depth, confidential feedback regarding employee concerns, root cause analysis of problem areas, and customized suggestions for resolutions. in fy 2015, orm also conducted 296 hours of training for 393 individuals related to 33 findings of discrimination. orm continues to provide tools and resources to senior executives, managers and supervisors, and employees on the eeo complaint and adr process. in fy 2015, orm re-issued several publications and educational materials, such as va’s eeo poster and brochure. orm updated this information to reflect coverage for allegations of discrimination based on sexual orientation under title vii and the basis of sex. orm also updated and re-issued a training dvd on the root causes of workplace disputes as well as its executive leaders guide on eeo complaints and adr. vha took measures to prevent unlawful discrimination through a variety of events, actions, and activities to promote eeo and the acceptance of diversity. during fy 2015, eeo/aeo personnel provided training to managers and supervisors upon request. eeo/aeo also provided training to three vha central office program offices. monthly training sessions were held for eeo managers. the eeo/aeo personnel conducted a total of 31 training sessions in fy 2015 for eeo professionals and other stakeholders (i.e., workforce planners, human resources management staff, education coordinators, etc.). eeo/aeo dispersed quarterly reports on adr metrics and targeted disabilities which included enhancement tips in order to keep the visn and medical center directors abreast of their progress towards meeting fy 2015 goals. vba maintains a ra program that processes requests and accommodations within the required time-frames. ra training is regularly provided to ensure lracs are informed of new laws, updated agency policies and eeoc provisions. in fy 2015, ra training was provided by general counsel via video for supervisors and managers and lracs. additionally, general counsel conducted ra training at the vba's director's conference in june 2015. the filing of eeo complaints based on disability has decreased from 98 in fy 2014 to 69 in fy 2015, and the failure to accommodate claim decreased from 53 in fy 2014 to 34 in fy 2015. during fy 2015, the nca eeo office met with the director of the new anti-harassment office. nca will develop a cadre of individuals that have experience and the skill set to conduct investigations when harassment allegations arise. further, nca’s leadership participated in the mandatory eeo, diversity & inclusion, and conflict management training with a 97.12 percent completion rate. this course reinforced knowledge and skills acquired throughout the year, enabling managers to address challenging issues and improve the workplace climate. management also participated in other eeo related training and pre-mediation discussions which are paramount to addressing and resolving both eeo and non-eeo concerns. additional accomplishments addressing proactive prevention of unlawful discrimination are provided at part h and i of this report. efficiency: orm tracks eeo complaint processing for each stage of the eeo complaint process from the initial, informal contact through closure. orm continued to process counseling sessions below the requisite 30 days (24 days in fy 2015) and completed the informal complaint process when adr was elected on an average of 66 days, well below the eeoc requirement of 90 calendar days. un-amended investigations in fy 2015 were processed on an average of 177 days, below the 180-day requirement for investigation processing time. in fy 2015, oedca decision output increased 9.5 percent and case inventory was reduced 47 percent. at the end of fy 2015, 37 percent (no change from fy 2014) of oedca’s pending cases were older than 60 days. orm’s adr program has had an extremely positive impact on the efficiency of va’s eeo program nationwide, with adr being offered in 99 percent of all informal eeo complaints. the adr election rate of informal eeo complaints in which both va and the aggrieved person agree to participate in adr was 59 percent. adr is used for both eeo and non-eeo disputes with very positive results: table 2. adr in eeo process table 3. adr outcomes va estimates that without early intervention, approximately 50 percent of the non-eeo disputes could become eeo complaints. orm provides all va administrations access to the eeo, diversity, and adr dashboard. this dashboard is used to monitor and identify the status of eeo complaints, the complaint resolution process, and other information/data necessary to analyze complaint activity and historical trends. in fy 2015, vba experienced 144 eeo complaints, which is a decrease from 171 eeo complaints in fy 2014. vba maintains an effective alternative dispute program. in fy 2015, the offer rate was 100 percent exceeding the 80 percent goal. for vba, the participation rate was 55 percent exceeding the goal of 53 percent participation in adr for informal complaints. for vba, the resolution rate was 51 percent exceeding the goal of 50 percent. vba's total cost avoidance is estimated at $450 million. in fy 2015, nca experienced a filing of 42 informal complaints and 92 percent (39) of the mediations of these complaints were completed below the requisite timeframe. nca’s adr program is vital to the overall workforce. in addressing workforce concerns from workplace disputes to eeo complaints, nca developed adr training to focus not only on the benefits of mediation but providing the tools to both management and employees to address conflict as early as possible. this training addresses communication, trust, respect and the importance of a diverse and inclusive work environment. this fiscal year nca’s adr participation rate is 64.29 percent, up from 51.85 percent the previous fiscal year. nca recognizes that complaint activity has increased for fy 2015; however, nca is working diligently to reduce the number of complaints filed by 15 percent for fy 2016. to accomplish this goal, nca has partnered with the federal mediation conciliation services (fmcs) to provide an in-depth adr training across at all national cemeteries. for fy 2016, 13 cemeteries were identified to receive this training. additionally, nca’s eeo office received several requests from cemetery directors to conduct various training and climate assessments to address issues to improve the work environment. these requests show that managers and supervisors are engaging in proactive measures to improve their overall workforce environment. these assessments are planned to be conducted in fy 2016. additional accomplishments addressing efficiency are provided at part h and i of this report. responsiveness and legal compliance: odi, orm, oedca, and the office of human resources management (ohrm), and the administrations share responsibility for responsiveness and legal compliance in the area of eeo. in fy2015, orm conducted a comprehensive review of the revised eeoc management directive 110 (md-110) and engaged orm national advisors for counseling, procedural determinations, and investigations to update policy, procedure, and training materials to comply with the new guidance. information and resources were communicated to and shared with all orm employees. in addition, orm participated in a pilot with eeoc to transition from efx to fedsep. va was one of the first federal agencies to use fedsep to transmit hearing and appeal files to eeoc and monitor and update status of hearings and appeals in real time. in fy2015, orm continued to monitor compliance with findings of discrimination and report compliance to eeoc. orm played a lead role in conducting training ordered in these cases and in reviewing decisions on whether or not to take disciplinary action against a responsible management official. in fy2014, the assistant secretary for human resources and administration, va’s eeo director, issued guidance on the documentation required by va administrations and staff offices when discipline was to be considered in an effort to ensure greater accountability of management officials when discrimination was found. as a result, the number of cases where discipline was taken has increased, ensuring discrimination does not recur. orm also revised its settlement agreement templates to better account for the defense finance and accounting service’s (dfas) role in certain actions such as back pay and restoration of leave and secured ogc’s agreement to conduct legal sufficiency reviews of all settlements involving eeo complaints prior to execution of the agreement. these steps are intended to ensure compliance and prevent breach allegations. finally, orm implemented interagency agreements with other federal agencies to process conflict of interest cases. these steps ensure va’s compliance with md-110 and provide for neutral and impartial processing of complaints involving orm employees and individuals in the eeo director’s chain of command. vha has an active adr program with a 99.41 percent offer rate for eeo cases. mediation may be utilized for all workplace disputes, not just eeo complaints. for fy 2015 the adr program alone provided vha an estimated cost avoidance of more than $54 million. in fy 2015, five of the seven adr three-day training sessions were held. three sessions targeted audiences who were “all grades/full-time employees, two sessions targeted audiences who were gs-12 and below and title 38 equivalents. orm reported 107 senior managers (i.e., gs-12 and below, gs-13 – 15 and ses) attended conflict management and adr training to enhance their conflict management and resolution skills. in fy 2015, two remaining sessions were one-day events and there were 88 employees that participated. oedca, orm, ohr, visns, and facilities all shared responsibility for the responsiveness and legal compliance in the area of eeo. vha has been a vigorous proponent of md-715 since it was published and continues to improve and lead the government in the area of workforce analysis for eeo reporting purposes. odi developed the first government software for producing the tables and analytic tools, and made the software available for free to other agencies. in fy 2015, vba had three findings of discrimination. two findings were based on disability and one finding based reprisal. the requirements stipulated in the final orders for these cases were completed. further accomplishments of these essential elements are addressed in the part h accomplishments section. additional accomplishments addressing responsiveness and legal compliance are provided at part h and i of this report. workforce composition as the second largest cabinet-level executive department, va is proud to be one of the most diverse agencies in the federal government. the relevant civilian labor force (rclf) is the benchmark against which we measure the diversity of our workforce. compared to the rclf, va’s workforce is at or above the rclf representation in all areas except for white and hispanic females, and hispanic and asian males. while the overall representation of most demographic groups increased in fy 2015, the proportional representation of hispanic females increased marginally from 3.53 percent to 3.62 percent. the proportional representation of white females decreased from 35.17 percent to 34.86 percent. the proportional representation of hispanic males increased from 3.15 percent to 3.16 percent. the proportional representation of asian males increased from 2.81 percent to 2.86 percent. figure 1 depicts va’s current on-board representation as compared with the clf and rclf. figure 1. va onboard versus rclf/clf (permanent and temporary) clf includes all occupations and rclf is limited to va occupations in va proportions. the civilian labor force (clf) consists of all u.s. citizens 16 years of age and over, excluding those in the armed forces, who are employed or unemployed and seeking employment in all u.s. occupations. the clf does not include puerto rico or other u.s. territories. the relevant civilian labor force (rclf) consists of all u.s. citizens 16 years of age and over, excluding those in the armed forces, who are employed in or unemployed and seeking employment in va specific occupations. when the organization has a presence in puerto rico, the population of puerto rico is included. . we look at net change in order to determine whether the groups with low participation rates are increasing at the same rate or higher than the change for the total va workforce. the net change for the total va workforce in fy 2015 was a 4.29 percent increase, or 14,892 employees. at the end of fy 2015, va’s workforce totaled 361,946 employees, including 19,409 temporary employees. for the second year in a row since eeoc’s md 715 was enacted, the growth rate for all minority groups, excluding white women, exceeded the total workforce average growth rate. this is a “good” news story. odi believes this is a testament to the success of improving the workforce diversity by focusing on outreach and retention programs to the historically under-represented race, ethnicity, and gender (reg) groups. the workforce growth rate for white males and females decreased. white females had a lower than expected representation rate (compared with the rclf) and experienced a growth rate of 3.38 percent. white males experienced a growth rate of 2.96 percent and still exceeded its expected representation. va will continue to place special emphasis on outreach and retention efforts for hispanic males and females, white females, and asian males given that they fall below their expected representation. table 4 provides detail of the net changes of the total workforce by race, ethnicity, and gender (reg). the net change for each reg is compared to the net change for the total number of employees. net changes below the average net change for the entire workforce are highlighted in red. table 4. net change analysis net change is calculated by dividing the difference between the number of current employees and the number of employees in the prior year by the number of employees in the prior year. targeted disabilities in addition to examining the workforce by reg, we also reviewed the data for iwtd. continuing with last year’s trend, the representation of iwtd (permanent and temporary) increased from 2.10 percent in fy 2014 to 2.16 percent in fy 2015, the highest among all cabinet level departments. the net change for this group’s population was a positive 7.12 percent, compared to 4.29 percent for the total va workforce. we believe this increase is a testament to the success of va’s focused efforts as guided by its fy 2012-2016 diversity and inclusion strategic plan, and the secretary’s three percent hiring goal for iwtd. in addition, va annually resurveys its workforce, focusing on the disability status of its employees. the resurvey is executed on a volunteer self-identification basis. permanent employees with targeted disabilities increased from 2.08 percent in fy 2014 to 2.17 percent of the va permanent workforce in fy 2015. va will continue to monitor, monthly, the onboard and hiring statistics for iwtd as a performance metric and to determine if va policy goals for iwtds should be adjusted to higher goals starting in fy 2017. approximately 63 percent of va’s employees with targeted disabilities are veterans. according to figure 2, from fy 2014 to fy 2015 there was an increase of employees with targeted disabilities who self-identified as having a psychiatric disability. individuals with psychiatric disabilities grew at a rate of 10.76% and are the largest component (60.05 percent) of iwtd. the number of employees who identified with a psychiatric disability increased from 4,266 in fy 2014 to 4,725 in fy 2015. this group also had the highest involuntary separation rate of all eeo groups, compared to their onboard rate. many of these employees are disabled veterans. the separation rate for permanent employees with targeted disabilities is of particular concern. although they represented 2.08 percent of the permanent workforce at the beginning of fy 2015, their voluntary separation rate during the fiscal year was 2.03 percent, and their involuntary separation rate was 5.93 percent. this high separation rate does impact va’s efforts to maintain its two percent or higher onboard goal for employees with targeted disabilities. figure 2. comparison of targeted disabilities by type of disability. secretary mcdonald is committed to maintaining the two percent onboard goal for this group. for fy 2015, secretary mcdonald is also committed to setting the hiring goal at three percent. further corrective strategies will focus on: 1) develop enhanced capabilities in the reasonable accommodations compliance system; 2) continued training to hr and managers on the use of schedule a and va’s ra procedures; and 3) improving advancement opportunities as part of a retention strategy. diversity and inclusion indices the diversity index and inclusion index (rebranded by opm as the inclusion quotient) provide leadership with the capability to view quickly how well their diversity and inclusion program is performing versus relying on a series of 28 analytical tables and employment survey results to interpret. the diversity index measures the convergence of an organization’s aggregate workforce representation by race, ethnicity, gender (reg) with the clf or rclf, as applicable. the metric can be expanded to include other dimensions such as education and disability once baselines are established. the algorithm calculates the aggregate mean of the ratios of an agency’s workforce representation by reg with the corresponding representation in the rclf or clf. the result is a single metric on a scale of 0 to 100 percent, reflecting an organization’s overall diversity. where appropriate, the algorithm is applied to the rclf to isolate the qualified relevant labor force. this method provides a more appropriate, efficient metric to gauge federal workforce diversity. an index value of 100 percent means the organization’s diversity aligns perfectly with the rclf or clf. va’s monthly diversity index for fy 2014 is provided at figure 3. note: this index currently focuses on reg and does not track the disability aspect of diversity. the monthly diversity index is incorporated within the monthly performance review process. figure 3. va’s fy 2015 diversity index va’s inclusion index is a measure of organizational inclusion based on employee responses to empirically validated items in the federal employee viewpoint survey (fevs). it is calculated as the ratio of the total favorable responses to the total responses utilizing opm’s weighted survey results. in fy 2013, opm adopted va’s methodology to measure workforce inclusion for the entire federal government and rebranded it as the inclusion quotient. the inclusion indices for fy 2015 are provided at table 5. table 5. inclusion index (opm inclusion quotient) barrier analysis the eeoc guidance regarding barriers to full participation refers to the indication of a possible barrier as a “trigger.” va has identified six primary triggers in its barrier analysis, which are addressed in part i of this report. va is able to track and report on its barrier analyses and the impact of corrective strategies through its web-based workforce data system, vha service support center applications (vssc). in order to fully integrate va’s diversity and inclusion strategic plan goals with administration operations, odi embedded the department-wide goals into the objectives of the md-715 part i plans. this was done to ensure that field components assume some accountability for departmental goals because their eeo offices do not report directly to odi. while the goals are department-wide, subcomponent organizations were encouraged to identify and address their organization-specific triggers in their part i plans. this was communicated through quarterly microsoft live web-based technical assistance meetings with field entities to assist them in the development of their organization-specific eeo plans. the six triggers identified in the part i plans are: less than expected representation of white females: compared with the respective rclfs, white females (permanent and temporary employees) had less than expected participation in the va workforce. white females are 34.86 percent (10.83 percent below the rclf of 45.69 percent). this less than expected participation trickles down to administration level (vha, vba, nca, and vaco). a more detailed trigger and barrier analysis is provided at part i of this report. less than expected representation of hispanics: compared with the respective rclf, hispanic males and females (permanent and temporary employees) had less than expected participation in the va workforce. in va, hispanic males represent 3.16 percent of the permanent and temporary workforce and hispanic females represent 3.61 percent, whereas hispanic males represent 3.84 percent of the rclf and 5.17 percent of the clf and hispanic females represent 5.70 percent and 4.79 percent, respectively. the net change for hispanic males (4.83 percent) and females (6.55 percent) is above the net change for the total workforce (4.29 percent), meaning that hispanic males and females are growing at a rate greater than that of the total workforce. this less than expected participation trickles down to the administration level (vha, vba, nca, and vaco). a more detailed trigger and barrier analysis is provided at part i of this report. less than expected representation of asian males: compared with the respective rclf, asian males (permanent and temporary employees) had less than expected participation in the va workforce. in va, asian males represent 2.86 percent of the permanent and temporary workforce, whereas asian males represent 2.95 percent of the rclf. however, the net change for asian males (6.31 percent) is above the net change for the total workforce (4.29 percent), meaning that asian males are growing at a rate above that of the total workforce. this less than expected participation trickles down to administration level (vha, vba, nca, and vaco). a more detailed trigger and barrier analysis is provided at part i of this report. disparate promotion rates: black females experienced lower promotion rates (15.83 percent) as compared to the overall promotion rate (16.82 percent) for permanent entry level positions (gs 3-8). native hawaiian/pacific islander males (nhopim) and females (nhopif) experienced a low promotion rate at the entry and senior level. the promotion rates for nhopims were 15.24 percent and 4.65 percent, respectively. the promotion rates for nhopifs at the entry level were 15.32 percent and 0.00 percent at the senior level. asian females experienced low promotion rates at the entry level and journeyman level only, 11.83 percent and 20.12 percent, respectively. a more detailed trigger and barrier analysis is provided at part i of this report. high volume of discrimination complaints: the per capita filing rate at the informal stage increased from 1.33 percent to 1.43 percent from fy 2014 to fy 2015, while the formal complaint filing rate increased from 0.61 percent to 0.66. these rates remain slightly higher than the government-wide rates of 1.1 percent and .5 percent, respectively. in fy 2015, the number of findings in discrimination increased (29 in fy 2014 and 33 in fy 2015). reprisal, race, and disability were the most prevalent bases of discrimination in those findings. recommended corrective strategies include increasing early resolution of eeo complaints through counseling and adr, reviewing findings and incorporating lessons learned into training, and increasing eeo and consultative services. a more detailed trigger and barrier analysis is provided at part i of this report. less than expected representation in the ses cadre (permanent workforce): with the exception of white, hispanic and the american indian/alaska native males, all the other race/ethnicity and gender groups fall below their expected representation. the representation of white men (45.38 percent) alone is almost double the expected representation (23.05 percent) and most likely serves as the catalyst for the less than expected representation for the other demographic groups. table 6. ses demographics source: vssc – hr database; red font red indicates where es participation fell below workforce benchmark; upward mobility benchmark represents the demographics of the groups focusing on just those occupations (16 occupations) that have the opportunity to advance from gs/gm grade 1 to the ses levels white and hispanic males do quite well compared with the three benchmarks. a more detailed trigger and barrier analysis is provided at part i of this report. summary of planned objectives for fy 2016 the following list summarizes the planned initiatives laid out in part h, i, and j for fy 2016 to eliminate identified barriers or correct program deficiencies. refine anti-harassment program: (1) enhance anti-harassment coordinator (ahc) network, (2) expand case management system, and (3) launch training for employees, supervisors, managers, union officials, and ahcs. continue marketing mycareer@va to additional facilities focusing on career mapping strategies to facilitate career advancement for all groups. continue to track va-wide disciplinary actions taken against rmos in findings of discrimination and report as appropriate in md 715 part g. continue implementation of training evaluation instrument and metrics.

exceeded the administration’s goal of 2 percent and is above the government average of 1.07 percent for fy 2014 (the latest data available). however, this group has a glass ceiling at the gs-10/title 38 equivalent level. approximately 8 percent of the total workforce is in wage grade jobs. about 7.02 percent of the wage grade workforce are iwtds; whereas, for the white collar positions about 1.74 percent are iwtds. in fy 2015, the percent of va’s permanent workforce with a targeted disability increased to 2.17 percent, up from 2.08 percent in fy 2014 and 1.92 percent in fy 2013. the rate of growth, or net change, for the total permanent workforce with targeted disabilities (9.23 percent) was a little less than two times the rate of growth for the entire permanent workforce (4.69 percent), [reference table b1]. this high net change was essential to achieving the on board ratio increase. permanent employees with targeted disabilities are not well represented above gs-10/title 38 equivalent pay levels or at the senior executive level (1.17 percent compared to 1.74 percent for the total workforce). from fy 2014 to 2015, employees with targeted disabilities experienced a marginal increase in their participation rate at the gs-10 and gs-11/title 38 equivalents. there was a marginal decrease at the gs-12, gs-13, gs-14 and 15/title 38 equivalents. with the exception of executive/senior level and mid-level officials and managers (table b3), employees with targeted disabilities made gains in fy 2015 in all other occupational categories. they are now 1.12 percent of the executive/senior level (1.29 percent in fy 2014), and 1.14 percent of mid-level officials and managers (1.27 percent in 2014). the five job series with the largest number of individuals with targeted disabilities are custodial workers (1,031), medical support assistant (591), food service worker (497), miscellaneous clerk and assistant (493), and nurse (346). at the end of fy 2015, 26.28 percent of employees with targeted disabilities in permanent positions were in wage grade occupations, up from 24.53 percent in fy 2014. in comparison, at the end of fy 2015, 6.98 percent of individuals with no disabilities (includes those who did not identify) in permanent positions were in wage grade positions, down from 7.38 percent in fy 2014. generally, the glass ceiling for iwtds in the wage grade occupations occurs at grade 3. approximately, 81 percent of iwtds in wage grades 1 and 2 self-reported having severe intellectual or psychiatric disabilities. this same group is approximately 79 percent of the number of iwtds in wage grade positions. with the exception of one instance, there are no iwtds at wage grades 14 and 15. the top three wage grade occupations for individuals without disabilities (includes those who did not identify) are custodial worker (7,200), food service worker (3,460) and motor vehicle operator (1,326). by legislation, the custodial job series is reserved for veterans. there were 1,031 custodial workers with a targeted disability. in fy 2015, iwtds have a high separation rate (3.34 percent) in the permanent workforce higher than their workforce participation rate (2.16 percent). out of those iwtds who separated from va, 2.35 percent of them had psychiatric disabilities. of the employees with targeted disabilities who were involuntarily separated, 5.93 percent (148) have psychiatric disabilities. of va’s permanent employees with targeted disabilities, 1.30 percent has psychiatric disabilities. while this group is only 2.16 percent of va’s workforce, they were 7.49 percent of involuntary separations. the number of selective placement coordinators and local ra coordinators with the proper skill set remains insufficient throughout the department. the ratio of complaints based on disability remains high. the total number of cases filed (29 cfr § 1614.7049[d]) with a basis of disability increased to 766 in fy2015, up from 635 in fy 2014. va has encountered obstacles in installing assistive technology because each facility has a slightly different infrastructure. accomplishments during fy 2015, the department of veterans affairs (va) continued its efforts toward resurveying the workforce via standard form 256, “self-identification of disability” with the desired expected result as an increase in the representation of iwtd throughout the workforce. in fy 2015, odi trained 184 employees on how to identify less than expected participation rates within their respective facilities and how to apply and utilize the schedule a hiring authority. in addition, odi increased the number of staff allocated to the departmental disability employment program. during fy 2015, odi conducted reasonable accommodation (ra) training on a bi-monthly basis throughout the administrations and central staff offices whereby approximately 2,600 local reasonable accommodation coordinators (lracs), supervisors, and employees received training on ra. the office of information and technology office required all supervisors to attend ra training and as a result, 1,100 personnel were provided this training. in addition, the office of general counsel conducted ra training to all veterans health administration lracs and other personnel involved in the ra process as well as providing quarterly ra sessions titled “conversations with the lawyers”. in direct alignment with the va’s fy 2012-2016 diversity and inclusion strategic plan, there is a centralized resource for reimbursing va field and staff offices for reasonable accommodation expenditures which helps to ensure timely, effective, compliant accommodations for employees and applicants with disabilities. the funding significantly reduces potential barriers to equal opportunity regarding hiring, development, and retention for individuals with disabilities within the workforce. in fy 2015, the total amount of accommodations reimbursed was $274,000. outreach to iwtds is accomplished using public recruiting sources, including opm’s shared list of people with disabilities; one-stop career centers established under the workforce investment act; state vocational rehabilitation agencies and community rehabilitation programs; state employment agencies; employment networks established under the ticket to work program; independent living centers established under title vii of the rehabilitation act; and the department of veterans affairs regional offices. in addition, the veterans employment service office (veso) and odi have formed a partnership to strengthen and broaden outreach efforts to include all individuals with disabilities, including veterans. in fy 2015, va participated in the workforce recruitment program (wrp), which connects federal employers with college students and recent graduates with disabilities. overall, va hired 19 students during the fy 2015 wrp cycle, and there were seven (7) conversions for which wrp students will have an opportunity to become career federal employees. of special note, out of all federal agencies participating in wrp, va ranks number two with regard to wrp conversions. va utilizes many outlets to communicate with the workforce: diversity@work newsletter; diversity news video, and newslink. using these various outlets, va employees are made aware of accomplishments and updates regarding the disability employment program. in addition, regular e-mail communication is sent to selective placement coordinators (spcs) and lracs regarding updates and information on schedule a and ra. during fy 2015, odi made significant efforts to improve the reasonable accommodation compliance system (racs). racs is used as the single source for all ra requests, department-wide. the improvements included: updating the required form documentation in alignment with the americans with disabilities act amendments act of 2008; enhancement of the workflow throughout the system to ensure the system is more intuitive; creation of quick links for user functionality; and broadening the reporting functions to allow for real-time snapshots. these improvements will enable the lracs greater ease in tracking ra requests and all management and employees to receive automated updates throughout the ra process. the mycareer@va initiative was designed to support president obama’s goal of engaging a higher performing diverse federal workforce by creating programs aimed to address career progression barriers and bottle necks experienced by individuals of diverse groups and iwtd in wage grade (wg) positions and at general schedule (gs) grades 9 and below. the 2015 mycareer@va day events directly informed 386 va employees about the mycareer@va program through the employees' participation in at least one of the mycareer@va day activities. additionally, 8,149 va employees learned about mycareer@va as a result of information distributed through the facility-wide marketing and communications. planned activities (this page intentionally left blank) workforce analytical tables (this page intentionally left blank) data shown
