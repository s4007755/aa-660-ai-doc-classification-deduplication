Chinnathambi\nDepartment of Physics, AKGS Arts College, Srivaikundam – 62 8 619, Tamilnadu, India\nIn this manuscript various components of research are liste d and brieﬂy discussed. The topics\nconsidered in this write-up cover a part of the research meth odology paper of Master of Philosophy\n(M.Phil.) course and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) course. T he manuscript is intended for students\nand research scholars of science subjects such as mathemati cs, physics, chemistry, statistics, biology\nand computer science. Various stages of research are discus sed in detail. Special care has been taken\nto motivate the young researchers to take up challenging pro blems. Ten assignment works are given.\nFor the beneﬁt of young researchers a short interview with th ree eminent scientists is included at\nthe end of the manuscript.\nI. WHAT IS RESEARCH?\nResearch is a logical and systematic search for new\nand useful information on a particular topic. It is an\ninvestigation of ﬁnding solutions to scientiﬁc and social\nproblems through objective and systematic analysis. It\nis a search for knowledge, that is, a discovery of hidden\ntruths. Here knowledge means information about mat-\nters. The information might be collected from diﬀerent\nsources like experience, human beings, books, journals,\nnature, etc. A research can lead to new contributions to\nthe existing knowledge. Only through research is it possi-\nble to make progress in a ﬁeld. Research is done with the\nhelp of study, experiment, observation, analysis, compar-\nison and reasoning. Research is in fact ubiquitous. For\nexample, we know that cigarette smoking is injurious to\nhealth; heroine is addictive; cow dung is a useful source\nof biogas; malaria is due to the virus protozoan plasmod-\nium; AIDS (Acquired Immuno Deﬁciency Syndrome) is\ndue to the virus HIV (Human Immuno deﬁciency Virus).\nHow did we know all these? We became aware of all\nthese information only through research. More precisely,\nit seeks predictions of events and explanations, relation-\nships and theories for them.\nA.What are the Objectives of\nResearch?\nThe prime objectives of research are\n(1) to discover new facts\n(2) to verify and test important facts\n∗Electronic address: rajasekar@physics.bdu.ac.in(3) to analyse an event or process or phenomenon to\nidentify the cause and eﬀect relationship\n(4) to develop new scientiﬁc tools, concepts and theo-\nries to solve and understand scientiﬁc and nonsci-\nentiﬁc problems\n(5) to ﬁnd solutions to scientiﬁc, nonscientiﬁc and so-\ncial problems and\n(6) to overcome or solve the problems occurring in our\nevery day life.\nB.What Makes People do Research?\nThis is a fundamentally important question. No person\nwould like to do research unless there are some motivating\nfactors . Some of the motivations are the following:\n(1) to get a research degree (Doctor of Philosophy\n(Ph.D.)) along with its beneﬁts like better employ-\nment, promotion, increment in salary, etc.\n(2) to get a research degree and then to get a teach-\ning position in a college or university or become a\nscientist in a research institution\n(3) to get a research position in countries like U.S.A.,\nCanada, Germany, England, Japan, Australia, etc.\nand settle there\n(4) to solve the unsolved and challenging problems\n(5) to get joy of doing some creative work\n(6) to acquire respectability\n(7) to get recognition\n(8) curiosity to ﬁnd out the unknown facts of an event\n2\n(9) curiosity to ﬁnd new things\n(10) to serve the society by solving social problems.\nSome students undertake research without any aim pos-\nsibly because of not being able to think of anything else\nto do. Such students can also become good researchers\nby motivating themselves toward a respectable goal.\nIn the words of Prof.P.Balaram [Current Science,\n87(2004)1319] Ph.D. degree is a passport to a research ca-\nreer. The Ph.D. period often inﬂuence a research scholar\nto make or to break in a scientiﬁc career.\nC.Importance of Research\nResearch is important both in scientiﬁc and nonscien-\ntiﬁc ﬁelds. In our life new problems, events, phenom-\nena and processes occur every day. Practically imple-\nmentable solutions and suggestions are required for tack-\nling new problems that arise. Scientists have to under-\ntake research on them and ﬁnd their causes, solutions,\nexplanations and applications. Precisely, research assis ts\nus to understand nature and natural phenomena.\nSome important avenues for research are:\n(1) A research problem refers to a diﬃculty which a re-\nsearcher or a scientiﬁc community or an industry or\na government organization or a society experiences.\nIt may be a theoretical or a practical situation. It\ncalls for a thorough understanding and possible so-\nlution.\n(2) Research on existing theories and concepts help us\nidentify the range and applications of them.\n(3) It is the fountain of knowledge and provide guide-\nlines for solving problems.\n(4) Research provides basis for many government poli-\ncies. For example, research on the needs and desires\nof the people and on the availability of revenues to\nmeet the needs helps a government to prepare a\nbudget.\n(5) It is important in industry and business for higher\ngain and productivity and to improve the quality\nof products.\n(6) Mathematical and logical research on business and\nindustry optimizes the problems in them.\n(7) It leads to the identiﬁcation and characterization\nof new materials, new living things, new stars, etc.\n(8) Only through research can inventions be made; for\nexample, new and novel phenomena and processes\nsuch as superconductivity and cloning have been\ndiscovered only through research.(9) Social research helps ﬁnd answers to social prob-\nlems. They explain social phenomena and seek so-\nlution to social problems.\n(10) Research leads to a new style of life and makes it\ndelightful and glorious .\nEmphasizing the importance of research Louis Pasteur\nsaid “I beseech you to take interest in these sacred do-\nmains called laboratories. Ask that there be more and\nthat they be adorned for these are the temples of the\nfuture, wealth and well-being. It is here that human-\nity will learn to read progress and individual harmony\nin the works of nature, while humanity’s own works are\nall too often those of babarism, fanaticism and destruc-\ntion.” (Louis Paster – article by S.Mahanti, Dream 2047,\np.29–34 (May 2003)).\nIn order to know what it means to do research one may\nread scientiﬁc autobiographies like Richard Feynmann’s\n“Surely you are joking, Mr.Feynmann!”, Jim Watson’s\n“The double helix”, “Science as a way of life – A biogra-\nphy of C.N.R. Rao” by Mohan Sundararajan, etc.\nII. RESEARCH METHODS AND RESEARCH\nMETHODOLOGY\nIs there any diﬀerence between research methods and\nresearch methodology?\nResearch methods are the various procedures,\nschemes, algorithms, etc. used in research. All the\nmethods used by a researcher during a research study\nare termed as research methods . They are essentially\nplanned, scientiﬁc and value-neutral. They include\ntheoretical procedures, experimental studies, numerical\nschemes, statistical approaches, etc. Research methods\nhelp us collect samples, data and ﬁnd a solution to a\nproblem. Particularly, scientiﬁc research methods call\nfor explanations based on collected facts, measurements\nand observations and not on reasoning alone. They ac-\ncept only those explanations which can be veriﬁed by\nexperiments.\nResearch methodology is a systematic way to solve\na problem. It is a science of studying how research is\nto be carried out. Essentially, the procedures by which\nresearchers go about their work of describing, explaining\nand predicting phenomena are called research methodol-\nogy.It is also deﬁned as the study of methods by which\nknowledge is gained. Its aim is to give the work plan of\nresearch.\nA.Importance of Research Methodology\n3\nin Research Study\nIt is necessary for a researcher to design a methodol-\nogy for the problem chosen. One should note that even\nif the method considered in two problems are same the\nmethodology may be diﬀerent. It is important for the re-\nsearcher to know not only the research methods necessary\nfor the research under taken but also the methodology.\nFor example, a researcher not only needs to know how to\ncalculate mean, variance and distribution function for a\nset of data, how to ﬁnd a solution of a physical system\ndescribed by mathematical model, how to determine the\nroots of algebraic equations and how to apply a particu-\nlar method but also need to know (i) which is a suitable\nmethod for the chosen problem?, (ii) what is the order\nof accuracy of the result of a method?, (iii) what is the\neﬃciency of the method? and so on. Consideration of\nthese aspects constitute a research methodology.\nTo understand the diﬀerence between research meth-\nods and methodology let us consider the problem of ﬁnd-\ning the roots of the quadratic equation\nax2+bx+c= 0. (1)\nThe formulas often used for calculating the roots of eq.(1)\nare\nx+=−b+√\nb2−4ac\n2a, (2)\nx−=−b−√\nb2−4ac\n2a· (3)\nThese formulas are, however, inaccurate when |b| ≈√\nb2−4ac. The equivalent formulas are\nx+=−2c\nb+√\nb2−4ac, (4)\nx−=−2c\nb−√\nb2−4ac. (5)\nWhen |b| ≈√\nb2−4acone must proceed with caution to\navoid loss of precision. If b >0, then x+should be com-\nputed with the formula given by eq.(2) and x−should be\ncomputed with the formula given by eq.(3). If b <0 then\nx+should be evaluated using eq.(4) and x−should be\nevaluated using eq.(5). Here the two formulas constitute\nthe method of ﬁnding roots of the equation of the form\ngiven by eq.(1). If you use the formulas given by eqs.(4–\n5) instead of the formulas given by eqs.(2–3) (often used\nand familiar to us) to compute the roots then you should\nclearly explain why the formulas in eqs.(4–5) were chosen\nand why the other formulas given by eqs.(2–3) were not\nconsidered. This is what we mean by a research method-\nology. That is, research methodology tells you which\nmethod or formula or algorithm has to be used out of\nthe various existing methods or formulas or algorithms.\nMore precisely, research methods help us get a solution\nto a problem. On the other hand, research methodology\nis concerned with the explanation of the following:(1) Why is a particular research study undertaken?\n(2) How did one formulate a research problem?\n(3) What types of data were collected?\n(4) What particular method has been used?\n(5) Why was a particular technique of analysis of data\nused?\nThe study of research methods gives training to apply\nthem to a problem. The study of research methodology\nprovides us the necessary training in choosing methods,\nmaterials, scientiﬁc tools and training in techniques rel-\nevant for the problem chosen.\nAssignment:\n(1) List out at least 10 methods which you have learned\nin your UG and PG courses and write their purpose\nor application.\n(2) Distinguish between research methods and research\ntechniques.\n(3) Distinguish between research methods and research\nmethodology with an example of your own choice.\nIII. TYPES OF RESEARCH\nResearch is broadly classiﬁed into two main classes:\n1. Fundamental or basic research\n2. Applied research\nA.Basic Research\nBasic research is an investigation on basic principles\nand reasons for occurrence of a particular event or pro-\ncess or phenomenon. It is also called theoretical research .\nStudy or investigation of some natural phenomenon or re-\nlating to pure science are termed as basic research . Basic\nresearches some times may not lead to immediate use or\napplication. It is not concerned with solving any prac-\ntical problems of immediate interest. But it is original\nor basic in character. It provides a systematic and deep\ninsight into a problem and facilitates extraction of scien-\ntiﬁc and logical explanation and conclusion on it. It helps\nbuild new frontiers of knowledge. The outcomes of basic\nresearch form the basis for many applied research. Re-\nsearchers working on applied research have to make use\nof the outcomes of basic research and explore the utility\nof them.\nResearch on improving a theory or a method is also\nreferred as fundamental research. For example, suppose\n4\na theory is applicable to a system provided the system\nsatisﬁes certain speciﬁc conditions. Modifying the theory\nto apply it to a general situation is a basic research.\nAttempts to ﬁnd answers to the following questions ac-\ntually form basic research. Why are materials like that?\nWhat they are? How does a crystal melt? Why is sound\nproduced when water is heated? Why do we feel diﬃcult\nwhen walking on seashore? Why are birds arrange them\nin ‘>’ shape when ﬂying in a group?\nFundamental research leads to a new theory or a new\nproperty of matter or even the existence of a new matter,\nthe knowledge of which has not been known or reported\nearlier. For example, fundamental research on\n(1) astronomy may lead to identiﬁcation of new planets\nor stars in our galaxy,\n(2) elementary particles results in identiﬁcation of new\nparticles,\n(3) complex functions may leads to new patterns or\nnew properties associated with them,\n(4) diﬀerential equations results in new types of solu-\ntions or new properties of solutions not known so\nfar.\n(5) chemical reactions leads to development of new\ncompounds, new properties of chemicals, mecha-\nnism of chemicals reactions, etc.\n(6) medicinal chemistry leads to an understanding of\nphysiological action of various chemicals and drugs.\n(7) structure, contents and functioning of various parts\nof human body helps us identify the basis for cer-\ntain diseases.\nB.Applied Research\nIn anapplied research one solves certain problems em-\nploying well known and accepted theories and principles.\nMost of the experimental research, case studies and inter-\ndisciplinary research are essentially applied research. A p-\nplied research is helpful for basic research. A research,\nthe outcome of which has immediate application is also\ntermed as applied research . Such a research is of prac-\ntical use to current activity. For example, research on\nsocial problems have immediate use. Applied research is\nconcerned with actual life research such as research on\nincreasing eﬃciency of a machine, increasing gain factor\nof production of a material, pollution control, preparing\nvaccination for a disease, etc. Obviously, they have im-\nmediate potential applications.\nSome of the diﬀerences between basic and applied re-\nsearch are summarized in table 1.1. Thus, the centralaim of applied research is to ﬁnd a solution for a practi-\ncal problem which warrants solution for immediate use,\nwhereas basic research is directed towards ﬁnding infor-\nmation that has broad base of applications and thus add\nnew information to the already existing scientiﬁc knowl-\nedge.\nC.Quantitative and Qualitative\nMethods\nThe basic and applied researches can be quantitative or\nqualitative or even both. Quantitative research is based\non the measurement of quantity or amount. Here a pro-\ncess is expressed or described in terms of one or more\nquantities. Qualitative research is concerned with quali-\ntative phenomenon involving quality. It is non-numerical,\ndescriptive, applies reasoning and uses words. Its aim is\nto get the meaning, feeling and describe the situation.\nWe measure and weigh things in the study of substance\nor structure. Can we measure or weigh patterns? We\ncannot measure or weigh patterns. But to study pat-\nterns we must map a conﬁguration of relationships. That\nis, structures involve quantities whereas patterns involv e\nqualities. If one wishes to investigate why certain data\nare random then it is a qualitative research. If the aim\nis to study how random the data is, what is the mean,\nvariance and distribution function then it becomes quan-\ntitative. Explaining how digestion of food takes place in\nour body is a qualitative description. It does not involve\nany numbers or data and quantities.\nThe detection of a particular compound is a qualitative\nanalysis. This can be done by carrying out physical or\nchemical tests. Determination of exact amount of a par-\nTABLE I: Diﬀerences between basic and applied researches.\nBasic research Applied research\nSeeks generalization Studies individual or speciﬁc\ncases without the objective to\ngeneralize\nAims at basic processes Aims at any variable which\nmakes the desired diﬀerence\nAttempts to explain why\nthings happenTries to say how things can be\nchanged\nTries to get all the facts Tries to correct the facts\nwhich are problematic\nReports in technical language\nof the topicReports in common language\n5\nticular compound present in a volume is essentially quan-\ntitative analysis. This can be done by volumetric, gravi-\nmetric and calorimetric methods or instrumental meth-\nods. Experimental and simulation studies are generally\nquantitative research.\nD.Other Types of Research\nOther types of research include action research (fact\nﬁndings to improve the quality of action in the social\nworld), explanatory research (searching explanations for\nevents and phenomena, for example ﬁnding answer to\nthe question why are the things like what they are?), ex-\nploratory research (getting more information on a topic)\nandcomparative research (obtaining similarities and dif-\nferences between events, methods, techniques, etc.). For\ndiscussion on these types of research see refs.[1–3].\nAssignment:\n(4) List out at least 10 theoretical and applied methods\nwhich you have learned in your UG, PG courses and\nwrite their features in two or three sentences.\n(5) Write at least 20 questions in your subject the in-\nvestigation of which forms basic research. Then\npoint out how many of them have already been\nsolved and how many were found in applications.\n(6) Distinguish between theory and experiment.\n(7) Write a note on importance of theory in basic and\napplied researches.\n(8) Bring out the importance of inter-disciplinary re-\nsearch.\nIV. VARIOUS STAGES OF A RESEARCH\nWhenever a scientiﬁc problem is to be solved there\nare several important steps to follow. The problem must\nbe stated clearly, including any simplifying assumptions.\nThen develop a mathematical statement of the problem.\nThis process may involve use of one or more mathemat-\nical procedures. Frequently, more advanced text books\nor review articles will be needed to learn about the tech-\nniques and procedures. Next, the results have to be in-\nterpreted to arrive at a decision. This will require ex-\nperience and an understanding of the situation in which\nthe problem is embedded. A general set of sequential\ncomponents of research is the following:\n1. Selection of a research topic\n2. Deﬁnition of a research problem\n3. Literature survey and reference collection4. Assessment of current status of the topic chosen\n5. Formulation of hypotheses\n6. Research design\n7. Actual investigation\n8. Data analysis\n9. Interpretation of result\n10. Report\nIn the following sections the above mentioned various\nstages of research are discussed in detail.\nV. SELECTION OF A RESEARCH TOPIC AND\nPROBLEM\nThe starting point of a research is the selection of a\nresearch topic and problem. Identifying a suitable topic\nfor work is one of the most diﬃcult parts of a research.\nBefore choosing a research topic and a problem the young\nresearchers should keep the following points in mind.\n•Topic should be suitable for research.\n•The researcher should have interest in it.\n•Topic should not be chosen by compulsion from\nsome one else.\nTopic and problem can be ﬁxed in consultation with the\nresearch supervisor. In our country often research su-\npervisors suggest a topic and state a problem in broad\nview. The researcher has to narrow it and deﬁne it in\noperational form. One may ask: Is it necessary that the\ntopic of a Ph.D. should be diﬀerent from M.Sc. project\nand M.Phil dissertation? The answer is not necessary.\nIf a student is able to get a supervisor working in his\nM.Sc.project or M.Phil dissertation topic then it would\nsave about six months in the duration of his Ph.D. work.\nA.Can a Researcher Choose a Topic\nby himself?\nA youngster interested to start a research career wishes\nto know whether he/she has freedom to do research in the\ntopic of his/her own interest. The style of research in our\ncountry and various other factors like the infrastructure\nfacility available in a research institute, time limit, our\ncommitment to family and social set up hardly allow a\nyoung researcher to choose a topic by himself for his PG\nproject, M.Phil. dissertation and Ph.D. thesis. How-\never, many research supervisors give complete freedom\nto choose a problem in the topic suggested by him for a\nPh.D. research work. Because the normal time duration\nof M.Phil dissertation is about 6-8 months, it is better to\nwork on the problem suggested by the supervisor.\n6\nIf a student wishes to do research (for Ph.D. degree)\nwith fellowship then he cannot have freedom to choose a\ntopic since he has to work on a project the goal of which\nis already deﬁned by the project investigator. On the\nother hand, after choosing a topic of his own interest he\nhas to ﬁnd a supervisor who is working in that topic or\ninterested in guiding him. In this case one has severe\nlimitation in our country for getting a fellowship and for\nregistering for a research degree. If a student is not very\nmuch particular about the fellowship he has a chance to\ndo research in the topic of his own interest. A researcher\nin India after two years of research experience with few\n(two or more) publications can apply for a senior research\nfellowship (SRF) to CSIR (Council for Scientiﬁc and In-\ndustrial Research) (for details see its and other relevant\nweb sites). He can prepare a project under the direction\nof his Ph.D. supervisor which can lead to a fellowship.\nFor details see the book ‘How to get scholarships, Fel-\nlows and Stipends’ by K.D.Kalaskar (Sultan Chand and\nSons, New Delhi))\nConsidering the above, a researcher should make-up\nhis mind so as to work in a topic suggested by the super-\nvisor. However, a research problem may be chosen by a\nresearcher himself. This has several advantages. In this\ncase\n•the researcher can pursue his/her own interest to\nthe farthest limits,\n•there is an opportunity to spend a long time on\nsomething that is a continuous source of his plea-\nsure and\n•the results would prove better in terms of the\ngrowth of the investigator and the quality of the\nwork.\nIf the researcher is not interested in the topic and prob-\nlem assigned to him but is working on it because of su-\npervisor’s compulsion, then he will not be able to face\nand overcome the obstacles which come at every stage in\nresearch.\nB.Identiﬁcation of a Research Topic\nand Problems\nSome sources of identiﬁcation of a research topic and\nproblems are the following:\n(1) Theory of one’s own interest\n(2) Daily problems\n(3) Technological changes\n(4) Recent trends\n(5) Unexplored areas(6) Discussion with experts and research supervisor\nSuppose one is interested in the theory of nonlinear dif-\nferential equations or quasicrystals or fullerenes. Then h e\ncan ﬁnd a research guide who is working in this ﬁeld or\ninterested to work in this ﬁeld and then choose a problem\nfor research.\nOur daily experiences and day to aﬀairs have rich open-\nings on various aspects such as the daunting tasks of\nAIDS, air pollution, aﬀorestation and deforestation, chil d\nlabor, problems of aged citizens, etc.\nTechnology in various branches of science, business and\nmarketing changes rapidly. For example, in the early\nyears, computers were built in larger size with vacuum\ntubes. Then evolution in electronic technology replaced\nthem by integrated circuits. Recently, scientists have de-\nveloped quantum dots. Now the interest is in developing\neﬃcient, super-fast and miniaturized computing machine\nmade up of material whose particle size of the order of\nnano (10−9) meter or even smaller. Similarly, another\nfascinating topic namely, thin ﬁlm has multiple ﬁelds of\napplications. Recent research on fullerenes resulted in\nmany practical applications.\nChoosing a topic of current interest or recent trends\nprovides bright and promising opportunities for young\nresearchers to get post-doctoral fellowship, position in\nleading institutions in our nation and abroad.\nIn each subject there are several topics which are not\nexplored in detail even though the topic was considered\nby scientists long time ago. For example, string theory,\nquantum computing, nano particles, quantum cloning\nand quantum cryptography and gene immunology are\nfascinating topics and are in preliminary stages.\nThe supervisors and experts are working on one or few\nﬁelds over a long time and they are the specialists in the\nﬁeld considered and well versed with the development\nand current status of the ﬁeld. Therefore, a young re-\nsearcher can make use of their expertise in knowing var-\nious possible problems in the topic the solving of which\nprovide better opportunities in all aspects.\nDon’t choose a topic simply because it is fascinating.\nIn choosing a topic one should take care of the possibil-\nity of data collection, quantity of gain, breadth of the\ntopic and so on. The topic should not be too narrow.\nFor example, the study of social status and sexual life\nof married couples of same sex (man-man marriage and\nwoman-woman marriage) is interesting and of social rel-\nevance. But the intricate problem here is that we do\nnot ﬁnd enough number of such couples to study. This\nis a very narrow topic at the same time we will not get\nenough data to analyze. On the other hand, the changes\nin the social life of aravanis in recent times is a valuable\nsocial problem and one can collect enough data.\n7\nFurther, one has to study advanced level text books\nand latest research articles to identify problems. Is it\nnecessary to know all the methods, techniques, concepts\nin a research topic before identifying a problem for in-\nvestigation? This is not necessary. After learning some\nfundamental concepts, recent developments and current\ntrends of a topic, one can identify a problem for research.\nThen he can learn the tools necessary to solve it.\nC.Deﬁnition and Formulation of a\nProblem\nAfter identifying a problem, in order to solve it, it has\nto be deﬁned and formulated properly. For this purpose,\none can execute the following.\n•State the problem in questionnaire form or in an\nequivalent form\n•Specify the problem in detail and in precise terms\n•List the assumptions made\n•Remove the ambiguities, if any, in the statement of\nthe problem\n•Examine the feasibility of a particular solution\nDeﬁning the problem is more important than its solution.\nIt is a crucial part of the research study and should not\nbe deﬁned in hurry.\nD.How do you Asses Whether the\nDeﬁned Problem as a Good Problem?\nA problem in its ﬁrst deﬁnition may not be appealing.\nIt may require redeﬁnition in order to make it a good\nproblem. That is, by suitably rewording or reformulating\nthe chosen problem, it can be made to meet the criteria\nof a good problem. This is also important to solve the\nproblem successfully. To this end a researcher can ask a\nseries of questions on the problem. Some are:\n(1) Is the problem really interesting to him and to the\nscientiﬁc community?\n(2) Is the problem signiﬁcant to the present status of\nthe topic?\n(3) Is there suﬃcient supervision/guidance?\n(4) Can the problem be solved in the required time\nframe?\n(5) Are the necessary equipment, adequate library and\ncomputational facilities, etc. available?\nIf the answers to these questions are satisfactory, then the\nresearcher can initiate work on the chosen problem. In\naddition, discuss the problem with the current doctoral\nstudents and obtain the scope of the problem and other\nrelated aspects.E.How are these Questions Important\nand Relevant to a Researcher?\nThe researcher should be interested on the problem for\nthe reasons mentioned earlier at the end of the Sec.(V A).\nThe problem should also be interesting to the supervisor\nso that the researcher can get the necessary guidance\nfrom him. Otherwise sometimes the researcher may ﬁnd\nit very diﬃcult to convince the supervisor on the im-\nportance and signiﬁcance of the results obtained. More\nimportantly, the problem must be of interest to scien-\ntiﬁc community and society. If not then the researcher\nwill ﬁnd great diﬃculty to publish his ﬁndings in reputed\njournals and convince the funding agency.\nNext, the status of the problem, particularly the im-\nportance of ﬁnding its solution should match with the\ncurrent status of the ﬁeld. But, if the problem investi-\ngated is of not much interest to science and society then\npublications will become useless to him in his research ca-\nreer. Speciﬁcally, they cannot help earn a post-doctoral\nfellowship, respectability and a permanent job in an in-\nstitution.\nA researcher needs proper guidance and encourage-\nment from the supervisor regularly. This is important\nfor keeping the research in right track, to overcome the\ndiﬃculties which come at various states of research and\nalso to have moral support. A researcher should avoid\nworking under the guidance of a supervisor having seri-\nous health problems or family problems, committed his\nlarge time to administrative work and strong involvement\nin nonacademic matters.\nAnother important point is that before initiating re-\nsearch work on a problem, a rough estimate on costs and\ntime required to complete the work must be made. A\nproblem suitable for Ph.D. degree should not be taken\nfor M.Phil. degree. A problem suitable for M.Phil. de-\ngree is not appropriate for Master’s degree. If the col-\nlection of data or resources or related information takes\nmany years, then the topic is obviously inappropriate for\nPh.D. degree. Controversial subjects should not be cho-\nsen. Problems that are too narrow or too vague should\nbe avoided.\nFinally, the researcher must make sure that the neces-\nsary experimental setup and materials to perform the ac-\ntual research work are available in the department where\nresearch work is to be carried out. Without these, if\nthe researcher initiated the work and has gone through\ncertain stages of work or spent one or two years in the\nproblem then in order to complete the task he would\nbe forced to buy the materials and instruments from his\npersonal savings.\n8\nVI. LITERATURE SURVEY\nAfter deﬁning a problem, the researcher has to do lit-\nerature survey connected with the problem. Literature\nsurvey is a collection of research publications, books and\nother documents related to the deﬁned problem . It is very\nessential to know whether the deﬁned problem has al-\nready been solved, status of the problem, techniques that\nare useful to investigate the problem and other related\ndetails. One can survey\n(1) the journals which publish abstracts of papers pub-\nlished in various journals,\n(2) review articles related to the topic chosen,\n(3) journals which publish research articles,\n(4) advanced level books on the chosen topic,\n(5) proceedings of conferences, workshops, etc.,\n(6) reprint/preprint collections available with the su-\npervisor and nearby experts working on the topic\nchosen and\n(7) Internet.\nA free e-print service provider for physics, mathematics,\nnonlinear science, computer science and biology is\nhttp://www.arXiv.org\nNo research shall be complete unless we make use of\nthe knowledge available in books, journals and internet.\nReview of the literature in the area of research is a pre-\nliminary step before attempting to plan the study.\nLiterature survey helps us\n(1) sharpen the problem, reformulate it or even leads\nto deﬁning other closely related problems,\n(2) get proper understanding of the problem chosen,\n(3) acquire proper theoretical and practical knowledge\nto investigate the problem,\n(4) show how the problem under study relates to the\nprevious research studies and\n(5) know whether the proposed problem had already\nbeen solved.\nThrough survey one can collect relevant information\nabout the problem. Clarity of ideas can be acquired\nthrough study of literature.\nApart from literature directly connected with the prob-\nlem, the literature that is connected with similar prob-\nlems is also useful. It helps formulate the problem in a\nclear-cut way. A review on past work helps us know the\noutcome of those investigations where similar problems\nwere solved. It can help us design methodology for the\npresent work. We can also explore the vital links with thevarious trends and phases in the chosen topic and famil-\niarize with characteristic precepts, concepts and interpr e-\ntations. Further, it can help us formulate a satisfactory\nstructure of the research proposal.\nBecause a Ph.D. thesis or M.Phil. dissertation is a\nstudy in depth aiming contribution to knowledge, a care-\nful check should be made to ensure that the proposed\nstudy has not previously been performed and reported.\nThe earlier studies which are relevant to the problem cho-\nsen should be carefully studied. Ignorance of prior stud-\nies may lead to a researcher duplicating a work already\ncarried out by another researcher. A good library will be\nof great help to a researcher at this stage. One can visit\nnearby research institutions and avail the library facilit y.\nReview the latest research papers and Ph.D. theses to\nacquire recent trends.\nVII. REFERENCE COLLECTION\nAs soon as the survey of available source begins, the\npreparation and collection of references preferably with\nannotations should be undertaken. The important source\nof reference collection is the journal called Current Con-\ntents. This comes once in a week. It is available in hard\ncopy and also in ﬂoppy diskette. Almost all the universi-\nties and institutions buy this document. It contains the\ntable of content of research journals and magazines in\nvarious subjects. It provides title of articles, names of\nthe authors, date of publication, volume number, start-\ning page number of the articles and address of the author\nfrom whom one can get the reprint of the article. If the\ntitle of the article indicates that the paper is in the topic\nof one’s interest then he can take a copy of the article if\nthe journal is available in the local library. Otherwise,\nhe can get it from a document delivery service centre.\nFor example, in India INFLIBNET provides this service\nthrough six institutions. For details visit the following\nweb sites:\nhttp://web.inﬂibnet.ac.in/index.isp\nhttp://www.iisc.ernet.in/\nhttp://www.jnu.ac.in/\nOne can obtain a research article on paying the charge\nﬁxed by the INFLIBNET provided the particular journal\nis available in it. Articles can also be purchased from the\npublishers on payment. Alternatively, reprint of the arti-\ncle can be had from the author by sending a letter/card\nto the author. A format of reprint request card is shown\nbelow.\n9\n————————————————————————-\nFront Side\nPlace:\nDate :\nDear Dr./Prof.\nI would appreciate in receiving a reprint of your following\narticle and other related preprints/reprints, if any.\nTitle :\nJournal name :\nVolume number: Page(s): Year:\nWith kind regards,\nYours sincerely,\n————————————————————————-\n————————————————————————-\nReverse Side\nSender’s Address\nTo\n————————————————————————-\nThe references from current contents or from journals\ncan be noted on a separate card or sheet with the names\nof authors and the title of the paper/book, etc. For a\nresearch paper, its title, journal name, volume number,\nstarting and ending pages of it and year of publication\nshould be noted. For a book, publisher’s name, place\nof publication and year of publication must be written\ndown. Instead of cards, nowadays one can store the de-\ntails of the references in computers and have a copy in\ntwo or three ﬂoppy diskette. The references can be clas-\nsiﬁed. For example, sources dealing with theory, dealing\nwith experimental techniques, concerned with numerical\nmethods, etc. can be grouped separately. The copies of\nthe research articles can also be classiﬁed and bounded.\nCross references (that is research articles or books re-\nferred or cited in a research report) should also be col-\nlected and classiﬁed. These also provide useful informa-\ntion.\nVIII. ASSESSING THE CURRENT STATUS\nGenerally, it is not diﬃcult to know the current status\nof research work in a speciﬁc topic. The current sta-\ntus of the chosen topic can be identiﬁed by reading the\nrelevant journals and the recent papers, discussions in\nconferences, seminars and workshops. One can perform\ninquiries at several important places known for research\non proposed topic.A study of the current literature in the chosen topic ex-\nplores the current status of it. More importantly, review\narticles point out not only to the basic aspects and fea-\ntures of the topic concerned but also give a brief account\nof its present status. For this purpose, one can survey the\njournals (for a topic in physics) such as Physics Reports,\nReviews of Modern Physics, Physical Review Letters, Re-\nview section of American Journal of Physics, Pramana,\nCurrent Science and Proceedings of recently conducted\nseminars and conferences, etc.\nRapid communication and Letter sections of interna-\ntional journals publish articles which are very important\nand fall in recent trends category. There are several areas\nin internet where the papers just submitted to journals\nare placed. One can download such articles free of cost.\nThese articles indicate the recent trends in a particular\ntopic. Some relevant web sites are listed below.\nhttp://arxiv.org/\nhttp://www.ams.org/global-preprints/\nhttp://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.AG/\nhttp://www.ma.utexas.edu/mp −arc/\nhttp://www.cliﬀord.org/anonftp/clf-alg/\nIX. HYPOTHESIS\nResearchers do not carry out work without any aim\nor expectation. Research is not of doing something and\npresenting what is done. Every research problem is un-\ndertaken aiming at certain outcomes. That is, before\nstarting actual work such as performing an experiment\nor theoretical calculation or numerical analysis, we ex-\npect certain outcomes from the study. The expectations\nform the hypothesis. Hypotheses are scientiﬁcally reason-\nable predictions . They are often stated in terms of if-then\nsentences in certain logical forms. A hypothesis should\nprovide what we expect to ﬁnd in the chosen research\nproblem. In other words, the expected or proposed solu-\ntions based on available data and tentative explanations\nconstitute the hypothesis.\nHypothesizing is done only after survey of relevant lit-\nerature and learning the present status of the ﬁeld of\nresearch. It can be formulated based on previous re-\nsearch and observation. To formulate a hypothesis the\nresearcher should acquire enough knowledge in the topic\nof research and a reasonably deep insight about the prob-\nlem. In formulating a hypothesis construct operational\ndeﬁnitions of variables in the research problem. Hypoth-\nesis is due to an intelligent guess or for inspiration which\nis to be tested in the research work rigorously through\nappropriate methodology. Testing of hypothesis leads to\nexplanation of the associated phenomenon or event.\nWhat are the criteria of a good hypothesis? An hy-\n10\npothesis should have conceptual clarity and a theoretical\norientation. Further, it should be testable. It should\nbe stated in a suitable way so that it can be tested by\ninvestigation. A hypothesis made initially may become\nincorrect when the data obtained are analyzed. In this\ncase it has to be revised. It is important to state the\nhypothesis of a research problem in a research report.\nWe note that if a hypothesis withstands the experiments\nand provides the required facts to make it acceptable, not\nonly to the researchers performing the experiments but\nto others doing other experiments then when suﬃciently\nreinforced by continual veriﬁcation the hypothesis may\nbecome a theory [4].\nX. MODE OF APPROACH\nMode of approach means the manner in which research\nis to be carried out. It should keep the researcher on the\nright track and make him complete the planned work suc-\ncessfully . One should sharpen the thinking and focus\nattention on the more important aspects of the study.\nThe scientiﬁc thinking must be more formal, strict, em-\npirical and speciﬁc and more over goal oriented. In or-\nder to make steady progress in research and to asses the\nprogress of the research work, a research design is very\nhelpful.\nA.Research Design\nFor a scientiﬁc research one has to prepare a research\ndesign. It should indicate the various approaches to be\nused in solving the research problem, sources and infor-\nmation related to the problem and, time frame and the\ncost budget. Essentially, the research design creates the\nfoundation of the entire research work. The design will\nhelp perform the chosen task easily and in a systematic\nway. Once the research design is completed the actual\nwork can be initiated. The ﬁrst step in the actual work is\nto learn the facts pertaining to the problem. Particularly,\ntheoretical methods, numerical techniques, experimental\ntechniques and other relevant data and tools necessary\nfor the present study have to be collected and learnt.\nIt is not necessary that every theory, technique and\ninformation in the topic of research is useful for a partic-\nular problem. A researcher has to identify and select\nmaterials which are useful to the present work. Fur-\nther, the validity and utility of the information gathered\nshould be tested before using them. Scientiﬁc research\nis based on certain mathematical, numerical and experi-\nmental methods. These sources have to be properly stud-\nied and judged before applying them to the problem of\ninterest.\nB.What are the Possible Approachesto be Followed by a Researcher?\nA researcher can exercise the following aspects regu-\nlarly throughout the research carrier. These will keep\nhim in right track and tightly bind him to the research\nactivity.\n(1) Discussion with the supervisor, experts and col-\nleagues about the research work, particularly, the\nproblem and its origin, objectives and diﬃculties\nfaced in the execution of the problem.\n(2) Reading of the latest research papers, relevant theo-\nries and possible application to the present problem\nand to overcome the diﬃculties faced.\n(3) Review of the work reported on the similar prob-\nlems.\n(4) Theoretical calculations, setting-up of an exper-\nimental setup, numerical calculations, computer\nprograms, preparation of graphs, tables and other\nrelevant work related to the research should be done\nby a new researcher by himself without assistance\nfrom others.\n(5) Have a practice of periodically writing the work\ndone, results obtained and steps followed in a work.\nThis is important because sometime we may think\nthat a particular aspect will be a center piece of the\nproblem under investigation. But once we make a\nwrite-up of it, this aspect or part of it may turn out\nto be only of marginal importance. In fact, writ-\ning of the progress of the work will help us better\nunderstand our work and forms a solid basis for\nfurther progress. It also points out to the gaps in\nour work.\n(6) Participation and presentation of research ﬁndings\nin national and international meetings.\nThese regular practices provide useful information like\nnew ideas and can help the researcher\n(1) sharpen and focus attention,\n(2) conﬁning to the formulation and\n(3) in the interpretation of the solution obtained.\nEach and every bit of task related to the research work\nhas to be done by the researcher. A young researcher\nshould not do the entire work in collaboration with oth-\ners. The researcher is advised to perform all the works\nstarting from identiﬁcation of the problem to report\npreparation by himself under the guidance of supervisor.\nParticularly, collaboration work with experts and senior\nresearcher may be avoided. (However, he can discuss his\nproblems with them). This is important to acquire\n(1) enough knowledge,\n11\n(2) conﬁdence and\n(3) training\nto carry out research independently after getting Ph.D.\ndegree. Part of the dissertation should demonstrate the\nresearcher’s originality. The dissertation should reﬂect\nthe eﬀorts of a single researcher. Keeping this in mind\none should avoid collaboration as far as possible in the\nyoung stage.\nProf.Balaram wrote “There are guides who have no\ninterest in their discipline and leave their wards to their\nown devices. Surprisingly, it is these guides who produce\nsome of the most resilient scientists, self-taught men and\nwomen, who develop great conﬁdence in their abilities”\n[Current Science 87(2004)1319].\nA researcher should provide new information to the\nsupervisor and avoid getting information from the su-\npervisor. He should learn and collect many information\nrelated to his work. He should deﬁnitely avoid embar-\nrassing the supervisor and senior researchers by asking\ndoubts often. A good supervisor or a senior researcher\ndoes not provide answers to your questions but gives ap-\npropriate directions to clarify your doubts.\nDuring the course of research, one should focus the\nmind mainly on the research work. Don’t allow the\npersonal life to interfere with research. Diversions to\nother activities should be avoided. Further, after work-\ning about say three years and when the time has came\nto consolidate the work done so far a researcher should\nnot start to work on an entirely new topic. He can com-\nplete his thesis work and then work on new topic of his\ninterest. The woman Nobel Laureaute Maria Goeppert\nMayer said,“If you love science, all you really want is to\nkeep on working.”\nA researcher must be clear in his thoughts. He should\nknow what he has to ﬁnd out. In order to perform the\nwork successfully the researcher should acquire proper\ntraining in the techniques of research. The training\nequips the researcher with the requirements of the task.\nFurther, he should be clear about his task and possess\nintellectual insight. Then only he is able to ﬁnd out the\nfacts that would help him in his task. Make your research\na part of your every day life. Think about your research\nwork in background mode, ideas will come out even when\nyou are seeing a movie, traveling to a place, sight-seeing\nand shopping. Ted Gottfried the author of biography of\nFermi said, “Scientiﬁc research is like sports. To score,\nthe focus of the scientist must be narrow and intense to\nthe exclusion of everything else around him. The bat-\nter never takes his eye oﬀ the ball, the hoopster shuts\nout everything but the court, the golfer always follows\nthrough–and the scientist focuses his complete attention\non the task at hand and nothing else.”A young researcher should also have persistence, toler-\nance and self-control over the unpleasant outcomes such\nas not getting an expected result, not recognized by the\nsupervisor and rejection of a research article from a jour-\nnal. “ Don’t get dejected when your paper is rejected ”–\nProf.P.R. Subramanian. Some times one may complete a\npiece of work within a week which he might have expected\nto ﬁnish it in a month time. On the other hand, at some\ntimes one may get stuck with a particular part of the\nwork and unable to make a substantial progress, say, in\nthree months. Avoid feeling remorseful at these circum-\nstances and maintain a high tolerance for poor results.\nRemember that failure and wasted works are also part\nof the research career. Young researchers should create\ngood relationship with their seniors and colleagues.\nC.Getting Joy in Doing Research\nTo get a deep insight on the topic or the research prob-\nlem a suggestion from Dr K.P.N. Murthy is that one\nshould enjoy doing research and approach it as an en-\ntertainment and a mode of getting happiness . In the re-\nsearch career one should treat doing research as a way of\nlife and not just a job. In order to achieve a goal in the\nresearch one has to work harder. The harder one works\nthe happier one feels. One need not try to conquer the\nworld of science. One has to come in order to work and\nto ﬁnd his way. Initially one must work hard. Getting\ninsise a research topic or a research career is like a push-\ning a door. It is hard to push the door open. But when\none understand it it is ver interesting and joyful.\nChandrasekhar pointed out that in the arts and liter-\nature quality of work improves with age and experience\nwhile in science generally it does not. He felt that it is\nbecause of doing science in isolation, very narrow focus\non immediate goals and insuﬃcient broad in interests and\npursuits. In order to continue research even at old age\none should develop the spirit of experiencing the beauty\nof science. The spirit of experiencing it is not restricted\nto only the great scientists. Chandrasekhar said, “This is\nno more than the joys of creativity are restricted to a for-\ntunate few. They are instead accessible to each one of us\nprovided we are attuned to the perspective of strangeness\nin the proportion and conformity of the parts of one an-\nother and to the whole. And there is satisfaction also be\ngained from harmoniously organizing the domain of the\nscience with order, pattern and coherence.”\nProfessor G.Baskaran stressed that group discussion is\nindeed an important component of doing research partic-\nularly in small and isolated institutions. He said, “One\ncannot explain the power and usefulness of group discus-\nsions – it has to be experienced. When I was a student\nat the Indian Institute of Science (I.I.Sc.), Bangalore, a\nfew of us students of physics from I.I.Sc. and National\nAeronautic Laboratory were introduced to this joyous\n12\nexperience by S.K.Rangarajan, formerly a Professor of\nchemistry, in whose house we assembled virtually every\nevening to discuss such grave issues as amorphous solids\nand renormalization group. Each one of the discussants\nhas made a mark” (Current Science, 75(1998)pp.1262).\nFor a discussion on emotional factors see, for example,\nref.[5].\nD.Crucial Stage of Ph.D\nThe crucial period for a research scholar doing full-time\nPh.D. is the last year of the programme. During this pe-\nriod one should concentrate on completing the ﬁnal work\nfor his thesis and writing of various chapters. Generally,\na research fellowship is for ﬁxed period of time, it might\nhave ended before the ﬁnal year of the Ph.D. programme.\nWe have noticed many scholars converted the full-time\nprogramme into part-time and joined in a job. If the job\nis a permanent one then one can join in the job and con-\ntinue the research. But joining in a temporary position\nmay highly change his research career. This would delay\nthe submission of his Ph.D. thesis and he may loose the\ninterest in research. There are examples with students\ncapable of getting a post doctoral fellowship but failed\nto even continuing the research. Therefore, a research\nscholar should have a clear plan of what he has to do in\nthe next few years or so. Even if the fellowship is not\navailable at the ﬁnishing stage of Ph.D. thesis we have\nfriends and our well wishers to give ﬁnancial support to\nsome extend.\nXI. ACTUAL INVESTIGATION\nOne should aim at doing good research. What is good\nresearch? Which universities and research institutions in\nyour country do the best research? How do you distin-\nguish the great from a good, a black hole from an or-\ndinary hole, a superconductor from a normal conductor,\nsupernova from mere stars, poles from ordinary points,\nlinear diﬀerential equations from nonlinear ones?\nTo distinguish one from another we can use various\nquantities. Like wise, to identify the best from among the\navailable, one can use various quantities to measure the\nquality of them. For example, to identify a best research\nthe quality of the one’s research publications, number of\ncitations of his publications, projects completed, books\npublished, contribution made to the science and society,\netc. can be considered.\nResearch work\n(1) published in reputed international journals,\n(2) cited by other researchers working in the same or\nsimilar topic and(3) which added new information to the existing knowl-\nedge on a topic\nare generally considered as good.\nAt the beginning of research career a young researcher\nshould aim to produce a good research, particularly, his\nresearch ﬁndings should distinguish him from other re-\nsearchers and keep him one among the top young re-\nsearchers in the nation. In order to encourage young\nresearchers and motivate them to produce high quality\nof research work awards are given yearly by certain aca-\ndemic and research bodies in each country. For exam-\nple, in India, Indian President Award, Indian National\nScience Academy (INSA) Young Scientist Award and\nmany other awards are given every year. Some Confer-\nence/Seminar organizers also provide best papers award\nto young scientists.\nA.What are the Points to be Kept in\nMind in Order to do a Good Research?\nActual investigation should lead to original contribu-\ntionand not involve objectionable duplication. Original-\nity is the basic credit point of any research. Therefore,\nactual investigation must be directed towards obtaining\nnovel results . A researcher should develop new ideas and\nobtain deep insight into the problem in order to get novel\nand new results which are the characteristics of a good\nresearch.\nTrivial analysis should not be performed. Recently in-\ntroduced theories, experimental techniques and numeri-\ncal algorithms have to be used instead of outdated meth-\nods. Before applying any method, the researcher should\nfamiliarize with the features of the method. It it not\nworthwhile to continue in a particular direction if the re-\nsults are trivial and less informative. If similar problems\nhave already been done, for instance about ten years ago,\nthen a researcher should not consider it as important but\ncould treat it as a useful exercise.\nWe do research by conceiving information and open-\nings from important research papers published by other\nresearchers in the topic of interest and continue in our\nown directions. The work of some other researchers\nmight have formed the basis of our research. Similarly,\nour research outcomes should help other researchers.\nThat is, the work should be such that it should invite\nothers to read and more importantly use it and cite it in\ntheir research work. Our work should lead to recognition\nand respect. It should fetch joy and beneﬁts others and\nas well as us.\nAs pointed out by Professor M.Lakshmanan, generally,\neach and every work of us may not produce novelty, but\nif we work towards novelty then deﬁnitely in the course\n13\nof research there would come a fascinating and exciting\nbreakthrough .\nThe researcher must remember that ideally in the\ncourse of a research study, there should be constant inter-\naction between initial hypothesis, observation and theo-\nretical concepts. It is exactly in this area of interaction\nbetween theoretical orientation and observation that op-\nportunities for originality and creativity lie.\nActual work ﬁnally leads to results and conclusions of\nthe research undertaken. For proper results it is neces-\nsary that various steps of the work should be scientiﬁcally\ntaken and should not have any ﬂaw. Developed computer\nalgorithms must be tested for the problems for which re-\nsults are already available. The work should be free from\nmistakes. Important analysis must be repeated in order\nto make sure that they are free from human mistakes.\nProfessor Devanathan suggests that a researcher should\ncheck, recheck, cross check, ... all the results before sub-\nmitting a research paper to a journal . Before beginning\nto write a part of the work done and the results obtained\ncheck and recheck the data and the results by repeat-\ning the experiment, rerunning the programs and going\nthrough the theoretical derivations and arguments.\nWhen analysing the data, appropriate statistical tools\nhave to be employed. The number of data used, units\nof the data, error bars and other necessary details must\nbe noted in the graphs. As many statistical tools as pos-\nsible should be used. Appropriate curve ﬁtting can be\ndone. Necessary interpretations on the results of statis-\ntical analysis have to be made.\nIn the case of development or modiﬁcation of a theory\nand proposal of a new method the assumptions made,\nbasic idea, and calculations should be clearly stated and\nanalyzed. Various special cases of the theory or method\nmust be identiﬁed. The validity, eﬃciency and applica-\nbility of it must be demonstrated with examples. Merits\nand demerits have to be identiﬁed. Comparison of the\nproposed method with the already existing and widely\nused similar methods should be performed.\nIn any experimental work, mere measurement of cer-\ntain quantities is not enough. The interpretation of the\nkind of data observed and explanation for the particular\npattern must be made. On the basis of interpretation\ngeneral principles underlying the process can be formu-\nlated. One has to check whether the generalizations are\nuniversal and true under diﬀerent conditions.\nSome common errors made in research are [6]\n(1) Selective observation\n(2) Inaccurate observation\n(3) Over-generalization\n(4) Made-up information(5) Ex post facto hypothesizing\n(6) Illogical reasoning\n(7) Ego involvement in understanding\n(8) Premature closure of inquiry\n(9) Mystiﬁcation\nFor a very interesting discussion on the above aspects\nwith examples refer to the ref.[6]\nXII. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION\nThe next step after performing the actual research\nwork on the chosen problem is preparation of results and\nconclusion of the performed work. Predictions, results\nand conclusion are ultimate goals of the research per-\nformed.\nThere are two indispensable rules of modern research.\nThe freedom of creative imagination necessarily sub-\njected to rigorous experimentation. In the beginning any\nexperimental research on a speciﬁc subject, imagination\nshould give wings to the thought. At the time of conclud-\ning and interpreting the facts that were collected observa-\ntion, the imagination should be dominated and prevailed\nover by concrete results of experiments.\nProper interpretations of the results must be made. In-\nterpretation refers to the task of drawing inferences from\nthe actual research work . It also means drawing of con-\nclusion. Conclusion is based on the study performed.\nIt would bring out relations and processes that underlie\nthe ﬁndings. The utility of the outcome of the research\ngreatly lie on proper interpretations and is the hardest\npart of solving a scientiﬁc problem. Interpretation of re-\nsults is important because it\n(1) links the present work to the previous,\n(2) leads to identiﬁcation of future problems,\n(3) opens new avenues of intellectual adventure and\nstimulates the quest for more knowledge,\n(4) makes others understand the signiﬁcance of the re-\nsearch ﬁndings and\n(5) often suggests a possible experimental veriﬁcation.\nThe basic rule in preparing results and conclusion is to\ngive all the evidences relevant to the research problem\nand its solution. A bare statement of the ﬁndings are not\nenough. Their implications must be pointed out. Discuss\nyour answers to the following questions with experts:\n(1) Are the supporting evidences suﬃcient?, and if not,\nWhat to do?\n14\n(2) How many pieces of evidence are required? Instead\nof producing all, is it possible to restrict to one or\ntwo pieces of evidence? If so, what are they? and\n(3) Why are they suﬃcient?\nand so on. Such directions can help us minimize work and\nthe quantity of presentation of the report. Do not rely\non a bogus evidence which would increase the chances of\nerrors. The investigator has to give suggestions. These\nshould be practical and based on logic, reasoning and\nfact. The suggestions should be such that they can be\nactually implemented.\nThe researcher should not be in hurry while preparing\nthe results and conclusion. After preparing them the\nresearcher may ask the following questions:\n(1) Are the quantitative and qualitative analysis per-\nformed adequate for the conclusion drawn?\n(2) Are the results and conclusion general ?\n(3) Are the results and conclusion valid only for the\nparticular situation considered in the present work?\n(4) Is the conclusion too broad considering the analysis\nperformed?\n(5) Is any evidence which weaken the conclusion omit-\nted?\nThe results and conclusion prepared can be revised based\non the answers to the above questions.\nEach and every statement made in the results and con-\nclusion sections must be based on evidence obtained from\ntheoretical or experimental analysis. Baseless statement s\nshould never be made.\nAssignment:\n(9) For each of the following topics write at least two\nquestions, the answers to which must be available\nin the respective topics. For example, for the topic,\n“introduction ”, a relevant question is ‘why am I\ndoing it?’.\n(i) Introduction, (ii) Review of a research topic,\n(iii) Methodology, (iv) Research design, (v) Re-\nsults, (vi) Discussion and (vii) Conclusion.\nXIII. PRESENTING A SCIENTIFIC\nSEMINAR-ORAL REPORT\nA.What is an Oral Report?\nWhat are the Importance of an Oral\nReport?\nPresentation of one’s research work in a scientiﬁc meet-\ning is an oral report . Scientiﬁc meetings include con-\nference, seminar, symposium, workshop, departmental\nweekly seminar, etc.Researchers in certain research institutions not only\ndiscuss their own work but also have discussions on very\nrecently reported work of other scientists.\nAn oral report provides a bridge between the researcher\nand audience and oﬀers greater scope to the researcher\nfor explaining the actual work performed, its outcome\nand signiﬁcance. It also leads to a better understand-\ning of the ﬁndings and their implications. In an oral\nreport, the researcher can present the results and inter-\npretations which are not clearly understood by him and\nmay request the experts in the audience to give their\nopinions and suggestions. Oral reporting at a conference\nor a seminar requires more elaborate preparation than\nthe written report.\nA Nobel prize winner Paul Dirac said, “ A person ﬁrst\ngets a new idea and he wonders very much whether this\nidea will be right or wrong. He is very anxious about it,\nand any feature in the new idea which diﬀers from the old\nestablished ideas is a source of anxiety to him. Whereas\nsome one else who hears about this work and talks it up\ndoesn’t have this anxiety, an anxiety to preserve the cor-\nrectness of the basic idea at all costs, and without having\nthis anxiety he is not so disturbed by the contradiction\nand is able to face up to it and see what it really means.”\nB.Points to be Remembered in\nPreparing an Oral Report\nBefore starting the preparation of an oral report, an\noutline can be drawn based on the time duration of the\nreport and the quality of the audience. Departmental\nseminar is usually 45 minutes duration. In other meet-\nings time duration is ﬁxed by the organizer based on the\nnumber of days of the meeting, number of speakers and\nthe status of a speaker.\nFor a long time report, that is, 45–60 minute presen-\ntation, one may have enough time to\n(1) introduce the topic,\n(2) discuss the deﬁnition of the problem,\n(3) describe the method and technique employed,\n(4) give technical details, and\n(5) present results and conclusion.\nConsequently, these aspects can be prepared in detail.\nFor a 15–30 minute, oral presentation one cannot ﬁnd\nenough time to discuss complete details of the work.\nIn this case less informative material must be dropped.\nMethods and techniques used can be presented very\nbrieﬂy without going into technical details. Much time\nshould be reserved for results, conclusion and further di-\nrections.\n15\nPrepare a write-up of the oral presentation. It is a\ngood and very helpful practice to write the talk before\npresenting it orally. Then evaluate the written material.\nAsk:\n(1)Why should the audience listen to your presenta-\ntion?\n(2)Is the presentation match with the standard of the\naudience?\nRevise the presentation until you get convincing answer\nto the above two questions.\nOral presentation can be made eﬀective and attractive\nby using modern visual devises, power-points, slides and\ntransparency sheets. Title of the report, author’s name,\nplan of the presentation, very important content of it and\nconclusion can be printed in the slides or sheets possibly\npoint by point with bold and suﬃciently large size let-\nters. Important formulas, equations, tables, ﬁgures and\nphotographs can be prepared using transparency sheets\nor slides. Slides and transparency sheets should not con-\ntain running matters. Researcher should not simply read\nthe content in the sheets . That is, the descriptive por-\ntion of the report should not be prepared on the sheets.\nAn abstract or a short write-up of the presentation may\nbe circulated to the participants of the meeting. So-\nphisticated softwares developed for preparing the text on\ntransparency sheets/slides are available in internet and\ncan be freely downloaded. In order to make the presen-\ntation, more lively, the researcher could use multimedia.\nNowadays, the use of power-point of Microsoft Windows\nis common. It is an easy and compact utility software es-\npecially for preparing classroom presentations. The fol-\nlowing are the web sites from which one could download\nthe software at free of cost:\nhttp://www.oﬃce.microsoft.com/downloads\nhttp://www.lb.com/download-free-power-point-\npresentation.org\nOne could use the audio aspects also to facilitate his\npresentation in a better way. While presenting the topic,\nthe researcher should strictly follow the class room teach-\ning methodology. For example, one should allow interac-\ntion; don’t restrict the vision of the audience of a partic-\nular section, don’t forget to modulate the voice as and\nwhen required and don’t violate the time frame.\nOne or two rehearsals of the report in the presence of\ncolleagues, supervisor and collaborators can be exercised\nin order to\n(1) complete the presentation within the allotted time,\n(2) improve the quality of presentation and\n(3) maintain the ﬂuency of the presentation.\nDuring a long presentation, the speaker can stop the pre-\nsentation at various stages, seek comments and questionsfrom the audience and then proceed. This will make the\npresentation attractive, interesting and also allow the au -\ndience to clarify their doubts so that they can follow the\nwork.\nXIV. ART OF WRITING A RESEARCH PAPER\nAND THESIS\nA.What is a Research Report?\nResearch reporting is an oral or a written presenta-\ntion of important and useful aspects of the research work\ndone. Scientiﬁc writing, a thesis or a paper, is intended\nto present clearly the purpose and outcome of a speciﬁc\nresearch investigation. It is the last but a major part\nof the research study. A report helps the researcher get\nfeedback from other researchers and experts working in\nthe same ﬁeld. It also evaluates the success and original-\nity of the researcher’s work. Without a report, a research\nstudy is incomplete and of no use . A report essentially\nconveys the outcome of a research work to interested per-\nsons. Brilliant work and most striking ﬁndings are of\nlittle value if they are not eﬀectively communicated to\nthe scientiﬁc world. As pointed out by Eli Maor, in aca-\ndemic matters the iron rule is publish or perish . Some\ntimes delaying a publication of a result one would lose\nhis claim.\nB.What are Research Paper or Article\nand Ph.D Thesis or Dissertation?\nA research paper is a report published in a journal\nor magazine or conference proceedings, etc. Whereas a\nPh.D. dissertation is a report of the entire work done\nby a researcher to a university or an institution for the\naward of the degree of doctor of philosophy. A Ph.D.\ndissertation is a lengthy, original and substantial docu-\nment. It should contain original contributions. Essen-\ntially, the role of a Ph.D. dissertation is to demonstrate\nthe research person’s original thinking and contribution\nto the topic of research . It should also clearly point out\nthe research competence of the researcher in his research\nﬁeld. M.Phil. dissertation is designed as a practice for\nPh.D. thesis. It will help the researcher learn and un-\nderstand the present status of the topic and make him\ncapable of working at the Ph.D. level. The work done\nfor an M.Phil. dissertation need not be publishable in\njournals.\nC.Why Should a Researcher Report\nhis Findings?\nEvery research investigation is carried out with cer-\ntain objectives . The outcome of a research work may\n16\nadd new information to a theory or may have technolog-\nical applications. Sometimes the researcher may not be\naware of the theoretical development on practical appli-\ncations. His research results may be useful to another\nresearch problem. Some other researchers may be work-\ning or planning to work on the same or similar type of\nresearch work. Several researchers doing same research\nwork is a waste of time unless the solution of the problem\nis needed very urgently and is of great use. Repetition of\na work should be avoided by the research community as\nmuch as possible. Unless a researcher reports his work\nto the world, the correctness, validity and originality of\nthe work is under a question mark. The outcome of a\nresearch work will become known to the scientiﬁc com-\nmunity only through publications. In view of these, it\nis important to report a work in an appropriate jour-\nnal or magazine and in scientiﬁc meetings like confer-\nences, seminars and symposia. Identify possible publica-\ntions of your research ﬁndings after making a consider-\nable progress on a research problem. Don’t be conﬁned\nwith a mere Ph.D. degree.\nD.Characteristics of a Good Report\nA good report results from slow, pain taking and ac-\ncurate inductive work. To attract a reader, the reading\nmatter of a report should be clear and interesting. It\nshould not be obscure and dull. The write-up should be\nlogical, clear and concise. The basic quality or charac-\nteristics of a good scientiﬁc report/paper and thesis are\nthe following:\n(1) good presentation\n(2) good organization of various chapters/sections\n(3) accuracy\n(4) clarity\n(5) free from contradictions and confusion.\nFurther, a Ph.D. dissertation should be a formal and\nshould have high level of scholarship.\nXV. OUTLINE OF A REPORT\nWhat are the considerations to be kept in\nmind while preparing a report?\n(1) First, an outline of a report has to be prepared.\n(2) A sketch of what information to be conveyed must\nbe made.\n(3) Then, one can write down various topics, subtopics\nto be considered and what material to be presented\nin them.(4) The sentences which are to be expanded, reworded\nand veriﬁed for its validity can be marked.\nThe outline of the report helps us concentrate on\n(i) what is to be presented,\n(ii) logical relationships between diﬀerent parts of the\nreport,\n(iii) smooth ﬂow of the content and\n(iv) continuity in the presentation.\nThe outline can be discussed with the guide, collabora-\ntors, colleagues and experts in local area. Based on their\ncomments the structure of the report can be modiﬁed.\nA three stage preparation of a report is generally done\nby researchers. They are\n(1) First draft – Rough draft .\n(2) Second draft – Rewriting and polishing of the rough\ndraft.\n(3) Third draft – Writing the ﬁnal draft .\nA.First Draft\nIn this stage a researcher can write\n(1) what has been done in the research study,\n(2) procedure, method, theory and technique applied,\n(3) technical diﬃculties faced and how they are over-\ncome,\n(4) broad ﬁndings and\n(5) concluding remarks.\nTables and charts can be typeset using computer and\nkept separately in order to avoid rewriting them. Con-\nclusion should be precise, clear and objective. Further\ndirections may be pointed out.\nSince a research paper is identiﬁed by its title it should\nbe brief and not more than above 10-15 words. A sub-\nject index of a paper is primarily based on the words in\nthe title. Therefore, few key words which are helpful to\nclassify the paper can be included appropriately in the\ntitle.\nHow does a reader decide whether to read the con-\ntent of a paper or not? Abstract serves the purpose. By\nreading the abstract a reader would decide whether the\ncontent of the paper is useful to him. Therefore, the\nabstract should have positive information about the con-\ntent of the paper and summary of the work reported in\nit. Further, if the abstract has ﬁnal results and main\nconclusion of the paper then a reader who has a general\ninterest in the subject can know the outcome of the paper\nwithout reading the entire text by referring the abstract\nitself.\n17\nB.Second Draft\nThis is the most important and diﬃcult part of the\nwriting. Extreme care must be taken in writing this\ndraft. Unclear points, jargons, weakness of the report\nhave to be identiﬁed and revised. Over-generalization\nof outcomes should be avoided. For example, Hermi-\ntian operators have real eigenvalues. Generalizing it as\neigenvalues of operators are real or concluding that to\nhave real eigenvalues, operators should be Hermitian are\nincorrect. Similarly, complex analytic functions satisfy\nCauchy–Riemann conditions. It doest not mean that\nfunctions satisfying Cauchy–Riemann conditions should\nbe analytic. How do you avoid over-generalization? For\nsome details see, for example, ref.[5].\nAttention must be paid to the arguments made, logi-\ncal ﬂow of work presented, the quality of supporting evi-\ndences and conclusion drawn. Do these in each chapter.\nDon’t do the entire second stage at a single stretch. Give\nsuﬃcient time between revisions of two consecutive chap-\nters. During the break time think over the revision made\nin the previous chapter or section.\nMore importantly, grammar must be checked. A care-\nful spell check must be made. Use simple words as far\nas possible. Indecisive words such as perhaps, somewhat,\nrather, etc. should be avoided. Usage of some particu-\nlar words repeatedly, for example, ‘very’, ‘extraordinary ’,\n‘invariably’ should be avoided. Expressions such as ‘it\nseems’, ‘there may be’, ‘since’, ‘putting’, etc. should be\nreplaced by appropriate equivalent words.\nStyle, presentation and grammar can be improved by\nasking your friends, colleagues to read and give their crit-\nical comments, suggestions and correct English grammar.\nIn some universities the report is ﬁrst read by an En-\nglish teacher. He corrects the grammar and give sugges-\ntions. After this only a researcher can submit the thesis.\nComplicated and lengthy sentences have to be rewrit-\nten and broken. Similar sentences or sentences conveying\nsame information must be eliminated. Check whether the\nwords used clearly convey exactly the meaning intended.\nS. Chandrasekhar said, “ I always sought to present my\nﬁndings in as elegant, even literary, a form as possible. I\nselect some writers in order to learn. For example, I read\nHenry James or Virginia Woolf, and I don’t simply read\nthe text as a novel; I see how they construct sentences,\nhow they construct paragraphs, how one paragraph goes\ninto another and so on. ” (J. Horgan, Current Science,\n67 (1994) pp.500-01).\nProper references of related work should be included.\nTrivial matters and obvious conclusion should not be in-\ncluded and if there are such sentences then they should\nbe dropped.C.Third Draft\nThis is the last stage. In this stage, one can concen-\ntrate on ﬁnal touches and ﬁnishing . This should be in\nthe direction of making the report weighty, authorita-\ntive, attractive and convincing. Similar words and for-\nmat should be avoided in successive sentences. Make sure\nthat the script clearly shows the originality of the author\nand importance of the outcome of the study performed.\nIn all the three stages of report preparation one should\nfollow a proper style of writing. Use clear and unadorned\nEnglish appropriate for the readers. One has to be aware\nof to whom the research report is intended. The report\nis not for the supervisor. It is better to avoid the use of\npersonal pronoun. Use of “I” and “the author” should be\navoided. Some supervisors like to use “we”. For an inter-\nesting fun about the usage of “I” and “we” see p.106 of\n“Why are things the way they are?” by G. Venkataraman\n(University Press, Hyderabad, 1992).\nBoth active and passive voice should be used wherever\nnecessary or appropriate. However, when using them one\nshould check whether the meaning is strictly correct. For\nexample, when writing “The experimental results agree\nwith the theory” we must check whether we are strength-\nening the experimental result or the theory. Care must\nbe taken in using present and past tenses. Use past tense\nto describe the data collection and work done by others\nand you. For interpretation, assessments and discussions\npresent tense is appropriate.\nBetween various stages it is advisable to give gap of\nfew days so that one can leisurely think of the manuscript\nand record how to revise it. This will avoid unnecessary\ntension and half-hearted write up.\nXVI. LAYOUT OF A RESEARCH REPORT /\nPH.D. THESIS / M.PHIL. DISSERTATION\nThe layout of a research report is the list of various\nparts of the report/thesis. Generally, a research report\nshould consist of the following three components:\n(1) Preliminary pages\n(2) Main text\n(3) End matters\nA. Preliminary Pages\nPreliminary pages include title of the report, acknowl-\nedgement, certiﬁcate page, list of publications and table o f\ncontents . Acknowledgements are written to thank those\nwho have helped the researcher during their course of in-\nvestigation. For a book it is in the form of preface or for-\nward. Acknowledgement should be brief, simple, modest\n18\nand given only to substantial assistance provided by the\nguide, head of the department, staﬀ of the department,\nagencies which provided ﬁnancial support, collaborators\nand institutions where part of the work has been carried\nout. Acknowledgements made for routine participation\nby members of the researcher’s family, librarian, friends,\nclerical helpers and god are normally considered super-\nﬂuous. Acknowledgement should be made at the time of\npublic viva-voce also. There is a chance for a researcher\nto forget to say acknowledgement at the end of the pre-\nsentation. To avoid this he may do it at the beginning of\nthe presentation. An important point is to consider the\ntone to adopt so that you sound genuine.\nEvery research report should have an abstract . It is a\nnecessary part of any scientiﬁc and nonscientiﬁc research\nreport. In a research article it appears next to the au-\nthor’s name and aﬃliation. In the case of Ph.D. thesis,\nbefore its submission an elaborated abstract of the the-\nsis called synopsis has to be submitted to the institution\nwhere registration for Ph.D. degree is made. Abstract\nand synopsis convey the essence and brief details about\nthe report. It should contain a very short statement of\nthe problem, methodology and procedures adapted in the\nwork and results of the study in a very condensed form.\nThe abstract can act as a tool to control the ﬂow of ideas\nin the thesis . It can help you link in a logical way the\nreasons for the research and aims of the work. It should\ncontain answers to the questions: What was done in the\nproject? Why is it of interest? How was it done? What\nwere the outcomes of the work done? What is the signif-\nicance of the results? One should emphasize the original\ncontribution in the abstract. The abstract of a Ph.D.\nthesis will be about three or four pages.\nTable of contents gives title of the chapters, section\nheadings, title of appendices and their page numbers . In\nthe certiﬁcate page the researcher should undertake that\nthe work reported has not been reported earlier by him\nor by any one else for the award of any degree. It should\nalso mention that the work is done by the researcher and\nnot copied from any other source.\nAll the preliminary pages should be numbered with\nlower-case roman numbers.\nB. Main Text\nThe main text presents the details of the research work\nand results. This part of the thesis should provide the\nfollowing, about the research work:\n(1) Introduction\n(2) Actual research work performed and the ﬁndings\n(3) Summary and conclusion.1.Introduction\nThe purpose of the introduction is to give a brief out-\nline of the ﬁeld of research. In this part one can bring\nclearly the importance of the ﬁeld and the current status\nof it. It should contain an overview of the problem, its\nimportance, statements about the hypothesis or speciﬁc\nquestions to be explored. This is followed by a preview\nof the scheme of the following chapters, that is an out-\nline of plan of the work. Here, aim of each of the chap-\nters and their contents can be brieﬂy stated. Related\nand relevant work done by others must be pointed out.\nVarious concepts and deﬁnitions of scientiﬁc and techni-\ncal terms necessary for understanding the research work\nundertaken are to be deﬁned and explained. Details of\nstatistical tools or quantities used in the study can be\ngiven in a separate chapter.\nIrrelevant and less informative materials need not be\npresented. For example, regular and irregular behaviour\nof solution of a system or diﬀerential equation can be\ncharacterized by calculating the statistical tools such as\nLyapunov exponents, correlation function, correlation di -\nmension, power spectrum, periodicity of the solution and\nprobability distribution. If the power spectrum is not\nused in a research work then there is no need to discuss\nin detail the systematic way of calculating it. Similarly,\nsuppose the eﬀect of noise in a theoretical model equation\nis studied by including, say, Gaussian random numbers\nin the simulation. There are many methods available to\ngenerate Gaussian random numbers. If the Box–Muller\nmethod is used then it can be described. In this case de-\nscribing other methods, for example, rejection technique\nis redundant to the present thesis report. The theory\nand experimental set up used should be clearly described\nwith proper references. Deﬁne the technical terms used\nin the dissertation either by a reference to a previously\npublished deﬁnition or by a precise deﬁnition. Such a\ndeﬁnition should be given only once in the report.\nThe introductory chapter(s) should be prepared in\nsuch a way that it should interest the reader in the sub-\nject matter of research. It should not be aimless, confused\nand laking in precision. Introductory part may contain\none or two chapters.\nTo be precise, the introductory part should cover the\nfollowing aspects:\n(1) Features of the topic\n(2) Present status of the ﬁeld\n(3) Some unsolved problems\n(4) Statement of the problem undertaken\n(5) Importance and justiﬁcation of the present problem\n19\n(6) Preview of the scheme of the following chapters and\ntheir interrelationship Deﬁnition of various scien-\ntiﬁc terms used, and\n(7) Methodology used.\n2.Actual Research Work\nThis is the heart of the research report/thesis. The\nactual research work undertaken, diﬃculties faced, tech-\nnical details, results, conclusion and future direction fo rm\nthe main part of this portion. This part can be presented\nin a few chapters. Each chapter should contain introduc-\ntion, research work, results and conclusion. Materials\nshould be organized systematically and presented under\nappropriate headings and subheadings. First, write the\nchapters that describe your actual research work. Af-\nter this, prepare the conclusion and introduction parts.\nWhen writing the actual work collect the terms and note\ndown the matter which are to be deﬁned and described\nin the introduction.\nAs Professor P.R. Subramanian points out, for prepar-\ning the Ph.D. thesis report one should not simply copy\nword by word from his research articles . Even if the con-\ntent of the thesis is the work reported in his research pub-\nlications, the student should reword the material without\nchanging the meaning, give much more details, explana-\ntions, suggestions and possibly a better reorganization of\nthe content.\nWherever possible, the results should be presented in\nthe form of ﬁgures, illustrations and tables. They can\nmake the report quite attractive. Tables should be as\nprecise as possible. All the ﬁgures should clearly specify\nthe variables of the axes, units used and other necessary\ninformation. Figure caption should not be a reproduc-\ntion of sentences of the text. It must clearly state what it\nis. Figures should be clearly explained in the text. Data\nshould be ﬁtted to an appropriate mathematical expres-\nsion. Nowadays, sophisticated softwares are available for\ncurve ﬁtting. After making a curve ﬁt or plotting a set\nof data, proper explanation for observed variation of the\ndata should be given. A set of data measurement without\nany analysis and discussion is of no use.\nExtreme care must be taken in type setting mathemat-\nical equations, variables and parameters involved in the\nstudy. Italic or Greek letters or mathematical symbols\ncan be used for variables and parameters. For example,\nx or X should not be used as a variable name. The correct\nusage is xorX(or typeset in italics). All the equations\nshould be centered and numbered. Vectors should be\nclearly speciﬁed by an arrow over the name or by bold\nface name. Equations should not be repeated.\nJokes or puns should not ﬁnd a place in the re-\nport. Use “correct” or “incorrect” to refer to the resultsof others. Don’t use the words “bad”, “terrible” and\n“stupid”. Avoid use of “today”, “modern times”, “soon”,\n“seems”, “in terms of”, “based on”, “lots of”, “type of”,\n“something like”, “just about”, “number of”, “proba-\nbly”, “obviously”, “along with”, “you”, “I”, “hopefully”\nand “may”. There is no need to mention the circum-\nstances in which the results are obtained.\nAssignment:\n(10) Reword/rephrase the following and give the reason\nfor the change:\n(a) Dinesh and Geethan [1] reported that ...\n(b) The following algorithm represents a major\nbreakthrough ....\n(c) Even though the above method is not earth-\nshaking ....\n(d) Geethan and I obtained ....\n(e) There is a method to calculate ....\n(f) The program will use the data after it stored\nthem to a CD ...\n(g) The method is started by calculating the value\nofδ....\n3.Conclusion\nAt the end of each of chapter, one can place a brief\nsummary of the outcome of the work presented in that\nchapter under the heading conclusion. They should be\nclear and precise.\nThe relevant questions which are still not answered and\nnew questions raised by the work of the present chapter\nhave to be mentioned. Whether the answers to the ques-\ntions are obtained or not, if obtained in which chapter(s)\nthey are presented should be speciﬁed. Mention possible\nfuture research. It is important to make a connection be-\ntween two consecutive chapters either at the end of the\nﬁrst or at the beginning of the second.\nChapters should not look like reports of isolated work.\nThere should be a link between consecutive chapters and\nthe link should be clearly brought out.\nC. End Matters\nThe end part of the report generally consists of refer-\nences, appendices, computer programs (if they are not\neasy to develop) and copies of research publications that\ncame out from the research work done.\n20\n1.Appendices\nAppendices are supplementary contents which are not\nplaced in the main report in order to keep the continuity\nof the discussion; however, they are relevant for under-\nstanding the particular part of the report. An appendix\nmay present\n(1) a brief summary of a theory or a numerical method\nused which can be found elsewhere,\n(2) a lengthy mathematical derivation or a large set of\nequations,\n(3) technical details and\n(4) a list of values of constants and parameters used in\nthe work.\nAppendices can be placed at the end of report after ref-\nerences. They should be numbered by capital alphabets.\n2.References/Bibliography\nReferences or bibliographies are sources consulted.\nEach reference should contain name(s) of author(s), title\nof the paper, journal name, volume number of the issue\nin which the article appeared, starting page number, end\npage number and year of publication. In the case of a\nbook source its author(s), title, publishers’s name, place\nof publication, year of publication and edition should be\ngiven. Some examples are given below.\n(1) Suppose the reference is the paper of K. Murali,\nSudeshna Sinha and W.L. Ditto with title “Imple-\nmentation of NOR gate by a chaotic Chua’s circuit”\nappeared in the journal called ‘International Jour-\nnal of Bifurcations and Chaos’ in the year 2003, the\nvolume number of corresponding issue is 13 and the\nstarting and ending page numbers of the article are\n2669 and 2672 respectively. The above article can\nbe speciﬁed as (without mentioning the title of the\narticle)\nK. Murali, Sudeshna Sinha and W.L. Ditto, Int. J\nBifur. and Chaos 13 (2003) 2669–2672.\n(2) For an article which appeared in a conference pro-\nceedings a typical format is given below:\nR. Harish and K.P.N. Murthy, “Intermittency\nand multifractality in iterated function systems”.\nIn: Nonlinear Systems. Eds. R. Sahadevan\nand M. Lakshmanan (Narosa, New Delhi, 2002)\npp. 361–371.\nIn the above “Intermittency....” is the title of the\nreport of R. Harish and K.P.N. Murthy. “Nonlin-\near Systems” is the title of the conference proceed-\nings edited by R. Sahadevan and M. Lakshmanan.The proceeding was published in the year 2002 by\nNarosa Publishing House, New Delhi. In the pro-\nceedings the article appears from the page 361 to\npage 371.\n(3) A book can be noted down as, for example\nT. Kapitaniak, “Controlling Chaos” (Academic\nPress, San Diego, 1996).\n(4) A Ph.D. thesis can be referred as shown below:\nS. Parthasarathy, “On the analytic structure and\nchaotic dynamics of certain damped driven non-\nlinear oscillators”. Ph.D. thesis. (Bharathidasan\nUniversity, 1993, Unpublished).\n(5) For an unpublished manuscript downloaded from\ninternet one can note down the web site where it is\navailable (see for example the references 5 and 6 of\nthe references section of this manuscript).\nReferences can be either in alphabetical order according\nto author’s name or the order in which they are referred\nin the report. Make sure that each reference cited in\nthe text is correctly entered into the list of references.\nRepetition of references in the list should be avoided.\nD. Typing the Report\nTyping should conform to the set of requirements of\nthe institution. The thesis should be double line spaced\nand not more than 25 lines per page. It may be typed\non both sides. Chapter heading must be in large size\nwith bold face. Each paragraph should be right margin\naligned. Important terms when used ﬁrst time can be\nin italic letters and bold face. First word of a sentence\nshould not be an abbreviation. Latest softwares such as\nLATEX or WORD can be used for thesis, dissertation\nand report preparation. One could download the soft-\nware LATEX a free of cost from the web sites:\n1) http://www.ctan.org\n2) http://www.miktex.org\nIf a report is prepared keeping all the above precau-\ntions in mind, there is every likelihood of it becoming\nuseful for proper study. Such report enables the reader\nto comprehend the data and to determine for himself the\nvalidity of the conclusion.\nBefore or immediately after submitting hard copies of\nthe Ph.D. dissertation to a university, show it to your\ncolleagues, teachers, scientists of your department, your\nparents and friends .\nXVII.

Devanathan\nWhat are the requirements for a successful research ca-\nreer?\nProf. V. Devanathan : Motivation and innate interest in\nthe topic of his research pursuit are the requirements for asuccessful research career. If a person takes the research\nnot by compulsion but by his own choice, then he will\nnot feel it as a burden but pursue it as a hobby. “Science\nis at its best when it is a part of a way of life” - this\nis the inscription that is found on the foundation stone\nof Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai and truly\ndescribes the correct aptitude for a successful research\ncareer.\nIs it possible for an average student to come up with novel\nresults in a research problem? If so, what kind of ap-\nproach he should follow?\nProf. V. Devanathan : Usually, the assessment of a stu-\ndent as good, average or bad is based on his performance\nin the examinations. There are some who are good in\nexaminations with a good memory for reproduction but\nlack in deeper understanding of the subject and original-\nity in approach. There are some who are not so good in\nexaminations but show originality in thinking and follow\nunconventional or novel approach to the subject. There\nare a few who are good both in examinations and re-\nsearch. So, an average student with an ability of average\nperformance in the examinations, need not feel diﬀerent\nif he has originality in thinking andself-conﬁdence .\nDuring a research career, a young researcher may come\nacross disappointing moments like not getting expected\nresults, rejection of a research article from a journal, etc .\nWhat kind of mode of approach a researcher should have\nto face such situations?\nProf. V. Devanathan : “Success begets success and fail-\nure begets failure.” Success and failure are like two sides\nof a coin and one is bound to face them alternatively in\nthe course of one’s research career. Elation at the time of\nsuccess and depression at the time of failure are usually\nmitigated if one works in collaboration with others. At\nthe time of depression, the co-workers come to the rescue\nand prop up the sagging spirit.\nIn our manuscript we have mentioned the following:\nEach and every bit of work has to be done by the re-\nsearcher. A young researcher should not do the entire\nwork in collaboration with others. The researcher is ad-\nvised to perform all the work starting from identiﬁcation\nof the problem to report preparation by himself under the\nguidance of supervisor.\nPlease give your views on this point.\nProf. V. Devanathan : At the initial stages, the re-\nsearcher gets the support of the research group in which\nhe is working and he acquires the knowledge of the group\neﬀortlessly. The weekly informal seminars, if conducted\nwithin the group, will increase the pace of learning and\nhelp to clarify and crystallize the problems. This process\nof learning is made easier if the young researcher works in\ncollaboration with others. This is true both for theoreti-\ncal and experimental work. At present, the experimental\nwork is almost a team work and successful research group\n22\nis one in which the group leader allots the speciﬁed work\nto individuals taking into account his ability and exper-\ntise.\n2. Interview with Dr K.P.N. Murthy\nThe common belief is that research is laborious and\npainful. Many times you have mentioned: “Doing re-\nsearch is an entertainment.” Please, elaborate on this\nstatement of yours.\nDr K.P.N. Murthy : Research not only constitute a dis-\ncovery or creating a new paradise but also consist of ob-\ntaining a personalized understanding of a phenomenon.\nThe struggle that you go through for obtaining an insight\ninto a phenomenon or getting a hold of a nuance and the\nextessy that you get when you get an understanding of\na phenomenon or obtaining a new way of explaining of\nthat phenomenon may be unmatched. This ecstasy is\nnothing to do with what yours creative have impact on\nscience and society. However, it is the ecstasy of what\nEinstein got when he created special theory of relativity\nor Feynman when he created quantum electrodynamics\nor Raman when he found the so-called Raman lines. It\nis this makes the research an enterprise of joy. It is that\nmakes a research an entertainment.\nIs it necessary for a beginner of research to learn all the\naspects of theoretical, experimental and numerical tech-\nniques involved in a topic before he take-up an actual\nresearch problem?\nDr K.P.N. Murthy : A certain basic knowledge about\nphysics and mathematics is must for starting research.\nThat is it. Several things you learn doing research. Igno-\nrance of even some of the basic elements is no hindrance\nfor creativity. What is required for doing good research\nis an enthusiasm, a commitment and willingness to go\nback to basics and learn them right.\nBefore preparing the ﬁnal write-up of your research work,\nyou have the practice of discussing the salient features of\nyour ﬁndings with a few other researchers. How are you\nbeneﬁted from this?\nDr K.P.N. Murthy : After you have completed a piece\nof work I ﬁnd it is a good practice to discuss with your\ncolleagues the important ﬁndings that you have made. I\nhave always realized that I got a better understanding of\nwhat I have done when I tried to explain to my colleagues\nabout my work in a convincing way. The very act of\nspeaking of what you have done removes the cob-webs in\nyour understandings. I always make it to give a seminar\non my work to a larger audience before submitting it to\na journal for publication. I feel this is a very good and\nhelpful practice.\n“Enjoy doing research and approach it as an entertain-\nment and a mode of getting happiness.” This is your sug-\ngestion to young researchers. Please, brief it for the ben-eﬁt of youngsters. In what way will this be helpful to a\nresearcher?\nDr K.P.N. Murthy : In any human enterprise it is impor-\ntant that one likes what one does. The hard work that\nyou have put in a problem does not tired you and rest be\nassured if you approach a research problem with joy and\nyou will get a good result. Publication of that result and\nthe acceptance that you get from your colleagues become\nsecondary. The satisfaction that you obtained by doing a\njob well is a reward by itself. I would say that youngsters\nshould have this attitude towards whatever they do.\n3. Interview with Dr Sudeshna Sinha\nDespite unavoidable tasks a woman of our country has,\nyou have become one of the leading scientists in theo-\nretical physics. What are your advice and suggestions\nto young researchers particularly to young women re-\nsearchers?\nDr Sudeshna Sinha : It is indeed somewhat harder for\nwomen to concentrate on career planning - especially\nwhen their children are young. One will have to accept\nthat household tasks will always be there. The hard-\nest thing is not really the number of hours of work one\ncan put in - but the quality of concentration one can\nachieve. Here discipline comes in. Since women will\nprobably manage to get fewer hours of academic work\ndone every day - they need to really plan the academic\nwork they hope to achieve every single day. So it is most\nbeneﬁcial to discipline oneself into shutting oﬀ all daily\nchores from one’s mind for some hours every day. The\npoint is to learn eﬃciency – and to appreciate that one\ndoes not have the beneﬁt of unlimited time (as others will\nmake justiﬁable demands on your time – like children).\nAlso women may ﬁnd it hard to pursue academic work\nat certain points in their life - but they must preserve the\nself-conﬁdence and will to return to academic after such\ntimes are over. They must realize that in 3–4 decades of\nworking life – a few years is not a big deal. They should\nnot think that a break in career is irreversible .\nPublishing in reputed journals (like Physical Review Let-\nters) is a dream or prestige for many physicists. What\nare the secret of yours for regular publications in reputed\njournals? What type of problems one has to take up for\ngetting published in top-level journals?\nDr Sudeshna Sinha : With journals like Physical Review\nLetters one must remember two things: First, always try\nand make a case of the general interest of your results.\nThe commonest grounds for rejection is lack of broad in-\nterest. This is very subjective of course, and being In-\ndian does not help. But still, at the outset, one should\nmake an attractive statement of the general scope of one’s\nwork (that is, try to answer this hypothetical question:\nWhy should someone not doing research in this exact\nnarrow sub-ﬁeld be interested in reading my paper). Sec-\nond point is persistence. Take all criticisms of the paper\n23\nseriously (and don’t reply needlessly aggressively to the\nreferees) and try to answer all the criticisms. Then re-\nsubmit, and don’t give up till the last round!\nHow could a beginner of research come up with novel re-\nsults?\nDr Sudeshna Sinha : Well, I think coming up with novel\nresults is not entirely in one’s hand. There is an element\nof good fortune here! If the guide of the young researcher\ncan identify a problem that is technically easy to tackle –\nbut whose results can be of considerable potential interest\n– then there is a good chance for the young researcher\nto get a novel result. But this is not in the hands of the\nyoung researcher, and most often not in the hands of the\nguide either (as it depends on the subject, timing etc.).\nIn this matter I always tell my students:\nwhether you get a novel result tomorrow is amatter of luck, but in a career spanning several\ndecades, if you work steadily and think deeply\nabout the subject, it is almost assured that at\nsome point or the other, you will get a good idea\nwhich will lead to a novel result!\nTo get a deep insight into the topic or problem of research,\nwhat are the ways a young researcher can follow?\nDr Sudeshna Sinha : One should not just passively read\npapers or books! One should try to work it all out in\nsome detail. While reading passively one feels one has\nunderstood – but only when one is trying to solve some-\nthing does one gain any real understanding. In fact it is\na great idea to look at the title and abstract of a paper,\nand then ask oneself how one would have attempted to\nwork on such a problem and only then look at what the\nauthors have done.",

(2) research on existing theories and concepts help us identify the range and applications of them. (3) it is the fountain of knowledge and provide guidelines for solving problems. (4) research provides basis for many government policies. for example, research on the needs and desires of the people and on the availability of revenues to meet the needs helps a government to prepare a budget. (5) it is important in industry and business for higher gain and productivity and to improve the quality of products. (6) mathematical and logical research on business and industry optimizes the problems in them. (7) it leads to the identification and characterization of new materials, new living things, new stars, etc. (8) only through research can inventions be made; for example, new and novel phenomena and processes such as superconductivity and cloning have been discovered only through research.(9) social research helps find answers to social problems. they explain social phenomena and seek solution to social problems. (10) research leads to a new style of life and makes it delightful and glorious . emphasizing the importance of research louis pasteur said “i beseech you to take interest in these sacred domains called laboratories. ask that there be more and that they be adorned for these are the temples of the future, wealth and well-being. it is here that humanity will learn to read progress and individual harmony in the works of nature, while humanity’s own works are all too often those of babarism, fanaticism and destruction.” (louis paster – article by s.mahanti, dream 2047, p.29–34 (may 2003)). in order to know what it means to do research one may read scientific autobiographies like richard feynmann’s “surely you are joking, mr.feynmann!”, jim watson’s “the double helix”, “science as a way of life – a biography of c.n.r. rao” by mohan sundararajan, etc. ii. research methods and research methodology is there any difference between research methods and research methodology? research methods are the various procedures, schemes, algorithms, etc. used in research. all the methods used by a researcher during a research study are termed as research methods . they are essentially planned, scientific and value-neutral. they include theoretical procedures, experimental studies, numerical schemes, statistical approaches, etc. research methods help us collect samples, data and find a solution to a problem. particularly, scientific research methods call for explanations based on collected facts, measurements and observations and not on reasoning alone. they accept only those explanations which can be verified by experiments. research methodology is a systematic way to solve a problem. it is a science of studying how research is to be carried out. essentially, the procedures by which researchers go about their work of describing, explaining and predicting phenomena are called research methodology.it is also defined as the study of methods by which knowledge is gained. its aim is to give the work plan of research. a.importance of research methodology 3 in research study it is necessary for a researcher to design a methodology for the problem chosen. one should note that even if the method considered in two problems are same the methodology may be different. it is important for the researcher to know not only the research methods necessary for the research under taken but also the methodology. for example, a researcher not only needs to know how to calculate mean, variance and distribution function for a set of data, how to find a solution of a physical system described by mathematical model, how to determine the roots of algebraic equations and how to apply a particular method but also need to know (i) which is a suitable method for the chosen problem?, (ii) what is the order of accuracy of the result of a method?, (iii) what is the efficiency of the method? and so on. consideration of these aspects constitute a research methodology. to understand the difference between research methods and methodology let us consider the problem of finding the roots of the quadratic equation ax2+bx+c= 0. (1) the formulas often used for calculating the roots of eq.(1) are x+=−b+√ b2−4ac 2a, (2) x−=−b−√ b2−4ac 2a· (3) these formulas are, however, inaccurate when |b| ≈√ b2−4ac. the equivalent formulas are x+=−2c b+√ b2−4ac, (4) x−=−2c b−√ b2−4ac. (5) when |b| ≈√ b2−4acone must proceed with caution to avoid loss of precision. if b >0, then x+should be computed with the formula given by eq.(2) and x−should be computed with the formula given by eq.(3). if b <0 then x+should be evaluated using eq.(4) and x−should be evaluated using eq.(5). here the two formulas constitute the method of finding roots of the equation of the form given by eq.(1). if you use the formulas given by eqs.(4– 5) instead of the formulas given by eqs.(2–3) (often used and familiar to us) to compute the roots then you should clearly explain why the formulas in eqs.(4–5) were chosen and why the other formulas given by eqs.(2–3) were not considered. this is what we mean by a research methodology. that is, research methodology tells you which method or formula or algorithm has to be used out of the various existing methods or formulas or algorithms. more precisely, research methods help us get a solution to a problem. on the other hand, research methodology is concerned with the explanation of the following:(1) why is a particular research study undertaken? (2) how did one formulate a research problem? (3) what types of data were collected? (4) what particular method has been used? (5) why was a particular technique of analysis of data used? the study of research methods gives training to apply them to a problem. the study of research methodology provides us the necessary training in choosing methods, materials, scientific tools and training in techniques relevant for the problem chosen. assignment: (1) list out at least 10 methods which you have learned in your ug and pg courses and write their purpose or application. (2) distinguish between research methods and research techniques. (3) distinguish between research methods and research methodology with an example of your own choice. iii. types of research research is broadly classified into two main classes: 1. fundamental or basic research 2. applied research a.basic research basic research is an investigation on basic principles and reasons for occurrence of a particular event or process or phenomenon. it is also called theoretical research . study or investigation of some natural phenomenon or relating to pure science are termed as basic research . basic researches some times may not lead to immediate use or application. it is not concerned with solving any practical problems of immediate interest. but it is original or basic in character. it provides a systematic and deep insight into a problem and facilitates extraction of scientific and logical explanation and conclusion on it. it helps build new frontiers of knowledge. the outcomes of basic research form the basis for many applied research. researchers working on applied research have to make use of the outcomes of basic research and explore the utility of them. research on improving a theory or a method is also referred as fundamental research. for example, suppose 4 a theory is applicable to a system provided the system satisfies certain specific conditions. modifying the theory to apply it to a general situation is a basic research. attempts to find answers to the following questions actually form basic research. why are materials like that? what they are? how does a crystal melt? why is sound produced when water is heated? why do we feel difficult when walking on seashore? why are birds arrange them in ‘>’ shape when flying in a group? fundamental research leads to a new theory or a new property of matter or even the existence of a new matter, the knowledge of which has not been known or reported earlier. for example, fundamental research on (1) astronomy may lead to identification of new planets or stars in our galaxy, (2) elementary particles results in identification of new particles, (3) complex functions may leads to new patterns or new properties associated with them, (4) differential equations results in new types of solutions or new properties of solutions not known so far. (5) chemical reactions leads to development of new compounds, new properties of chemicals, mechanism of chemicals reactions, etc. (6) medicinal chemistry leads to an understanding of physiological action of various chemicals and drugs. (7) structure, contents and functioning of various parts of human body helps us identify the basis for certain diseases. b.applied research in anapplied research one solves certain problems employing well known and accepted theories and principles. most of the experimental research, case studies and interdisciplinary research are essentially applied research. a pplied research is helpful for basic research. a research, the outcome of which has immediate application is also termed as applied research . such a research is of practical use to current activity. for example, research on social problems have immediate use. applied research is concerned with actual life research such as research on increasing efficiency of a machine, increasing gain factor of production of a material, pollution control, preparing vaccination for a disease, etc. obviously, they have immediate potential applications. some of the differences between basic and applied research are summarized in table 1.1. thus, the centralaim of applied research is to find a solution for a practical problem which warrants solution for immediate use, whereas basic research is directed towards finding information that has broad base of applications and thus add new information to the already existing scientific knowledge. c.quantitative and qualitative methods the basic and applied researches can be quantitative or qualitative or even both. quantitative research is based on the measurement of quantity or amount. here a process is expressed or described in terms of one or more quantities. qualitative research is concerned with qualitative phenomenon involving quality. it is non-numerical, descriptive, applies reasoning and uses words. its aim is to get the meaning, feeling and describe the situation. we measure and weigh things in the study of substance or structure. can we measure or weigh patterns? we cannot measure or weigh patterns. but to study patterns we must map a configuration of relationships. that is, structures involve quantities whereas patterns involv e qualities. if one wishes to investigate why certain data are random then it is a qualitative research. if the aim is to study how random the data is, what is the mean, variance and distribution function then it becomes quantitative. explaining how digestion of food takes place in our body is a qualitative description. it does not involve any numbers or data and quantities. the detection of a particular compound is a qualitative analysis. this can be done by carrying out physical or chemical tests. determination of exact amount of a partable i: differences between basic and applied researches. basic research applied research seeks generalization studies individual or specific cases without the objective to generalize aims at basic processes aims at any variable which makes the desired difference attempts to explain why things happentries to say how things can be changed tries to get all the facts tries to correct the facts which are problematic reports in technical language of the topicreports in common language 5 ticular compound present in a volume is essentially quantitative analysis. this can be done by volumetric, gravimetric and calorimetric methods or instrumental methods. experimental and simulation studies are generally quantitative research. d.other types of research other types of research include action research (fact findings to improve the quality of action in the social world), explanatory research (searching explanations for events and phenomena, for example finding answer to the question why are the things like what they are?), exploratory research (getting more information on a topic) andcomparative research (obtaining similarities and differences between events, methods, techniques, etc.). for discussion on these types of research see refs.[1–3]. assignment: (4) list out at least 10 theoretical and applied methods which you have learned in your ug, pg courses and write their features in two or three sentences. (5) write at least 20 questions in your subject the investigation of which forms basic research. then point out how many of them have already been solved and how many were found in applications. (6) distinguish between theory and experiment. (7) write a note on importance of theory in basic and applied researches. (8) bring out the importance of inter-disciplinary research. iv. various stages of a research whenever a scientific problem is to be solved there are several important steps to follow. the problem must be stated clearly, including any simplifying assumptions. then develop a mathematical statement of the problem. this process may involve use of one or more mathematical procedures. frequently, more advanced text books or review articles will be needed to learn about the techniques and procedures. next, the results have to be interpreted to arrive at a decision. this will require experience and an understanding of the situation in which the problem is embedded. a general set of sequential components of research is the following: 1. selection of a research topic 2. definition of a research problem 3. literature survey and reference collection4. assessment of current status of the topic chosen 5. formulation of hypotheses 6. research design 7. actual investigation 8. data analysis 9. interpretation of result 10. report in the following sections the above mentioned various stages of research are discussed in detail. v. selection of a research topic and problem the starting point of a research is the selection of a research topic and problem. identifying a suitable topic for work is one of the most difficult parts of a research. before choosing a research topic and a problem the young researchers should keep the following points in mind. •topic should be suitable for research. •the researcher should have interest in it. •topic should not be chosen by compulsion from some one else. topic and problem can be fixed in consultation with the research supervisor. in our country often research supervisors suggest a topic and state a problem in broad view. the researcher has to narrow it and define it in operational form. one may ask: is it necessary that the topic of a ph.d. should be different from m.sc. project and m.phil dissertation? the answer is not necessary. if a student is able to get a supervisor working in his m.sc.project or m.phil dissertation topic then it would save about six months in the duration of his ph.d. work. a.can a researcher choose a topic by himself? a youngster interested to start a research career wishes to know whether he/she has freedom to do research in the topic of his/her own interest. the style of research in our country and various other factors like the infrastructure facility available in a research institute, time limit, our commitment to family and social set up hardly allow a young researcher to choose a topic by himself for his pg project, m.phil. dissertation and ph.d. thesis. however, many research supervisors give complete freedom to choose a problem in the topic suggested by him for a ph.d. research work. because the normal time duration of m.phil dissertation is about 6-8 months, it is better to work on the problem suggested by the supervisor. 6 if a student wishes to do research (for ph.d. degree) with fellowship then he cannot have freedom to choose a topic since he has to work on a project the goal of which is already defined by the project investigator. on the other hand, after choosing a topic of his own interest he has to find a supervisor who is working in that topic or interested in guiding him. in this case one has severe limitation in our country for getting a fellowship and for registering for a research degree. if a student is not very much particular about the fellowship he has a chance to do research in the topic of his own interest. a researcher in india after two years of research experience with few (two or more) publications can apply for a senior research fellowship (srf) to csir (council for scientific and industrial research) (for details see its and other relevant web sites). he can prepare a project under the direction of his ph.d. supervisor which can lead to a fellowship. for details see the book ‘how to get scholarships, fellows and stipends’ by k.d.kalaskar (sultan chand and sons, new delhi)) considering the above, a researcher should make-up his mind so as to work in a topic suggested by the supervisor. however, a research problem may be chosen by a researcher himself. this has several advantages. in this case •the researcher can pursue his/her own interest to the farthest limits, •there is an opportunity to spend a long time on something that is a continuous source of his pleasure and •the results would prove better in terms of the growth of the investigator and the quality of the work. if the researcher is not interested in the topic and problem assigned to him but is working on it because of supervisor’s compulsion, then he will not be able to face and overcome the obstacles which come at every stage in research. b.identification of a research topic and problems some sources of identification of a research topic and problems are the following: (1) theory of one’s own interest (2) daily problems (3) technological changes (4) recent trends (5) unexplored areas(6) discussion with experts and research supervisor suppose one is interested in the theory of nonlinear differential equations or quasicrystals or fullerenes. then h e can find a research guide who is working in this field or interested to work in this field and then choose a problem for research. our daily experiences and day to affairs have rich openings on various aspects such as the daunting tasks of aids, air pollution, afforestation and deforestation, chil d labor, problems of aged citizens, etc. technology in various branches of science, business and marketing changes rapidly. for example, in the early years, computers were built in larger size with vacuum tubes. then evolution in electronic technology replaced them by integrated circuits. recently, scientists have developed quantum dots. now the interest is in developing efficient, super-fast and miniaturized computing machine made up of material whose particle size of the order of nano (10−9) meter or even smaller. similarly, another fascinating topic namely, thin film has multiple fields of applications. recent research on fullerenes resulted in many practical applications. choosing a topic of current interest or recent trends provides bright and promising opportunities for young researchers to get post-doctoral fellowship, position in leading institutions in our nation and abroad. in each subject there are several topics which are not explored in detail even though the topic was considered by scientists long time ago. for example, string theory, quantum computing, nano particles, quantum cloning and quantum cryptography and gene immunology are fascinating topics and are in preliminary stages. the supervisors and experts are working on one or few fields over a long time and they are the specialists in the field considered and well versed with the development and current status of the field. therefore, a young researcher can make use of their expertise in knowing various possible problems in the topic the solving of which provide better opportunities in all aspects. don’t choose a topic simply because it is fascinating. in choosing a topic one should take care of the possibility of data collection, quantity of gain, breadth of the topic and so on. the topic should not be too narrow. for example, the study of social status and sexual life of married couples of same sex (man-man marriage and woman-woman marriage) is interesting and of social relevance. but the intricate problem here is that we do not find enough number of such couples to study. this is a very narrow topic at the same time we will not get enough data to analyze. on the other hand, the changes in the social life of aravanis in recent times is a valuable social problem and one can collect enough data. 7 further, one has to study advanced level text books and latest research articles to identify problems. is it necessary to know all the methods, techniques, concepts in a research topic before identifying a problem for investigation? this is not necessary. after learning some fundamental concepts, recent developments and current trends of a topic, one can identify a problem for research. then he can learn the tools necessary to solve it. c.definition and formulation of a problem after identifying a problem, in order to solve it, it has to be defined and formulated properly. for this purpose, one can execute the following. •state the problem in questionnaire form or in an equivalent form •specify the problem in detail and in precise terms •list the assumptions made •remove the ambiguities, if any, in the statement of the problem •examine the feasibility of a particular solution defining the problem is more important than its solution. it is a crucial part of the research study and should not be defined in hurry. d.how do you asses whether the defined problem as a good problem? a problem in its first definition may not be appealing. it may require redefinition in order to make it a good problem. that is, by suitably rewording or reformulating the chosen problem, it can be made to meet the criteria of a good problem. this is also important to solve the problem successfully. to this end a researcher can ask a series of questions on the problem. some are: (1) is the problem really interesting to him and to the scientific community? (2) is the problem significant to the present status of the topic? (3) is there sufficient supervision/guidance? (4) can the problem be solved in the required time frame? (5) are the necessary equipment, adequate library and computational facilities, etc. available? if the answers to these questions are satisfactory, then the researcher can initiate work on the chosen problem. in addition, discuss the problem with the current doctoral students and obtain the scope of the problem and other related aspects.e.how are these questions important and relevant to a researcher? the researcher should be interested on the problem for the reasons mentioned earlier at the end of the sec.(v a). the problem should also be interesting to the supervisor so that the researcher can get the necessary guidance from him. otherwise sometimes the researcher may find it very difficult to convince the supervisor on the importance and significance of the results obtained. more importantly, the problem must be of interest to scientific community and society. if not then the researcher will find great difficulty to publish his findings in reputed journals and convince the funding agency. next, the status of the problem, particularly the importance of finding its solution should match with the current status of the field. but, if the problem investigated is of not much interest to science and society then publications will become useless to him in his research career. specifically, they cannot help earn a post-doctoral fellowship, respectability and a permanent job in an institution. a researcher needs proper guidance and encouragement from the supervisor regularly. this is important for keeping the research in right track, to overcome the difficulties which come at various states of research and also to have moral support. a researcher should avoid working under the guidance of a supervisor having serious health problems or family problems, committed his large time to administrative work and strong involvement in nonacademic matters. another important point is that before initiating research work on a problem, a rough estimate on costs and time required to complete the work must be made. a problem suitable for ph.d. degree should not be taken for m.phil. degree. a problem suitable for m.phil. degree is not appropriate for master’s degree. if the collection of data or resources or related information takes many years, then the topic is obviously inappropriate for ph.d. degree. controversial subjects should not be chosen. problems that are too narrow or too vague should be avoided. finally, the researcher must make sure that the necessary experimental setup and materials to perform the actual research work are available in the department where research work is to be carried out. without these, if the researcher initiated the work and has gone through certain stages of work or spent one or two years in the problem then in order to complete the task he would be forced to buy the materials and instruments from his personal savings. 8 vi. literature survey after defining a problem, the researcher has to do literature survey connected with the problem. literature survey is a collection of research publications, books and other documents related to the defined problem . it is very essential to know whether the defined problem has already been solved, status of the problem, techniques that are useful to investigate the problem and other related details. one can survey (1) the journals which publish abstracts of papers published in various journals, (2) review articles related to the topic chosen, (3) journals which publish research articles, (4) advanced level books on the chosen topic, (5) proceedings of conferences, workshops, etc., (6) reprint/preprint collections available with the supervisor and nearby experts working on the topic chosen and (7) internet. a free e-print service provider for physics, mathematics, nonlinear science, computer science and biology is http://www.arxiv.org no research shall be complete unless we make use of the knowledge available in books, journals and internet. review of the literature in the area of research is a preliminary step before attempting to plan the study. literature survey helps us (1) sharpen the problem, reformulate it or even leads to defining other closely related problems, (2) get proper understanding of the problem chosen, (3) acquire proper theoretical and practical knowledge to investigate the problem, (4) show how the problem under study relates to the previous research studies and (5) know whether the proposed problem had already been solved. through survey one can collect relevant information about the problem. clarity of ideas can be acquired through study of literature. apart from literature directly connected with the problem, the literature that is connected with similar problems is also useful. it helps formulate the problem in a clear-cut way. a review on past work helps us know the outcome of those investigations where similar problems were solved. it can help us design methodology for the present work. we can also explore the vital links with thevarious trends and phases in the chosen topic and familiarize with characteristic precepts, concepts and interpr etations. further, it can help us formulate a satisfactory structure of the research proposal. because a ph.d. thesis or m.phil. dissertation is a study in depth aiming contribution to knowledge, a careful check should be made to ensure that the proposed study has not previously been performed and reported. the earlier studies which are relevant to the problem chosen should be carefully studied. ignorance of prior studies may lead to a researcher duplicating a work already carried out by another researcher. a good library will be of great help to a researcher at this stage. one can visit nearby research institutions and avail the library facilit y. review the latest research papers and ph.d. theses to acquire recent trends. vii. reference collection as soon as the survey of available source begins, the preparation and collection of references preferably with annotations should be undertaken. the important source of reference collection is the journal called current contents. this comes once in a week. it is available in hard copy and also in floppy diskette. almost all the universities and institutions buy this document. it contains the table of content of research journals and magazines in various subjects. it provides title of articles, names of the authors, date of publication, volume number, starting page number of the articles and address of the author from whom one can get the reprint of the article. if the title of the article indicates that the paper is in the topic of one’s interest then he can take a copy of the article if the journal is available in the local library. otherwise, he can get it from a document delivery service centre. for example, in india inflibnet provides this service through six institutions. for details visit the following web sites: http://web.inflibnet.ac.in/index.isp http://www.iisc.ernet.in/ http://www.jnu.ac.in/ one can obtain a research article on paying the charge fixed by the inflibnet provided the particular journal is available in it. articles can also be purchased from the publishers on payment. alternatively, reprint of the article can be had from the author by sending a letter/card to the author. a format of reprint request card is shown below. 9 ————————————————————————front side place: date : dear dr./prof. i would appreciate in receiving a reprint of your following article and other related preprints/reprints, if any. title : journal name : volume number: page(s): year: with kind regards, yours sincerely, ————————————————————————————————————————————————reverse side sender’s address to ————————————————————————the references from current contents or from journals can be noted on a separate card or sheet with the names of authors and the title of the paper/book, etc. for a research paper, its title, journal name, volume number, starting and ending pages of it and year of publication should be noted. for a book, publisher’s name, place of publication and year of publication must be written down. instead of cards, nowadays one can store the details of the references in computers and have a copy in two or three floppy diskette. the references can be classified. for example, sources dealing with theory, dealing with experimental techniques, concerned with numerical methods, etc. can be grouped separately. the copies of the research articles can also be classified and bounded. cross references (that is research articles or books referred or cited in a research report) should also be collected and classified. these also provide useful information. viii. assessing the current status generally, it is not difficult to know the current status of research work in a specific topic. the current status of the chosen topic can be identified by reading the relevant journals and the recent papers, discussions in conferences, seminars and workshops. one can perform inquiries at several important places known for research on proposed topic.a study of the current literature in the chosen topic explores the current status of it. more importantly, review articles point out not only to the basic aspects and features of the topic concerned but also give a brief account of its present status. for this purpose, one can survey the journals (for a topic in physics) such as physics reports, reviews of modern physics, physical review letters, review section of american journal of physics, pramana, current science and proceedings of recently conducted seminars and conferences, etc. rapid communication and letter sections of international journals publish articles which are very important and fall in recent trends category. there are several areas in internet where the papers just submitted to journals are placed. one can download such articles free of cost. these articles indicate the recent trends in a particular topic. some relevant web sites are listed below. http://arxiv.org/ http://www.ams.org/global-preprints/ http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.ag/ http://www.ma.utexas.edu/mp −arc/ http://www.clifford.org/anonftp/clf-alg/ ix. hypothesis researchers do not carry out work without any aim or expectation. research is not of doing something and presenting what is done. every research problem is undertaken aiming at certain outcomes. that is, before starting actual work such as performing an experiment or theoretical calculation or numerical analysis, we expect certain outcomes from the study. the expectations form the hypothesis. hypotheses are scientifically reasonable predictions . they are often stated in terms of if-then sentences in certain logical forms. a hypothesis should provide what we expect to find in the chosen research problem. in other words, the expected or proposed solutions based on available data and tentative explanations constitute the hypothesis. hypothesizing is done only after survey of relevant literature and learning the present status of the field of research. it can be formulated based on previous research and observation. to formulate a hypothesis the researcher should acquire enough knowledge in the topic of research and a reasonably deep insight about the problem. in formulating a hypothesis construct operational definitions of variables in the research problem. hypothesis is due to an intelligent guess or for inspiration which is to be tested in the research work rigorously through appropriate methodology. testing of hypothesis leads to explanation of the associated phenomenon or event. what are the criteria of a good hypothesis? an hy10 pothesis should have conceptual clarity and a theoretical orientation. further, it should be testable. it should be stated in a suitable way so that it can be tested by investigation. a hypothesis made initially may become incorrect when the data obtained are analyzed. in this case it has to be revised. it is important to state the hypothesis of a research problem in a research report. we note that if a hypothesis withstands the experiments and provides the required facts to make it acceptable, not only to the researchers performing the experiments but to others doing other experiments then when sufficiently reinforced by continual verification the hypothesis may become a theory [4]. x. mode of approach mode of approach means the manner in which research is to be carried out. it should keep the researcher on the right track and make him complete the planned work successfully . one should sharpen the thinking and focus attention on the more important aspects of the study. the scientific thinking must be more formal, strict, empirical and specific and more over goal oriented. in order to make steady progress in research and to asses the progress of the research work, a research design is very helpful. a.research design for a scientific research one has to prepare a research design. it should indicate the various approaches to be used in solving the research problem, sources and information related to the problem and, time frame and the cost budget. essentially, the research design creates the foundation of the entire research work. the design will help perform the chosen task easily and in a systematic way. once the research design is completed the actual work can be initiated. the first step in the actual work is to learn the facts pertaining to the problem. particularly, theoretical methods, numerical techniques, experimental techniques and other relevant data and tools necessary for the present study have to be collected and learnt. it is not necessary that every theory, technique and information in the topic of research is useful for a particular problem. a researcher has to identify and select materials which are useful to the present work. further, the validity and utility of the information gathered should be tested before using them. scientific research is based on certain mathematical, numerical and experimental methods. these sources have to be properly studied and judged before applying them to the problem of interest. b.what are the possible approachesto be followed by a researcher? a researcher can exercise the following aspects regularly throughout the research carrier. these will keep him in right track and tightly bind him to the research activity. (1) discussion with the supervisor, experts and colleagues about the research work, particularly, the problem and its origin, objectives and difficulties faced in the execution of the problem. (2) reading of the latest research papers, relevant theories and possible application to the present problem and to overcome the difficulties faced. (3) review of the work reported on the similar problems. (4) theoretical calculations, setting-up of an experimental setup, numerical calculations, computer programs, preparation of graphs, tables and other relevant work related to the research should be done by a new researcher by himself without assistance from others. (5) have a practice of periodically writing the work done, results obtained and steps followed in a work. this is important because sometime we may think that a particular aspect will be a center piece of the problem under investigation. but once we make a write-up of it, this aspect or part of it may turn out to be only of marginal importance. in fact, writing of the progress of the work will help us better understand our work and forms a solid basis for further progress. it also points out to the gaps in our work. (6) participation and presentation of research findings in national and international meetings. these regular practices provide useful information like new ideas and can help the researcher (1) sharpen and focus attention, (2) confining to the formulation and (3) in the interpretation of the solution obtained. each and every bit of task related to the research work has to be done by the researcher. a young researcher should not do the entire work in collaboration with others. the researcher is advised to perform all the works starting from identification of the problem to report preparation by himself under the guidance of supervisor. particularly, collaboration work with experts and senior researcher may be avoided. (however, he can discuss his problems with them). this is important to acquire (1) enough knowledge, 11 (2) confidence and (3) training to carry out research independently after getting ph.d. degree. part of the dissertation should demonstrate the researcher’s originality. the dissertation should reflect the efforts of a single researcher. keeping this in mind one should avoid collaboration as far as possible in the young stage. prof.balaram wrote “there are guides who have no interest in their discipline and leave their wards to their own devices. surprisingly, it is these guides who produce some of the most resilient scientists, self-taught men and women, who develop great confidence in their abilities” [current science 87(2004)1319]. a researcher should provide new information to the supervisor and avoid getting information from the supervisor. he should learn and collect many information related to his work. he should definitely avoid embarrassing the supervisor and senior researchers by asking doubts often. a good supervisor or a senior researcher does not provide answers to your questions but gives appropriate directions to clarify your doubts. during the course of research, one should focus the mind mainly on the research work. don’t allow the personal life to interfere with research. diversions to other activities should be avoided. further, after working about say three years and when the time has came to consolidate the work done so far a researcher should not start to work on an entirely new topic. he can complete his thesis work and then work on new topic of his interest. the woman nobel laureaute maria goeppert mayer said,“if you love science, all you really want is to keep on working.” a researcher must be clear in his thoughts. he should know what he has to find out. in order to perform the work successfully the researcher should acquire proper training in the techniques of research. the training equips the researcher with the requirements of the task. further, he should be clear about his task and possess intellectual insight. then only he is able to find out the facts that would help him in his task. make your research a part of your every day life. think about your research work in background mode, ideas will come out even when you are seeing a movie, traveling to a place, sight-seeing and shopping. ted gottfried the author of biography of fermi said, “scientific research is like sports. to score, the focus of the scientist must be narrow and intense to the exclusion of everything else around him. the batter never takes his eye off the ball, the hoopster shuts out everything but the court, the golfer always follows through–and the scientist focuses his complete attention on the task at hand and nothing else.”a young researcher should also have persistence, tolerance and self-control over the unpleasant outcomes such as not getting an expected result, not recognized by the supervisor and rejection of a research article from a journal. “ don’t get dejected when your paper is rejected ”– prof.p.r. subramanian. some times one may complete a piece of work within a week which he might have expected to finish it in a month time. on the other hand, at some times one may get stuck with a particular part of the work and unable to make a substantial progress, say, in three months. avoid feeling remorseful at these circumstances and maintain a high tolerance for poor results. remember that failure and wasted works are also part of the research career. young researchers should create good relationship with their seniors and colleagues. c.getting joy in doing research to get a deep insight on the topic or the research problem a suggestion from dr k.p.n. murthy is that one should enjoy doing research and approach it as an entertainment and a mode of getting happiness . in the research career one should treat doing research as a way of life and not just a job. in order to achieve a goal in the research one has to work harder. the harder one works the happier one feels. one need not try to conquer the world of science. one has to come in order to work and to find his way. initially one must work hard. getting insise a research topic or a research career is like a pushing a door. it is hard to push the door open. but when one understand it it is ver interesting and joyful. chandrasekhar pointed out that in the arts and literature quality of work improves with age and experience while in science generally it does not. he felt that it is because of doing science in isolation, very narrow focus on immediate goals and insufficient broad in interests and pursuits. in order to continue research even at old age one should develop the spirit of experiencing the beauty of science. the spirit of experiencing it is not restricted to only the great scientists. chandrasekhar said, “this is no more than the joys of creativity are restricted to a fortunate few. they are instead accessible to each one of us provided we are attuned to the perspective of strangeness in the proportion and conformity of the parts of one another and to the whole. and there is satisfaction also be gained from harmoniously organizing the domain of the science with order, pattern and coherence.” professor g.baskaran stressed that group discussion is indeed an important component of doing research particularly in small and isolated institutions. he said, “one cannot explain the power and usefulness of group discussions – it has to be experienced. when i was a student at the indian institute of science (i.i.sc.), bangalore, a few of us students of physics from i.i.sc. and national aeronautic laboratory were introduced to this joyous 12 experience by s.k.rangarajan, formerly a professor of chemistry, in whose house we assembled virtually every evening to discuss such grave issues as amorphous solids and renormalization group. each one of the discussants has made a mark” (current science, 75(1998)pp.1262). for a discussion on emotional factors see, for example, ref.[5]. d.crucial stage of ph.d the crucial period for a research scholar doing full-time ph.d. is the last year of the programme. during this period one should concentrate on completing the final work for his thesis and writing of various chapters. generally, a research fellowship is for fixed period of time, it might have ended before the final year of the ph.d. programme. we have noticed many scholars converted the full-time programme into part-time and joined in a job. if the job is a permanent one then one can join in the job and continue the research. but joining in a temporary position may highly change his research career. this would delay the submission of his ph.d. thesis and he may loose the interest in research. there are examples with students capable of getting a post doctoral fellowship but failed to even continuing the research. therefore, a research scholar should have a clear plan of what he has to do in the next few years or so. even if the fellowship is not available at the finishing stage of ph.d. thesis we have friends and our well wishers to give financial support to some extend. xi. actual investigation one should aim at doing good research. what is good research? which universities and research institutions in your country do the best research? how do you distinguish the great from a good, a black hole from an ordinary hole, a superconductor from a normal conductor, supernova from mere stars, poles from ordinary points, linear differential equations from nonlinear ones? to distinguish one from another we can use various quantities. like wise, to identify the best from among the available, one can use various quantities to measure the quality of them. for example, to identify a best research the quality of the one’s research publications, number of citations of his publications, projects completed, books published, contribution made to the science and society, etc. can be considered. research work (1) published in reputed international journals, (2) cited by other researchers working in the same or similar topic and(3) which added new information to the existing knowledge on a topic are generally considered as good. at the beginning of research career a young researcher should aim to produce a good research, particularly, his research findings should distinguish him from other researchers and keep him one among the top young researchers in the nation. in order to encourage young researchers and motivate them to produce high quality of research work awards are given yearly by certain academic and research bodies in each country. for example, in india, indian president award, indian national science academy (insa) young scientist award and many other awards are given every year. some conference/seminar organizers also provide best papers award to young scientists. a.what are the points to be kept in mind in order to do a good research? actual investigation should lead to original contributionand not involve objectionable duplication. originality is the basic credit point of any research. therefore, actual investigation must be directed towards obtaining novel results . a researcher should develop new ideas and obtain deep insight into the problem in order to get novel and new results which are the characteristics of a good research. trivial analysis should not be performed. recently introduced theories, experimental techniques and numerical algorithms have to be used instead of outdated methods. before applying any method, the researcher should familiarize with the features of the method. it it not worthwhile to continue in a particular direction if the results are trivial and less informative. if similar problems have already been done, for instance about ten years ago, then a researcher should not consider it as important but could treat it as a useful exercise. we do research by conceiving information and openings from important research papers published by other researchers in the topic of interest and continue in our own directions. the work of some other researchers might have formed the basis of our research. similarly, our research outcomes should help other researchers. that is, the work should be such that it should invite others to read and more importantly use it and cite it in their research work. our work should lead to recognition and respect. it should fetch joy and benefits others and as well as us. as pointed out by professor m.lakshmanan, generally, each and every work of us may not produce novelty, but if we work towards novelty then definitely in the course 13 of research there would come a fascinating and exciting breakthrough . the researcher must remember that ideally in the course of a research study, there should be constant interaction between initial hypothesis, observation and theoretical concepts. it is exactly in this area of interaction between theoretical orientation and observation that opportunities for originality and creativity lie. actual work finally leads to results and conclusions of the research undertaken. for proper results it is necessary that various steps of the work should be scientifically taken and should not have any flaw. developed computer algorithms must be tested for the problems for which results are already available. the work should be free from mistakes. important analysis must be repeated in order to make sure that they are free from human mistakes. professor devanathan suggests that a researcher should check, recheck, cross check, ... all the results before submitting a research paper to a journal . before beginning to write a part of the work done and the results obtained check and recheck the data and the results by repeating the experiment, rerunning the programs and going through the theoretical derivations and arguments. when analysing the data, appropriate statistical tools have to be employed. the number of data used, units of the data, error bars and other necessary details must be noted in the graphs. as many statistical tools as possible should be used. appropriate curve fitting can be done. necessary interpretations on the results of statistical analysis have to be made. in the case of development or modification of a theory and proposal of a new method the assumptions made, basic idea, and calculations should be clearly stated and analyzed. various special cases of the theory or method must be identified. the validity, efficiency and applicability of it must be demonstrated with examples. merits and demerits have to be identified. comparison of the proposed method with the already existing and widely used similar methods should be performed. in any experimental work, mere measurement of certain quantities is not enough. the interpretation of the kind of data observed and explanation for the particular pattern must be made. on the basis of interpretation general principles underlying the process can be formulated. one has to check whether the generalizations are universal and true under different conditions. some common errors made in research are [6] (1) selective observation (2) inaccurate observation (3) over-generalization (4) made-up information(5) ex post facto hypothesizing (6) illogical reasoning (7) ego involvement in understanding (8) premature closure of inquiry (9) mystification for a very interesting discussion on the above aspects with examples refer to the ref.[6] xii. results and conclusion the next step after performing the actual research work on the chosen problem is preparation of results and conclusion of the performed work. predictions, results and conclusion are ultimate goals of the research performed. there are two indispensable rules of modern research. the freedom of creative imagination necessarily subjected to rigorous experimentation. in the beginning any experimental research on a specific subject, imagination should give wings to the thought. at the time of concluding and interpreting the facts that were collected observation, the imagination should be dominated and prevailed over by concrete results of experiments. proper interpretations of the results must be made. interpretation refers to the task of drawing inferences from the actual research work . it also means drawing of conclusion. conclusion is based on the study performed. it would bring out relations and processes that underlie the findings. the utility of the outcome of the research greatly lie on proper interpretations and is the hardest part of solving a scientific problem. interpretation of results is important because it (1) links the present work to the previous, (2) leads to identification of future problems, (3) opens new avenues of intellectual adventure and stimulates the quest for more knowledge, (4) makes others understand the significance of the research findings and (5) often suggests a possible experimental verification. the basic rule in preparing results and conclusion is to give all the evidences relevant to the research problem and its solution. a bare statement of the findings are not enough. their implications must be pointed out. discuss your answers to the following questions with experts: (1) are the supporting evidences sufficient?, and if not, what to do? 14 (2) how many pieces of evidence are required? instead of producing all, is it possible to restrict to one or two pieces of evidence? if so, what are they? and (3) why are they sufficient? and so on. such directions can help us minimize work and the quantity of presentation of the report. do not rely on a bogus evidence which would increase the chances of errors. the investigator has to give suggestions. these should be practical and based on logic, reasoning and fact. the suggestions should be such that they can be actually implemented. the researcher should not be in hurry while preparing the results and conclusion. after preparing them the researcher may ask the following questions: (1) are the quantitative and qualitative analysis performed adequate for the conclusion drawn? (2) are the results and conclusion general ? (3) are the results and conclusion valid only for the particular situation considered in the present work? (4) is the conclusion too broad considering the analysis performed? (5) is any evidence which weaken the conclusion omitted? the results and conclusion prepared can be revised based on the answers to the above questions. each and every statement made in the results and conclusion sections must be based on evidence obtained from theoretical or experimental analysis. baseless statement s should never be made. assignment: (9) for each of the following topics write at least two questions, the answers to which must be available in the respective topics. for example, for the topic, “introduction ”, a relevant question is ‘why am i doing it?’. (i) introduction, (ii) review of a research topic, (iii) methodology, (iv) research design, (v) results, (vi) discussion and (vii) conclusion. xiii. presenting a scientific seminar-oral report a.what is an oral report? what are the importance of an oral report? presentation of one’s research work in a scientific meeting is an oral report . scientific meetings include conference, seminar, symposium, workshop, departmental weekly seminar, etc.researchers in certain research institutions not only discuss their own work but also have discussions on very recently reported work of other scientists. an oral report provides a bridge between the researcher and audience and offers greater scope to the researcher for explaining the actual work performed, its outcome and significance. it also leads to a better understanding of the findings and their implications. in an oral report, the researcher can present the results and interpretations which are not clearly understood by him and may request the experts in the audience to give their opinions and suggestions. oral reporting at a conference or a seminar requires more elaborate preparation than the written report. a nobel prize winner paul dirac said, “ a person first gets a new idea and he wonders very much whether this idea will be right or wrong. he is very anxious about it, and any feature in the new idea which differs from the old established ideas is a source of anxiety to him. whereas some one else who hears about this work and talks it up doesn’t have this anxiety, an anxiety to preserve the correctness of the basic idea at all costs, and without having this anxiety he is not so disturbed by the contradiction and is able to face up to it and see what it really means.” b.points to be remembered in preparing an oral report before starting the preparation of an oral report, an outline can be drawn based on the time duration of the report and the quality of the audience. departmental seminar is usually 45 minutes duration. in other meetings time duration is fixed by the organizer based on the number of days of the meeting, number of speakers and the status of a speaker. for a long time report, that is, 45–60 minute presentation, one may have enough time to (1) introduce the topic, (2) discuss the definition of the problem, (3) describe the method and technique employed, (4) give technical details, and (5) present results and conclusion. consequently, these aspects can be prepared in detail. for a 15–30 minute, oral presentation one cannot find enough time to discuss complete details of the work. in this case less informative material must be dropped. methods and techniques used can be presented very briefly without going into technical details. much time should be reserved for results, conclusion and further directions. 15 prepare a write-up of the oral presentation. it is a good and very helpful practice to write the talk before presenting it orally. then evaluate the written material. ask: (1)why should the audience listen to your presentation? (2)is the presentation match with the standard of the audience? revise the presentation until you get convincing answer to the above two questions. oral presentation can be made effective and attractive by using modern visual devises, power-points, slides and transparency sheets. title of the report, author’s name, plan of the presentation, very important content of it and conclusion can be printed in the slides or sheets possibly point by point with bold and sufficiently large size letters. important formulas, equations, tables, figures and photographs can be prepared using transparency sheets or slides. slides and transparency sheets should not contain running matters. researcher should not simply read the content in the sheets . that is, the descriptive portion of the report should not be prepared on the sheets. an abstract or a short write-up of the presentation may be circulated to the participants of the meeting. sophisticated softwares developed for preparing the text on transparency sheets/slides are available in internet and can be freely downloaded. in order to make the presentation, more lively, the researcher could use multimedia. nowadays, the use of power-point of microsoft windows is common. it is an easy and compact utility software especially for preparing classroom presentations. the following are the web sites from which one could download the software at free of cost: http://www.office.microsoft.com/downloads http://www.lb.com/download-free-power-pointpresentation.org one could use the audio aspects also to facilitate his presentation in a better way. while presenting the topic, the researcher should strictly follow the class room teaching methodology. for example, one should allow interaction; don’t restrict the vision of the audience of a particular section, don’t forget to modulate the voice as and when required and don’t violate the time frame. one or two rehearsals of the report in the presence of colleagues, supervisor and collaborators can be exercised in order to (1) complete the presentation within the allotted time, (2) improve the quality of presentation and (3) maintain the fluency of the presentation. during a long presentation, the speaker can stop the presentation at various stages, seek comments and questionsfrom the audience and then proceed. this will make the presentation attractive, interesting and also allow the au dience to clarify their doubts so that they can follow the work. xiv. art of writing a research paper and thesis a.what is a research report? research reporting is an oral or a written presentation of important and useful aspects of the research work done. scientific writing, a thesis or a paper, is intended to present clearly the purpose and outcome of a specific research investigation. it is the last but a major part of the research study. a report helps the researcher get feedback from other researchers and experts working in the same field. it also evaluates the success and originality of the researcher’s work. without a report, a research study is incomplete and of no use . a report essentially conveys the outcome of a research work to interested persons. brilliant work and most striking findings are of little value if they are not effectively communicated to the scientific world. as pointed out by eli maor, in academic matters the iron rule is publish or perish . some times delaying a publication of a result one would lose his claim. b.what are research paper or article and ph.d thesis or dissertation? a research paper is a report published in a journal or magazine or conference proceedings, etc. whereas a ph.d. dissertation is a report of the entire work done by a researcher to a university or an institution for the award of the degree of doctor of philosophy. a ph.d. dissertation is a lengthy, original and substantial document. it should contain original contributions. essentially, the role of a ph.d. dissertation is to demonstrate the research person’s original thinking and contribution to the topic of research . it should also clearly point out the research competence of the researcher in his research field. m.phil. dissertation is designed as a practice for ph.d. thesis. it will help the researcher learn and understand the present status of the topic and make him capable of working at the ph.d. level. the work done for an m.phil. dissertation need not be publishable in journals. c.why should a researcher report his findings? every research investigation is carried out with certain objectives . the outcome of a research work may 16 add new information to a theory or may have technological applications. sometimes the researcher may not be aware of the theoretical development on practical applications. his research results may be useful to another research problem. some other researchers may be working or planning to work on the same or similar type of research work. several researchers doing same research work is a waste of time unless the solution of the problem is needed very urgently and is of great use. repetition of a work should be avoided by the research community as much as possible. unless a researcher reports his work to the world, the correctness, validity and originality of the work is under a question mark. the outcome of a research work will become known to the scientific community only through publications. in view of these, it is important to report a work in an appropriate journal or magazine and in scientific meetings like conferences, seminars and symposia. identify possible publications of your research findings after making a considerable progress on a research problem. don’t be confined with a mere ph.d. degree. d.characteristics of a good report a good report results from slow, pain taking and accurate inductive work. to attract a reader, the reading matter of a report should be clear and interesting. it should not be obscure and dull. the write-up should be logical, clear and concise. the basic quality or characteristics of a good scientific report/paper and thesis are the following: (1) good presentation (2) good organization of various chapters/sections (3) accuracy (4) clarity (5) free from contradictions and confusion. further, a ph.d. dissertation should be a formal and should have high level of scholarship. xv. outline of a report what are the considerations to be kept in mind while preparing a report? (1) first, an outline of a report has to be prepared. (2) a sketch of what information to be conveyed must be made. (3) then, one can write down various topics, subtopics to be considered and what material to be presented in them.(4) the sentences which are to be expanded, reworded and verified for its validity can be marked. the outline of the report helps us concentrate on (i) what is to be presented, (ii) logical relationships between different parts of the report, (iii) smooth flow of the content and (iv) continuity in the presentation. the outline can be discussed with the guide, collaborators, colleagues and experts in local area. based on their comments the structure of the report can be modified. a three stage preparation of a report is generally done by researchers. they are (1) first draft – rough draft . (2) second draft – rewriting and polishing of the rough draft. (3) third draft – writing the final draft . a.first draft in this stage a researcher can write (1) what has been done in the research study, (2) procedure, method, theory and technique applied, (3) technical difficulties faced and how they are overcome, (4) broad findings and (5) concluding remarks. tables and charts can be typeset using computer and kept separately in order to avoid rewriting them. conclusion should be precise, clear and objective. further directions may be pointed out. since a research paper is identified by its title it should be brief and not more than above 10-15 words. a subject index of a paper is primarily based on the words in the title. therefore, few key words which are helpful to classify the paper can be included appropriately in the title. how does a reader decide whether to read the content of a paper or not? abstract serves the purpose. by reading the abstract a reader would decide whether the content of the paper is useful to him. therefore, the abstract should have positive information about the content of the paper and summary of the work reported in it. further, if the abstract has final results and main conclusion of the paper then a reader who has a general interest in the subject can know the outcome of the paper without reading the entire text by referring the abstract itself. 17 b.second draft this is the most important and difficult part of the writing. extreme care must be taken in writing this draft. unclear points, jargons, weakness of the report have to be identified and revised. over-generalization of outcomes should be avoided. for example, hermitian operators have real eigenvalues. generalizing it as eigenvalues of operators are real or concluding that to have real eigenvalues, operators should be hermitian are incorrect. similarly, complex analytic functions satisfy cauchy–riemann conditions. it doest not mean that functions satisfying cauchy–riemann conditions should be analytic. how do you avoid over-generalization? for some details see, for example, ref.[5]. attention must be paid to the arguments made, logical flow of work presented, the quality of supporting evidences and conclusion drawn. do these in each chapter. don’t do the entire second stage at a single stretch. give sufficient time between revisions of two consecutive chapters. during the break time think over the revision made in the previous chapter or section. more importantly, grammar must be checked. a careful spell check must be made. use simple words as far as possible. indecisive words such as perhaps, somewhat, rather, etc. should be avoided. usage of some particular words repeatedly, for example, ‘very’, ‘extraordinary ’, ‘invariably’ should be avoided. expressions such as ‘it seems’, ‘there may be’, ‘since’, ‘putting’, etc. should be replaced by appropriate equivalent words. style, presentation and grammar can be improved by asking your friends, colleagues to read and give their critical comments, suggestions and correct english grammar. in some universities the report is first read by an english teacher. he corrects the grammar and give suggestions. after this only a researcher can submit the thesis. complicated and lengthy sentences have to be rewritten and broken. similar sentences or sentences conveying same information must be eliminated. check whether the words used clearly convey exactly the meaning intended. s. chandrasekhar said, “ i always sought to present my findings in as elegant, even literary, a form as possible. i select some writers in order to learn. for example, i read henry james or virginia woolf, and i don’t simply read the text as a novel; i see how they construct sentences, how they construct paragraphs, how one paragraph goes into another and so on. ” (j. horgan, current science, 67 (1994) pp.500-01). proper references of related work should be included. trivial matters and obvious conclusion should not be included and if there are such sentences then they should be dropped.c.third draft this is the last stage. in this stage, one can concentrate on final touches and finishing . this should be in the direction of making the report weighty, authoritative, attractive and convincing. similar words and format should be avoided in successive sentences. make sure that the script clearly shows the originality of the author and importance of the outcome of the study performed. in all the three stages of report preparation one should follow a proper style of writing. use clear and unadorned english appropriate for the readers. one has to be aware of to whom the research report is intended. the report is not for the supervisor. it is better to avoid the use of personal pronoun. use of “i” and “the author” should be avoided. some supervisors like to use “we”. for an interesting fun about the usage of “i” and “we” see p.106 of “why are things the way they are?” by g. venkataraman (university press, hyderabad, 1992). both active and passive voice should be used wherever necessary or appropriate. however, when using them one should check whether the meaning is strictly correct. for example, when writing “the experimental results agree with the theory” we must check whether we are strengthening the experimental result or the theory. care must be taken in using present and past tenses. use past tense to describe the data collection and work done by others and you. for interpretation, assessments and discussions present tense is appropriate. between various stages it is advisable to give gap of few days so that one can leisurely think of the manuscript and record how to revise it. this will avoid unnecessary tension and half-hearted write up. xvi. layout of a research report / ph.d. thesis / m.phil. dissertation the layout of a research report is the list of various parts of the report/thesis. generally, a research report should consist of the following three components: (1) preliminary pages (2) main text (3) end matters a. preliminary pages preliminary pages include title of the report, acknowledgement, certificate page, list of publications and table o f contents . acknowledgements are written to thank those who have helped the researcher during their course of investigation. for a book it is in the form of preface or forward. acknowledgement should be brief, simple, modest 18 and given only to substantial assistance provided by the guide, head of the department, staff of the department, agencies which provided financial support, collaborators and institutions where part of the work has been carried out. acknowledgements made for routine participation by members of the researcher’s family, librarian, friends, clerical helpers and god are normally considered superfluous. acknowledgement should be made at the time of public viva-voce also. there is a chance for a researcher to forget to say acknowledgement at the end of the presentation. to avoid this he may do it at the beginning of the presentation. an important point is to consider the tone to adopt so that you sound genuine. every research report should have an abstract . it is a necessary part of any scientific and nonscientific research report. in a research article it appears next to the author’s name and affiliation. in the case of ph.d. thesis, before its submission an elaborated abstract of the thesis called synopsis has to be submitted to the institution where registration for ph.d. degree is made. abstract and synopsis convey the essence and brief details about the report. it should contain a very short statement of the problem, methodology and procedures adapted in the work and results of the study in a very condensed form. the abstract can act as a tool to control the flow of ideas in the thesis . it can help you link in a logical way the reasons for the research and aims of the work. it should contain answers to the questions: what was done in the project? why is it of interest? how was it done? what were the outcomes of the work done? what is the significance of the results? one should emphasize the original contribution in the abstract. the abstract of a ph.d. thesis will be about three or four pages. table of contents gives title of the chapters, section headings, title of appendices and their page numbers . in the certificate page the researcher should undertake that the work reported has not been reported earlier by him or by any one else for the award of any degree. it should also mention that the work is done by the researcher and not copied from any other source. all the preliminary pages should be numbered with lower-case roman numbers. b. main text the main text presents the details of the research work and results. this part of the thesis should provide the following, about the research work: (1) introduction (2) actual research work performed and the findings (3) summary and conclusion.1.introduction the purpose of the introduction is to give a brief outline of the field of research. in this part one can bring clearly the importance of the field and the current status of it. it should contain an overview of the problem, its importance, statements about the hypothesis or specific questions to be explored. this is followed by a preview of the scheme of the following chapters, that is an outline of plan of the work. here, aim of each of the chapters and their contents can be briefly stated. related and relevant work done by others must be pointed out. various concepts and definitions of scientific and technical terms necessary for understanding the research work undertaken are to be defined and explained. details of statistical tools or quantities used in the study can be given in a separate chapter. irrelevant and less informative materials need not be presented. for example, regular and irregular behaviour of solution of a system or differential equation can be characterized by calculating the statistical tools such as lyapunov exponents, correlation function, correlation di mension, power spectrum, periodicity of the solution and probability distribution. if the power spectrum is not used in a research work then there is no need to discuss in detail the systematic way of calculating it. similarly, suppose the effect of noise in a theoretical model equation is studied by including, say, gaussian random numbers in the simulation. there are many methods available to generate gaussian random numbers. if the box–muller method is used then it can be described. in this case describing other methods, for example, rejection technique is redundant to the present thesis report. the theory and experimental set up used should be clearly described with proper references. define the technical terms used in the dissertation either by a reference to a previously published definition or by a precise definition. such a definition should be given only once in the report. the introductory chapter(s) should be prepared in such a way that it should interest the reader in the subject matter of research. it should not be aimless, confused and laking in precision. introductory part may contain one or two chapters. to be precise, the introductory part should cover the following aspects: (1) features of the topic (2) present status of the field (3) some unsolved problems (4) statement of the problem undertaken (5) importance and justification of the present problem 19 (6) preview of the scheme of the following chapters and their interrelationship definition of various scientific terms used, and (7) methodology used. 2.actual research work this is the heart of the research report/thesis. the actual research work undertaken, difficulties faced, technical details, results, conclusion and future direction fo rm the main part of this portion. this part can be presented in a few chapters. each chapter should contain introduction, research work, results and conclusion. materials should be organized systematically and presented under appropriate headings and subheadings. first, write the chapters that describe your actual research work. after this, prepare the conclusion and introduction parts. when writing the actual work collect the terms and note down the matter which are to be defined and described in the introduction. as professor p.r. subramanian points out, for preparing the ph.d. thesis report one should not simply copy word by word from his research articles . even if the content of the thesis is the work reported in his research publications, the student should reword the material without changing the meaning, give much more details, explanations, suggestions and possibly a better reorganization of the content. wherever possible, the results should be presented in the form of figures, illustrations and tables. they can make the report quite attractive. tables should be as precise as possible. all the figures should clearly specify the variables of the axes, units used and other necessary information. figure caption should not be a reproduction of sentences of the text. it must clearly state what it is. figures should be clearly explained in the text. data should be fitted to an appropriate mathematical expression. nowadays, sophisticated softwares are available for curve fitting. after making a curve fit or plotting a set of data, proper explanation for observed variation of the data should be given. a set of data measurement without any analysis and discussion is of no use. extreme care must be taken in type setting mathematical equations, variables and parameters involved in the study. italic or greek letters or mathematical symbols can be used for variables and parameters. for example, x or x should not be used as a variable name. the correct usage is xorx(or typeset in italics). all the equations should be centered and numbered. vectors should be clearly specified by an arrow over the name or by bold face name. equations should not be repeated. jokes or puns should not find a place in the report. use “correct” or “incorrect” to refer to the resultsof others. don’t use the words “bad”, “terrible” and “stupid”. avoid use of “today”, “modern times”, “soon”, “seems”, “in terms of”, “based on”, “lots of”, “type of”, “something like”, “just about”, “number of”, “probably”, “obviously”, “along with”, “you”, “i”, “hopefully” and “may”. there is no need to mention the circumstances in which the results are obtained. assignment: (10) reword/rephrase the following and give the reason for the change: (a) dinesh and geethan [1] reported that ... (b) the following algorithm represents a major breakthrough .... (c) even though the above method is not earthshaking .... (d) geethan and i obtained .... (e) there is a method to calculate .... (f) the program will use the data after it stored them to a cd ... (g) the method is started by calculating the value ofδ.... 3.conclusion at the end of each of chapter, one can place a brief summary of the outcome of the work presented in that chapter under the heading conclusion. they should be clear and precise. the relevant questions which are still not answered and new questions raised by the work of the present chapter have to be mentioned. whether the answers to the questions are obtained or not, if obtained in which chapter(s) they are presented should be specified. mention possible future research. it is important to make a connection between two consecutive chapters either at the end of the first or at the beginning of the second. chapters should not look like reports of isolated work. there should be a link between consecutive chapters and the link should be clearly brought out. c. end matters the end part of the report generally consists of references, appendices, computer programs (if they are not easy to develop) and copies of research publications that came out from the research work done. 20 1.appendices appendices are supplementary contents which are not placed in the main report in order to keep the continuity of the discussion; however, they are relevant for understanding the particular part of the report. an appendix may present (1) a brief summary of a theory or a numerical method used which can be found elsewhere, (2) a lengthy mathematical derivation or a large set of equations, (3) technical details and (4) a list of values of constants and parameters used in the work. appendices can be placed at the end of report after references. they should be numbered by capital alphabets. 2.references/bibliography references or bibliographies are sources consulted. each reference should contain name(s) of author(s), title of the paper, journal name, volume number of the issue in which the article appeared, starting page number, end page number and year of publication. in the case of a book source its author(s), title, publishers’s name, place of publication, year of publication and edition should be given. some examples are given below. (1) suppose the reference is the paper of k. murali, sudeshna sinha and w.l. ditto with title “implementation of nor gate by a chaotic chua’s circuit” appeared in the journal called ‘international journal of bifurcations and chaos’ in the year 2003, the volume number of corresponding issue is 13 and the starting and ending page numbers of the article are 2669 and 2672 respectively. the above article can be specified as (without mentioning the title of the article) k. murali, sudeshna sinha and w.l. ditto, int. j bifur. and chaos 13 (2003) 2669–2672. (2) for an article which appeared in a conference proceedings a typical format is given below: r. harish and k.p.n. murthy, “intermittency and multifractality in iterated function systems”. in: nonlinear systems. eds. r. sahadevan and m. lakshmanan (narosa, new delhi, 2002) pp. 361–371. in the above “intermittency....” is the title of the report of r. harish and k.p.n. murthy. “nonlinear systems” is the title of the conference proceedings edited by r. sahadevan and m. lakshmanan.the proceeding was published in the year 2002 by narosa publishing house, new delhi. in the proceedings the article appears from the to . (3) a book can be noted down as, for example t. kapitaniak, “controlling chaos” (academic press, san diego, 1996). (4) a ph.d. thesis can be referred as shown below: s. parthasarathy, “on the analytic structure and chaotic dynamics of certain damped driven nonlinear oscillators”. ph.d. thesis. (bharathidasan university, 1993, unpublished). (5) for an unpublished manuscript downloaded from internet one can note down the web site where it is available (see for example the references 5 and 6 of the references section of this manuscript). references can be either in alphabetical order according to author’s name or the order in which they are referred in the report. make sure that each reference cited in the text is correctly entered into the list of references. repetition of references in the list should be avoided. d. typing the report typing should conform to the set of requirements of the institution. the thesis should be double line spaced and not more than 25 lines per page. it may be typed on both sides. chapter heading must be in large size with bold face. each paragraph should be right margin aligned. important terms when used first time can be in italic letters and bold face. first word of a sentence should not be an abbreviation. latest softwares such as latex or word can be used for thesis, dissertation and report preparation. one could download the software latex a free of cost from the web sites: 1) http://www.ctan.org 2) http://www.miktex.org if a report is prepared keeping all the above precautions in mind, there is every likelihood of it becoming useful for proper study. such report enables the reader to comprehend the data and to determine for himself the validity of the conclusion. before or immediately after submitting hard copies of the ph.d. dissertation to a university, show it to your colleagues, teachers, scientists of your department, your parents and friends . xvii. acknowledgement we acknowledge valuable discussion with professor m. sivasankaran nair, dr k. balasubramanian and 21 dr e. subramanian. we are very grateful to professor p.r. subramanian and dr k.p.n. murthy for a critical reading of the manuscript and their suggestions which greatly improved the presentation of the manuscript. we are thankful to prof.v.devanathan, dr.k.p.n.murthy and dr.sudeshna sinha for their suggestions to young researchers. references: 1. c. r. kothari, research methodology: methods and techniques (wiley eastern, new delhi, 1985). 2. p. saravanavel, research methodology (kitab mahal, allahabad, 1987). 3. e. m. phillips and d. s. pugh, how to get a ph.d.?

prof. v. devanathan : motivation and innate interest in the topic of his research pursuit are the requirements for asuccessful research career. if a person takes the research not by compulsion but by his own choice, then he will not feel it as a burden but pursue it as a hobby. “science is at its best when it is a part of a way of life” - this is the inscription that is found on the foundation stone of institute of mathematical sciences, chennai and truly describes the correct aptitude for a successful research career. is it possible for an average student to come up with novel results in a research problem? if so, what kind of approach he should follow? prof. v. devanathan : usually, the assessment of a student as good, average or bad is based on his performance in the examinations. there are some who are good in examinations with a good memory for reproduction but lack in deeper understanding of the subject and originality in approach. there are some who are not so good in examinations but show originality in thinking and follow unconventional or novel approach to the subject. there are a few who are good both in examinations and research. so, an average student with an ability of average performance in the examinations, need not feel different if he has originality in thinking andself-confidence . during a research career, a young researcher may come across disappointing moments like not getting expected results, rejection of a research article from a journal, etc . what kind of mode of approach a researcher should have to face such situations? prof. v. devanathan : “success begets success and failure begets failure.” success and failure are like two sides of a coin and one is bound to face them alternatively in the course of one’s research career. elation at the time of success and depression at the time of failure are usually mitigated if one works in collaboration with others. at the time of depression, the co-workers come to the rescue and prop up the sagging spirit. in our manuscript we have mentioned the following: each and every bit of work has to be done by the researcher. a young researcher should not do the entire work in collaboration with others. the researcher is advised to perform all the work starting from identification of the problem to report preparation by himself under the guidance of supervisor. please give your views on this point. prof. v. devanathan : at the initial stages, the researcher gets the support of the research group in which he is working and he acquires the knowledge of the group effortlessly. the weekly informal seminars, if conducted within the group, will increase the pace of learning and help to clarify and crystallize the problems. this process of learning is made easier if the young researcher works in collaboration with others. this is true both for theoretical and experimental work. at present, the experimental work is almost a team work and successful research group 22 is one in which the group leader allots the specified work to individuals taking into account his ability and expertise. 2. interview with dr k.p.n. murthy the common belief is that research is laborious and painful. many times you have mentioned: “doing research is an entertainment.” please, elaborate on this statement of yours. dr k.p.n. murthy : research not only constitute a discovery or creating a new paradise but also consist of obtaining a personalized understanding of a phenomenon. the struggle that you go through for obtaining an insight into a phenomenon or getting a hold of a nuance and the extessy that you get when you get an understanding of a phenomenon or obtaining a new way of explaining of that phenomenon may be unmatched. this ecstasy is nothing to do with what yours creative have impact on science and society. however, it is the ecstasy of what einstein got when he created special theory of relativity or feynman when he created quantum electrodynamics or raman when he found the so-called raman lines. it is this makes the research an enterprise of joy. it is that makes a research an entertainment. is it necessary for a beginner of research to learn all the aspects of theoretical, experimental and numerical techniques involved in a topic before he take-up an actual research problem? dr k.p.n. murthy : a certain basic knowledge about physics and mathematics is must for starting research. that is it. several things you learn doing research. ignorance of even some of the basic elements is no hindrance for creativity. what is required for doing good research is an enthusiasm, a commitment and willingness to go back to basics and learn them right. before preparing the final write-up of your research work, you have the practice of discussing the salient features of your findings with a few other researchers. how are you benefited from this? dr k.p.n. murthy : after you have completed a piece of work i find it is a good practice to discuss with your colleagues the important findings that you have made. i have always realized that i got a better understanding of what i have done when i tried to explain to my colleagues about my work in a convincing way. the very act of speaking of what you have done removes the cob-webs in your understandings. i always make it to give a seminar on my work to a larger audience before submitting it to a journal for publication. i feel this is a very good and helpful practice. “enjoy doing research and approach it as an entertainment and a mode of getting happiness.” this is your suggestion to young researchers. please, brief it for the ben-efit of youngsters. in what way will this be helpful to a researcher? dr k.p.n. murthy : in any human enterprise it is important that one likes what one does. the hard work that you have put in a problem does not tired you and rest be assured if you approach a research problem with joy and you will get a good result. publication of that result and the acceptance that you get from your colleagues become secondary. the satisfaction that you obtained by doing a job well is a reward by itself. i would say that youngsters should have this attitude towards whatever they do. 3. interview with dr sudeshna sinha despite unavoidable tasks a woman of our country has, you have become one of the leading scientists in theoretical physics. what are your advice and suggestions to young researchers particularly to young women researchers? dr sudeshna sinha : it is indeed somewhat harder for women to concentrate on career planning - especially when their children are young. one will have to accept that household tasks will always be there. the hardest thing is not really the number of hours of work one can put in - but the quality of concentration one can achieve. here discipline comes in. since women will probably manage to get fewer hours of academic work done every day - they need to really plan the academic work they hope to achieve every single day. so it is most beneficial to discipline oneself into shutting off all daily chores from one’s mind for some hours every day. the point is to learn efficiency – and to appreciate that one does not have the benefit of unlimited time (as others will make justifiable demands on your time – like children). also women may find it hard to pursue academic work at certain points in their life - but they must preserve the self-confidence and will to return to academic after such times are over. they must realize that in 3–4 decades of working life – a few years is not a big deal. they should not think that a break in career is irreversible . publishing in reputed journals (like physical review letters) is a dream or prestige for many physicists. what are the secret of yours for regular publications in reputed journals? what type of problems one has to take up for getting published in top-level journals? dr sudeshna sinha : with journals like physical review letters one must remember two things: first, always try and make a case of the general interest of your results. the commonest grounds for rejection is lack of broad interest. this is very subjective of course, and being indian does not help. but still, at the outset, one should make an attractive statement of the general scope of one’s work (that is, try to answer this hypothetical question: why should someone not doing research in this exact narrow sub-field be interested in reading my paper). second point is persistence. take all criticisms of the paper 23 seriously (and don’t reply needlessly aggressively to the referees) and try to answer all the criticisms. then resubmit, and don’t give up till the last round! how could a beginner of research come up with novel results? dr sudeshna sinha : well, i think coming up with novel results is not entirely in one’s hand. there is an element of good fortune here! if the guide of the young researcher can identify a problem that is technically easy to tackle – but whose results can be of considerable potential interest – then there is a good chance for the young researcher to get a novel result. but this is not in the hands of the young researcher, and most often not in the hands of the guide either (as it depends on the subject, timing etc.). in this matter i always tell my students: whether you get a novel result tomorrow is amatter of luck, but in a career spanning several decades, if you work steadily and think deeply about the subject, it is almost assured that at some point or the other, you will get a good idea which will lead to a novel result! to get a deep insight into the topic or problem of research, what are the ways a young researcher can follow? dr sudeshna sinha : one should not just passively read papers or books! one should try to work it all out in some detail. while reading passively one feels one has understood – but only when one is trying to solve something does one gain any real understanding. in fact it is a great idea to look at the title and abstract of a paper, and then ask oneself how one would have attempted to work on such a problem and only then look at what the authors have done.",
